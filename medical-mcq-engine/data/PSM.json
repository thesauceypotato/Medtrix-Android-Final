These droplet nuclei remain airborne for long periods of time and can transmit diseases like tuberculosis, influenza, chickenpox, measles, Q fever and other respiratory infections. Droplet transmission, vertical transmission, and contact with soil are methods of direct transmission of diseases. Differences between droplet and droplet nuclei are summarised below: DROPLET NUCLEI DROPLET Indirect transmission Direct transmission It is the residue from evapora ted droplets It is produced while coughing, sneezing, talking <5microns in diameter 5 microns in diameter No need for close contact for transmission Requires closeness and direct contact for transmission Diseases transmitted: chicke npox, measles etc. Diseases transmitted: diphth eria, meningococcal meningit is etc.",

Advantages of simultaneous administration of vaccines: The organisms multiply in the host and thus, the antigenic dose is larger than what is injected. They have all the major and minor antigenic components. Live vaccines should not be administered to those with an immunocompromised state, since they may cause severe systemic disease by way of viremia/bacteriemia. Note: If live vaccines are not given simultaneously, they must be spaced as follows- The administration of two live parenteral vaccines or live intranasal influenza vaccines must be separated by at least 4 weeks (28 days). If two live vaccines are given less than 4 weeks apart, the second vaccine should be repeated in four weeks.

A PC value of > 1 indicates that it is more effective than phenol. The higher the number, the greater its effectiveness in comparison to phenol and vice versa. Traditional organisms used to test the power of the disinfectant include S. aureus and Salmonella enteric subtype typhi. Phenol coefficient = The dilution of test disinfectant which kills microorganisms in a given time ÷ The dilution of phenol which kills the microorganism in the same time under identical conditions. Other tests that are used for disinfectants are as follows: Chick Martin test - modification of the Rideal-Walker test where disinfectants act in the presence of organic matter like feces or yeast to simulate natural conditions Kelsey-Skyes test (capacity test) - tests the capacity of a disinfectant to retain its activity when used repeatedly. In-use test - determines whether the chosen disinfectant is effective in actual hospital use Joseph Lister first introduced phenol (carbolic acid) as an antiseptic to sterilize surgical instruments and clean wounds. Lister's work led to a reduction in postoperative infections and made surgery safer for patients, distinguishing him as the 'Father of Modern Surgery' and 'Father of Antiseptic Surgery'.",

In developing countries, 75% of the children acquire their first rotavirus infection in the first 12 months. The universal occurrence of rotavirus infections shows that clean water supply and good hygiene are unlikely to have a substantial effect on virus transmission. In tropical areas, rotavirus diarrhea occurs throughout the year, increasing in frequency in drier, cooler climates. Transmission is through the feco-oral route, person-to-person contact, or indirectly through fomites.

The number of microfilaria carriers is <1%. Following the failure to achieve ELF by 2015, the target set to eliminate lymphatic filariasis by WHO was 2020. To achieve the same WHO recommended the use of triple therapy for lymphatic filariasis. It incorporated ivermectin along with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and albendazole instead of the traditional DEC and albendazole therapy, for the elimination of transmission of lymphatic filariasis. In 2021, WHO released the 'Road Map for Neglected Tropical Diseases (2021–2030)'. Under this, lymphatic filariasis is targeted for elimination as a public health problem by 2030. In February 2023, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in India launched a nationwide Sarva Dawa Sevan or Mass Drug Administration (MDA) campaign to eliminate LF by 2027, aiming to achieve this goal three years ahead of the global target.",

Some other principles of the MDM are: The meal provided under the MDM should only be a supplement and not a substitute for home iets. The cost of meals should be reasonably low. The meal should be easy to cook in schools. Locally available foods must be used, for as far as possible. The menu should be regularly changed to avoid monotony. Note: In September 2021, the Mid-Day Meal Scheme was renamed PM POSHAN or Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman.",

The benefits are expressed in monetary terms to determine whether a given programme is economically sound and to select the best out of several alternate programmes. The main drawback with this technique is that the benefits in the health field, as a result of a particular programme, cannot always be expressed in monetary terms. We generally express the benefit in terms of births or deaths prevented, or illness avoided or overcome. In cost-effective analysis, the benefit is expressed in terms of results achieved. (Eg: number of lives saved or number of days free from disease). Input-output analysis: how much input is needed to produce a unit amount of output. In the health field, input refers to all health service activities which consume resources (manpower, money, materials, and time); and output refers to useful outcomes such as cases treated, lives saved, or inoculations performed.

National Policy for Rare Diseases is a comprehensive policy for the prevention and management of rare diseases. The policy lists rare diseases under 3 groups: Group 1: Disorders amenable to one-time curative treatment: Disorders amenable to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation eg: lysosomal storage disorders Disorders amenable to organ transplantation eg: glycogen storage disorders, urea cycle isorders, ADPKD, etc. Group 2: Diseases requiring long term/ lifelong treatment having a relatively lower cost of treatment: This group includes disorders managed with special dietary formulae/ hormone/ specific drugs. eg: phenylketonuria, osteogenesis imperfecta, etc. Group 3: Diseases for which definitive treatment is available but treatment is lifelong or expensive: This group includes diseases such as Pompe disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, etc. The objectives of the policy are: Lowering the high cost of treatment for rare diseases with an increased focus on indigenous research. Creating a national hospital-based registry of rare diseases. Early screening and prevention through primary and secondary health care infrastructure, an through counselling for the high-risk parents.

Vit C enhances the absorption of iron from the stomach by acting as a reducing substance. Subclinical folate deficiency is seen in up to 30% of North Indian pregnant women. Moreover, it may be masked by widespread iron deficiency. It is, for this reason, iron and folate supplementation is carried out in national programmes. Clinical vitamin B12 deficiency is not commonly encountered, but subclinical cases might be seen in up to 30% of adults and children due to widespread restriction to consumption of vegetarian products only. Hence supplementing vitamin B12 is a good idea provided the cost factor is not an issue. Option B: Iron (III) hydroxide polymaltose was marketed as being superior to iron sulfate in terms of efficacy, but it lacked any data to back up the evidence. Option C: Ferrous fumarate may be considered for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia with similar efficacy as that of ferrous sulfate.

It is most commonly used for desalination of brackish water and sea water. The membrane pore size is < 0.002 µm. Nanofiltration - Allows monovalent ions such as sodium or potassium to pass but rejects a high proportion of divalent ions like calcium and magnesium and some higher molecular weight organics. The membrane pore size ranges from 0.001 – 0.01 µm. Lower-pressure processes: Ultrafiltration - Rejects organic molecules of molecular weight > 800 daltons. The membrane pore size ranges from 0.002 - 0.003 µm. Microfiltration - Rejects colloidal and suspended material. It does not separate molecules and is usually used before reverse osmosis.

Aspiration occurs when there is an obstruction as wind bypasses it and creates a suction action Diffusion is the passage of air through small spaces or openings Cross-ventilation is when air is allowed a natural path through the space by providing openings at appropriate places, opposite each other. The drawback of natural ventilation is that regulation of air quality is not possible. Mechanical ventilation includes: Exhaust ventilation utilizes exhaust fans placed high up near the roof on the external walls. A vacuum is created by which fresh air enters the ventilated space. Plenum ventilation uses centrifugal fans to blow fresh air into the room and create a positive pressure, by which vitiated air is pushed out.

This rule states that if a radiograph is being done on the abdomen or pelvis of a woman in her childbearing age, then it should be done during the 10 days following the onset of menstruation. In most situations, there is growing evidence that strict adherence to the \"ten-day rule\" may be unnecessarily restrictive. Since organogenesis starts 3 to 5 weeks post-conception, it was felt that radiation exposure in early pregnancy couldn't result in malformation. Based on this, it was suggested to do away with the 10-day rule and replace it with a 28-day rule. This means that radiological examination if justified, can be carried throughout the cycle until a period is missed. Waste and Sewage Disposal",

In this process, organic matter is broken down into compost. It has manure value and few or no disease-causing pathogens. Bangalore method is an anaerobic method and is also called hot fermentation process. Trenches with a depth of not more than 90cm are used for this. This is done by spreading a layer of refuse (15 cm thick) at the bottom of the trench and nightsoil (5cm thick) is added next. Layers of refuse and nightsoil are added alternatively till the heap rises to 30cm above ground level. The heap is then covered with excavated earth. At the end of 4 – 6 months, decomposition will be completed. Mechanical composting is an aerobic process. In this method, compost is manufactured on a large scale by processing raw materials and turning out a finished product. The refuse is first cleared of salvageable materials. It is then pulverised to reduce the size of particles to less than 2 inches. The pulverised refuse is then mixed with sewage, sludge or nightsoil in a rotating machine and incubated.",

When a person is in deep-sea (high-pressure zone) for a long time, an increased amount of nitrogen gets dissolved in his body. When he suddenly comes back to the surface (atmospheric pressure or a low-pressure zone), the solubility of gases decreases and they escape from the dissolved state forming nitrogen bubbles. These bubbles can cause sudden expansion of air in various parts of the body such as the middle ear (barotitis), sinuses (barosinusitis), beneath teeth (barodontalgia), intestinal loops (abdominal distension), and emphysema. N trogen bubbles can also cause chokes (dyspnoea), bends (joint pain), and prickles (nerve rritation). The definitive treatment for Caisson's disease is recompression.",

Analytical statistics are the second major category of epidemiological studies, after descriptive statistics. The objective of an analytical study is to test the hypothesis. An observational study is an empiric investigation in which the objective is to establish a relationship between cause and effect. It falls under the category of analytical statistics. It is performed when controlled experimentation cannot be feasibly used to determine a hypothesis. For example, in the case of cigarette smoking causing lung cancer, it would be unethical and not feasible to conduct a controlled experiment. So, an observational study is preferred. Inferential statistics involve inductive reasoning i.e., generalizing observations to a population after having observed only a sample. An example of such a study would be a study determining the expected success rate of vasectomy Theoretical statistics is a mathematical approach to describe something, predict events, or analyze the relationship between things.

There are: Two possible events - inheriting the disease/ not inheriting it Events are mutually exclusive - one person cannot both have the disease and not have it Independent possibilities - if one child has inherited it, this will not affect if the other child will inherit it.

This implies that the remaining 5% lie outside 2 SD, i.e. 2.5% below 2 SD and 2.5% above 2 SD. Therefore , Mean - 2SD = 10.6  2 (2) = 10.6  4 = 6.6 g/dL Thus, 2.5% of pregnant women have Hb levels below 6.6 g/dL. However, the question asks about 5% and not 2.5%. So options C and D have been ruled out. šow Let's move to the next step. Step 2: According to the empirical rule of a normal distribution, 68% of the population fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean, i.e., mean±1SD. This implies that the remaining 32% lie outside 1 SD, i.e., 16% below 1 SD and 16% above 1 SD. The value of mean1 SD is 8.6 g/dL (i.e. 10.6  2) Thus, 16% of pregnant women have Hb levels below 8.6 g/dL. so now option A is ruled out Step 3: The value for 5% must lie between the values where 2.5% and 16% of the population lie, i.e., between 6.6g/dL and 8g/dL. …nly option B, ‹.31 g/dL, satisfies this condition.

Any association that has a 95% confidence interval range that includes the value of 1.0 is considered to be non-significant. The value of 1.0 in the range means that the two factors may co-exist together but one is not causing the other to happen. Odds ratio (OR) is the key parameter in case-control studies to assess the strength of association between the exposure and outcome. The interpretation of the odds ratio can be done as below: OR > 1 indicates a positive association. If both upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence imits are also >1, it suggests that the odds ratio is significant and the factor can be ascertained as a risk factor. OR = 1indicates no association. Irrespective of the odds ratio, if the lower limit of 95% CI is <1 and the upper limit of 95% CI >1, the OR is non-significant and cannot be ascertained either as a protective or a risk factor. OR < 1 indicates a negative association.
