They are not reabsorbed from the renal tubules and are hence excreted unchanged by glomerular filtration. Dose reduction is necessary in renal impairment to avoid the accumulation of the drug and associated toxicity. The non-ionized forms of weak acids and bases undergo tubular reabsorption. Option B: The blood-brain barrier limits the entry of ionized, non-lipid soluble drugs. Option C: A drug is more readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when it is in its unionized, more lipophilic form.

Depolarising neuromuscular blockers (such as suxamethonium) acts by binding to the receptors much longer than ACh and causing a prolonged depolarization, resulting in an eventual blocking of neuromuscular transmission and flaccid paralysis. AChE metabolizes ACh and plasma cholinesterase metabolizes suxamethonium (SCh). Neostigmine blocks both enzymes. By inhibiting AChE, neostigmine increases the ACh concentration in the synaptic cleft. But this cannot reverse the block as the depolarized nerves are unresponsive to any stimuli during this period. However, the simultaneous inhibition of plasma cholinesterase decreases the degradation of SCh and therefore potentiates the neuromuscular block of suxamethonium, resulting in prolonged muscle relaxation. Neostigmine can be used only as a reversal agent for neuromuscular blockade caused by competitive non-depolarising blockers such as vecuronium.",

It has relatively insignificant action on nicotinic receptors. Atropine antagonizes these parasympathetic effects by competitive inhibition of acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors.

Performing stress echocardiography with a pharmacologic agent such as dobutamine allows for simulation of increased heart rate and increased myocardial physiologic demands in patients who may be unable to exercise due to musculoskeletal or pulmonary comorbidities. Dobutamine causes cardiac stress by acting on 1-adrenergic receptors to increase cardiac contractility and heart rate, and on 2-adrenergic receptors to cause peripheral vasodilatation.

These adverse effects are not seen with mirabegron as it acts via adrenergic receptors. Mirabegron is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6.

Ezetimibe acts by interfering with a specific cholesterol transport protein NPC1L1 in the intestinal mucosa and reduces the absorption of both dietary and biliary cholesterol. It causes a compensatory increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis but LDL cholesterol is decreased. Statins block this enhanced cholesterol synthesis (cholesterol synthesis inhibitors) and so their combination has a synergistic effect. Option B: Orlistat is an anti-obesity drug that acts by inhibiting pancreatic and gastric lipase and thus interferes with the digestion and absorption of dietary triglycerides. Option C: Cholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant. The bile-acid sequestrants are highly positively charged and bind negatively charged bile acids. Because of their large size, the resins are not absorbed, and the bound bile acids are excreted in the stool. Cholestyramine primarily reduces LDL levels by increasing hepatic bile acid synthesis; which results in increased LDL uptake and diversion of cholesterol to bile acid production.

Lithium is a mood stabilizer with a very narrow therapeutic index and is the first line of management in bipolar disorder. The kidney handles both lithium and Na+ in the same way via ENac channel. Thus during fasting/dehydration, along with Na+ reabsorption in renal tubules, there will be an increase in the reabsorption of lithium leading to lithium toxicity. Lithium has a very narrow therapeutic index of 0.8-1.2 mEq/L. The severity of lithium toxicity is often divided into the following three grades: A fine tremor is common in patients taking lithium at therapeutic doses. Therapeutic lithium tremor is generally symmetric, limited to the arms, and nonprogressive. The tremor from lithium toxicity is coarser and more disabling, may also affect the legs, and occurs with other symptoms of toxicity. Other adverse effects include mental confusion, hypothyroidism, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and edema. As lithium is readily dialyzed, lithium overdose or toxicity is treated with hemodialysis. *Note - Serum Na+ levels are significant with respect to lithium toxicity, where as serum potassium levels becomes significant in digoxin toxicity.

Restless leg syndrome is a typical sensory-motor disorder that generally affects the legs during rest periods, especially sleep. There is an irresistible urge to shake the legs associated with burning sensation, itching, and cramps of the legs. In idiopathic cases, dopaminergic hypofunction is postulated. In patients with restless legs syndrome, iron stores are initially repleted, and the aggravating factors are eliminated. If RLS still persists, initial therapy with a gabapentinoid (pregabalin, gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil) are preferred, rather than a dopamine agonist (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine). This is due to the high frequency of intermediate and long-term augmentation with dopamine agonists, as well as their risk of impulse control disorders. FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of restless leg syndrome: Gabapentin Ropinirole Pramipexole Rotigotine A dopamine agonist is used as an alternative in patients with increased risk for side effects from gabapentinoids, such as those with obesity and its complications, a past or present history of moderate to severe depression, a disorder causing gait instability or respiratory failure, and a history of substance use disorder.

Tyramine can be produced in high concentrations in protein-rich foods by decarboxylation of tyrosine during fermentation. Normally tyramine is inactivated when taken orally because it is readily metabolized by MAO in the liver. In patients who are on MAO inhibitor therapy, the tyramine taken in the diet is not inactivated and results in its increased sympathomimetic effect resulting in elevated blood pressure, termed as hypertensive crisis or cheese reaction. Drug of choice for cheese reaction is IV phentolamine. When MAO inhibitors are taken along with SSRI or TCA, it results in serotonin syndrome due to the overstimulation of 5HT receptors.

Tricyclic antidepressant overdose presents with anticholinergic effects. Hypotension occurs because of alpha1 receptor blockade. TCAs act on Na+ channels and cause slowed conduction and depressed cardiac contractility resulting in serious arrhythmias. Seizures and agitation may occur followed by depression. Management of TCA overdose: Initial resuscitation by securing airway, breathing, and circulation. Hypotension - IV fluids and norepinephrine infusion. Cardiac-depressant effects - bolus dose of sodium bicarbonate helps overcome Na+ blockade by increasing extracellular Na+. It also addresses metabolic acidosis which is often present. Arrhythmias - lignocaine for ventricular arrhythmias. Seizures - benzodiazepines like diazepam/lorazepam. Physostigmine can reverse anticholinergic effects but can aggravate cardiac depression and cause seizures. Therefore physostigmine is not recommended.",

Naltrexone does not suppress craving in opioid addiction but it suppresses craving in chronic alcoholics. Opioid agonists such as methadone and buprenorphine suppress craving and withdrawal symptoms and are therefore used in the first stage of detoxification in opioid addiction. Option A: Discontinuation of naltrexone ingestion has no negative physical consequences, as opposed to discontinuation of agonist maintenance therapies, which results in the emergence of opioid withdrawal symptoms. This is a major reason for noncompliance and treatment failure. Option C: It blocks the effects of opioids and prevents the user from experiencing subjective symptoms of opioid intoxication such as euphoria on subsequent use. As the user does not experience these symptoms, he does not develop a craving for the substance. Thus, naltrexone prevents relapse. Option D: It is only administered when the patient has completed a medically supervised detoxification from opioids because it can cause immediate withdrawal symptoms.",

Quinine is considered the drug of choice in the first trimester. In the second and third trimesters artemether-lumefantrine can be used, but not in the first trimester. Vivax malaria during pregnancy is treated with chloroquine as chloroquine is safe in pregnancy and children. Clindamycin can be used in children for chloroquine-resistant cases. It is safe to use in children and pregnant women. Option B: Doxycycline is useful in the treatment of malaria but not used in pregnancy. Options C and D: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is not recommended during the 1st trimester of pregnancy because of a lack of safety data.",

High-dose, extended-interval dosing schemes take advantage of the concentration-dependent activity of aminoglycosides to achieve maximal initial bacterial killing. And then because of the postantibiotic effect of aminoglycosides, good therapeutic response can be attained even when concentrations fall below MIC for a substantial fraction of the dosing interval. Therefore, a single daily dose would be equal to or more effective than multiple 8 hourly doses. This dosing strategy may also reduce the ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity of these drugs.

        "explanation": "Resistance by lactamases is through the degradation of antibiotics. The bacterial cell wall is made of heteropolymeric peptidoglycan that confers mechanical stability. The -lactam antibiotics inhibit the last step in peptidoglycan synthesis by acylating the transpeptidase via cleavage of the –CO–N– bond of the -lactam ring. These transpeptidase targets are collectively called Penicillin Binding Proteins (PBPs) Beta-lactamases are enzymes produced by certain bacteria that inactivates -lactam antibiotics by hydrolysis of the -lactam ring in their structure. The resistance to penicillins and other beta-lactam antibiotics can be conferred through one of the four mechanisms: Inactivation of antibiotic by lactamases Modification of target PBPs Impaired penetration of drug to target PBPs Antibiotic efflux",

The bacterial cell wall has long chains of peptidoglycan and is cross-linked to each other by the action of the enzyme transglycosylase. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide group of antibiotics that binds to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of the synthesized peptidoglycan. This inhibits the transglycosylase enzyme and prevents elongation and cross-linking of peptidoglycan. This leads to the weakening of the cell wall causing lysis. It exhibits a time-dependant or concentration-independent killing of bacteria. It primarily acts on Gram +ve organisms which are resistant to other antibiotics such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus and ampicillin resistant enterococci. Lipoglycopeptides are a new generation of glycopeptide congeners which include telavancin, dalbavancin, and oritavancin.

        "explanation": "Isoniazid is the first-line antitubercular drug that acts by inhibiting the synthesis of mycolic acid. Isoniazid is a first-line bactericidal drug that is used for the treatment of tuberculosis. This drug enters bacilli by passive diffusion. It then gets activated to its toxic form by the enzyme catalase-peroxidase(the enzyme encoded by the Kat gene). Normally, InhA and KasA are involved in the synthesis of mycolic acid. Upon activation, the reactive metabolite of isoniazid forms complexes with NAD that inhibit InhA and KasA. Hence, isoniazid inhibits the production of mycolic acid. The reactive isoniazid metabolite also forms complexes with NADP. This complex inhibits mycobacterial dihydrofolate reductase which results in the interruption of DNA synthesis. Side effects of isoniazid include: Peripheral neuritis due to interference with the production of active coenzyme pyridoxa phosphate from pyridoxine. Therefore, pyridoxine 10mg/day (vitamin B6) is given prophylactically along with isoniazid to prevent neurotoxicity. Hepatitis - isoniazid must be stopped at the first sign of hepatotoxicity. Rashes Anaemia Arthralgia Toxicity of isoniazid results in metabolic acidosis, seizures, and coma. Other options: Option B: Rifampin acts by binding to DNA-dependent RNA polymerase to form a stable drug-enzyme complex. This complex suppresses RNA synthesis. Side effects of rifampin are hepatitis, flu-like illness, orange-red colored urine, and body secretions. Option C: Pyrazinamide is a prodrug, it is converted into an active metabolite pyrazinoic acid which makes the intracellular environment acidic and collapses the transmembrane proton motive force, thereby killing the bacteria.

This results in disruption in mycobacterial cell wall synthesis. Optic neuritis is an important side effect of ethambutol.

Slow acetylators (group A) of isoniazid are prone to develop peripheral neuropathy. The rate of metabolism of isoniazid is determined by the genetic polymorphism of NAT2 enzyme and classified broadly into two groups - slow and fast acetylators. In slow acetylators, the drug accumulates due to slow metabolism resulting in an increased risk of side effects, and hence they should undergo periodic monitoring. Peripheral neuropathy is a more frequent side effect of INH when compared to hepatotoxicity. Fast acetylators metabolize the drug rapidly and show less response to standard doses and the therapy may be less effective.",

Bedaquiline is contraindicated in the age group of <18 years.",

        "explanation": "Delamanid acts by inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis. Pretomanid and delamanid are bicyclic nitroimidazoles that act by inhibiting mycolic acid (a component of the mycobacterial cell wall) and protein synthesis in the mycobacteria. Pretomanid in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid was approved by FDA in 2019 for the treatment of adult patients with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB and for patients who are treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive to multidrug-resistant pulmonary (MDR) TB treatment. In India, delamanid is only approved for the management of MDR-TB. Isoniazid also acts by inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis. Other options: Option A: Bedaquiline acts by inhibition of ATP synthase. It is a diarylquinoline that targets the subunit c of the ATP synthase of M. tuberculosis. This leads to inhibition of the proton pump activity of the ATP synthase and causes a failure in the bacillary energy metabolism. Option C: Fluoroquinolones act by inhibition of DNA gyrase. They are used as second-line agents in the treatment of tuberculosis. Option D: Cycloserine is a D-alanine analogue used as a second-line drug for MDR-TB that acts by inhibition of alanine racemase. Alanine racemase converts •-alanine to D-alanine which is needed for the mycobacterial cell wall.",

It is a normal, protective downregulation of thyroid hormone synthesis and release via transient inhibition of iodide organification in the presence of an iodine load (exogenous supplementation, iodinated contrast dye, drugs like amiodarone). This occurs in the thyroid gland which is under pituitary control. With persistent high iodine load, an escape phenomenon occurs in normal individuals after around 10 days as the iodide levels fall inside the follicle. In autoimmune diseases (Hashimoto’s or Grave’s), however, the suppression may persist. The Jod-Basedow phenomenon is iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. It is also seen after an iodine load. However, it is seen in thyroid glands where autoregulation and pituitary control have failed. When exposed to an iodine load in excess, instead of blocking the organification process, the thyroid gland (areas of the autonomously functioning gland) continues to uptake the iodine, producing more thyroid hormone independent of normal regulatory mechanisms. It is seen in endemic goiter, toxic multinodular goiter, thyroid adenoma, and sometimes in Grave’s disease.",

Cortisol is active and can bind to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoid receptors whereas cortisone is inactive and does not bind to either. The selective inactivation of cortisol is required in certain sites such as the distal nephron so that the specific autoregulatory responses to aldosterone can be achieved. Therefore, cortisol (active) is metabolized to cortisone (inactive) by 11-beta-HSD2 in the kidney, so as to protect renal mineralocorticoid receptors from cortisol binding. Some tissues, like the liver, can convert inactive cortisone back to active cortisol through an enzyme called 11-beta-HSD1 (\"B\" in the image). This completes the “cortisone–cortisol shuttle” because the kidney can inactivate cortisol where it is not needed and the liver can reactivate it afterward. However, when circulating cortisol levels are very high, as in severe Cushing syndrome, they can overwhelm this protective mechanism, allowing cortisol to bind to and activate the mineralocorticoid receptor. This leads to volume expansion, hypertension, and hypokalemia often observed in hypercortisolism. A mutation of 11-beta-HSD2 also causes a similar clinical picture and is the reason for the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess. 17-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase are involved in the metabolism of sex steroids.",

Endogenous insulin is initially synthesized as preproinsulin that is processed to proinsulin inside beta cells. Proinsulin is released by secretory granules after processing it to form insulin and C-peptide. Synthetic insulin usually lacks C-peptide, so in factitious hypoglycemia secondary to exogenous insulin administration, plasma insulin will be elevated, but there will be suppression of C-peptide and proinsulin, and insulin to C-peptide ratio will be greater than one. On the other hand, insulinomas and insulin secretagogues like sulfonylureas stimulate endogenous insulin production. As a result, plasma insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin levels will be all elevated. The only way to differentiate between insulinoma and insulin secretagogues-induced hypoglycemia is by detecting the drug, e.g., sulfonylurea, in the blood or urine. C-peptide has no known physiological function or receptor. It has a half-life of about 30 min.",

Potassium loss is caused by an extracellular shift of potassium (in exchange with hydrogen ions) due to acidosis. Much of the shifted extracellular potassium is lost due to emesis and osmotic diuresis. When insulin therapy is initiated for DKA, the serum K+ is shifted intracellularly. Dangerous hypokalemia might occur if K+ supplementation is not initiated subsequently. Insulin should be withheld if the serum level of potassium is below 3.3 mmol/L.",

Flutamide is a non-steroidal antiandrogen that competes with androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone for binding to the androgen receptors in the prostate gland. By doing so, it prevents them from stimulating the prostate cancer cells to grow. In addition to its use in prostate cancer, flutamide has been used to treat hyperandrogenism (excess androgen levels) in women, such as in those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and Hirsutism. Other anti-androgens are: Bicalutamide, apalutamide, and nilutamide Spironolactone (aldosterone antagonist with antiandrogen activity) Cyproterone acetate (progestin with antiandrogen activity) Cimetidine (H2 blocker with anti-androgen activity) Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are a class of androgen receptor ligands that have similar anabolic properties to anabolic steroids, but with reduced androgenic side effects.

N-acetylcysteine is considered as a definitive antidote for acetaminophen poisoning to prevent hepatic injury. N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) is a toxic metabolite of acetaminophen which causes hepatotoxicity. In adults, hepatotoxicity may occur after ingestion of a single dose of 10–15 g (150–250 mg/kg) of acetaminophen; doses of 20–25 g or more are potentially fatal. In acetaminophen poisoning, due to increased NAPQI, there is utilization of glutathione (GSH). This in turn leads to depletion of GSH leading to oxidative cellular damage of the hepatocytes. N-acetylcysteine replenishes GSH stores and also conjugates with NAPQI and prevents oxidative damage to the cell. It also protects against extrahepatic injury due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Option A: Flumazenil is an antidote for benzodiazepine toxicity.

The pathology of migraine is not completely understood but it includes activation of trigeminal ganglion nociceptive neurons and the subsequent release of CGRP from fibers associated with meningeal vessels. This is believed to mediate vasodilation and mast cell degranulation. Thus, CGRP is involved in the development and maintenance of persistent pain, central sensitization and allodynia, which are events characteristic of migraine pathology. Blockage of CGRP receptors by CGRP receptor antagonists, causes inhibition of the inflammatory and nociceptive effects of CGRP at multiple sites within the peripheral and central nervous systems that are implicated in the underlying pathology of migraine. Monoclonal antibodies that directly inhibit CGRP have also been developed. These include: Fremanezumab Galcanezumab Note: The FDA has recently approved Atogepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults.

Heparin resistance refers to failure to achieve a therapeutic aPTT with daily doses of heparin of 35,000 units or more. In true heparin resistance, there is an actual blunting of heparin’s anticoagulant effect. This occurs due to: Low ATIII levels (most common cause) Increased heparin-binding plasma proteins (acute phase reactants) Increased heparin clearance (e.g. due to splenomegaly in liver disease) Low ATIII levels could be due to decreased synthesis (hereditary, hepatic failure), increased consumption (DIC, MAHA, or in a bypass circuit) or increased loss (nephrotic syndrome). The dose of heparin has to be increased to achieve therapeutic aPTT. Severe antithrombin deficiency may require antithrombin concentrate as well.",

Due to the variable sensitivity of thromboplastin, the International normalized ratio (INR) was developed to standardize the reporting of prothrombin time. In INR, the patient’s prothrombin time is divided by mean normal prothrombin time and this ratio is multiplied by the International Sensitivity Index (ISI) of the particular thromboplastin reagent.

        "explanation": "The given image is of a spacer device. It decreases the incidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis and other propellant-mediated oropharyngeal adverse effects like dysphonia that occur with the use of a pMDI. Spacers reduce the velocity and size of particles entering the upper airways. This reduces the amount of drug that impinges on the oropharynx and increases the proportion of drug inhaled into lower airways. The systemic absorption is unchanged by the use of a spacer. Spacer devices are useful in delivering inhaled drugs to children who are not able to use a pMDI alone but can also be used by adults for better drug delivery. The image below shows the use of a spacer device with a face mask which is preferred in children younger than 3 years of age. The various devices used for the delivery of inhalational drugs are: Pressurized metered-dose inhalers - Drugs are propelled from a canister in the pMDI with the aid of a propellant. These devices are convenient, portable, and typically deliver 50–200 doses of a drug Dry powder inhalers - these devices scatter the drug into a fine powder that is dispersed by air turbulence on inhalation. DPIs have been developed to deliver drugs such as insulin, but the dosing is inconsistent. Children <7 years find it difficult to use a DPI. Nebulizers: Two types of nebulizer are available - Jet nebulizers that are driven by a stream of gas (air or oxygen) Ultrasonic nebulizers that use a rapidly vibrating piezoelectric crystal and thus do not require a source of compressed gas. The nebulizers deliver much higher drug doses as compared pMDIs. These are useful in: Treating acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD Extreme airway obstruction (severe COPD) Delivering inhaled drugs to infants and small children who cannot use the other inhalation devices Administering drugs such as antibiotics in relatively high doses",

It is widely used in the treatment of metastatic or unresectable melanoma. It can be used as a single agent but it is more effective when used with BRAF inhibitors like dabrafenib. Adverse effects of this drug include rash, diarrhea, increased ALT, abdominal pain, stomatitis, increased AST, anemia, etc. Dabrafenib and vemurafenib are BRAF inhibitors used in metastatic melanoma. Ipilimumab is a human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blocking antibody used in metastatic or unresectable melanoma. Recent update: The FDA has approved the combination of the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib and the MEK inhibitor binimetinib for the treatment of patients with BRAF-mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma.",

It is indicated for advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients with >20% of T cells expressing the surface marker CD25. After binding to the IL-2 receptors, it is internalized by endocytosis. The active fragment of diphtheria toxin then is released into the cytosol, where it inhibits protein synthesis through ADP ribosylation, leading to cell death. Immunotoxins are proteins that contain a toxin along with an antibody that binds specifically to target cells. Antibody-drug conjugates are complex molecules composed of an antibody linked to a biologically active cytotoxic (anticancer) drug. These antibody-targeted drug therapies are cell-specific to kill efficiently the target cells that bind and internalize the drug conjugate. Examples are: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin - Monoclonal antibody against CD33 linked to a semisyntheti derivative of calicheamicin, a potent antitumor antibiotic. It was approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Brentuximab vedotin - Anti-CD30 IgG1 monoclonal antibody linked with the microtubule-disrupting agent MMAE. It is used for the treatment of Hodgkin and anaplasti lymphoma. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine - It combines the HER2-targeted properties of trastuzumab with the antimicrotubule agent DM1 (derived from maytansine), allowing preferential intracellular drug delivery to HER2+ cells. It is used in the treatment of HER+ breast cancer.",
