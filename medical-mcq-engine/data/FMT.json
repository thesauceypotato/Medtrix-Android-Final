The relationship between the chronological age and dental age is stronger than between chronological age and skeletal age. Two aspects of tooth development have been used in the estimation of dental age: The emergence of teeth - superior part of the crown of the tooth appearing level with the surface of the alveolar bone The stage of mineralization of crowns and roots during development Estimation of dental age using mineralization stages of crowns and roots of developing teeth includes visualization from a radiographic image. This helps in viewing both erupted and unerupted teeth. It is a more accurate method of estimating age than emergence, because emergence is an event whose exact time of occurrence is not accurately known. The study of dental microstructure is the most accurate method of age determination in childhood. This involves counting perikymata (incremental lines on the surface of tooth enamel). Note: Eruption is a continuous process by which a tooth moves from its crypt in the jaw bone to its position of occlusion in the mouth. It is different from emergence. Emergence denotes that a tooth has pierced the gingiva.",

After the age of 5 years, the fusion of epiphyses acts as a calendar up to the age of 25. The analysis of the hand and the wrist is the recommended method for living age diagnostics. But, this technique frequently does not provide sufficient evidence to place an individual older than or younger than key threshold ages - 16, 18 or 21.

Physical anthropology has established several methods for determining age in adults which include macroscopic, microscopic, and biomolecular methods. Macroscopic methods of adult age determination are the most important ones and consist principally in the degree of degeneration of selected articulations such as: Pubic symphysis Osteochondral surface of the 4th rib Auricular surface of the ilium Suchey and Brooks described six phases of degenerative change in the pubic symphysis. Until recently, the most commonly used method for estimating age using the architecture of the pubic symphysis was that of Todd, who described 10 stages of pubic symphysis change during aging. More recently, researchers Suchey and Brooks described six phases of degenerative change in the pubic symphysis. To solve this controversy, the following is suggested: A two-step procedure has been developed for estimating age: If by looking at the skeleton, the age of the individual seems to be within the first 3 phases of the Suchey–Brookes pubic symphysis method, then this should be the method of choice. If the subject is classified in the last 3 phases, then one should switch to the Lamendin technique in order to assess age more accurately. Currently, age diagnosis at over 60 remains a problem. In early adulthood, Suchey-Brookes pubic symphysis method is most accurate. In late adulthood, Lamendin technique of dental age estimation is most accurate.",

These are then enlarged to exactly the same dimensions as the photograph, and either the negative or a positive print is made on transparent film. This is then laid over the photograph and adjusted in an attempt to match up the major anatomical landmarks such as: Nasion Supraorbital ridges Angle of the jaw Nasal aperture External auditory meatus Teet The test is mainly an exclusory one i.e. if the match cannot be made, then the skull is not that of the person in the photograph. If the match is good or excellent, then it may or may not be the same person. Race, Sex and Stature Determination",

Dereliction - The physician must maintain the standard of a 'prudent physician' under similar circumstances. If the physician fails to maintain the standard of care, it is called dereliction. Direct causation - The negligent act or omission must directly cause the injury without any intervening cause. Damage - The negligent act must cause damage of a type that would have been foreseen by a reasonable physician. Death and Post-Mortem Changes",

        "correct_option": "c",
        "explanation": "Victims of smoke inhalation are affected by carbon monoxide poisoning. In carbon monoxide poisoning, the cause of death is anemic hypoxia. Carbon monoxide has a higher affinity to hemoglobin compared to oxygen and hence the amount of hemoglobin available for oxygen transport is markedly reduced. It displaces oxygen from its combination with hemoglobin and forms a relatively stable compound known as carboxyhemoglobin. It thus reduces the oxygen content of the blood, and hence, that of the tissues. It acts as a chemical asphyxiant and produces death due to anemic anoxia. It is important to note that in the case of anemic hypoxia, O2 content is low but dissolved O2 is within normal limits so it does not stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors. Note: Carbon monoxide poisoning causes both anemic (due to CO-Hb) and histotoxic (due to inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase) hypoxia. But the main cause of death is due to anemic hypoxia. Option A - Histotoxic hypoxia- The most common example is cyanide poisoning. Cyanide inhibits important enzymes in the oxidative phosphorylation process, which is essential to the survival of our cells. Additional oxygen supplementation will not be able to overcome this inhibition, so it will have limited benefit. Hyperbaric oxygen may be helpful to some extent. Option B - Stagnant hypoxia refers to ischemic hypoxia that results from inadequate circulation due to conditions such as heart failure and hypoxia in the setting of shock. In such conditions, administering intravenous fluids can improve the patient's condition because it is the circulation that is affected. If the shock is prolonged it can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can be treated with positive pressure ventilation and not simply by increasing oxygen administration.",

These soaps are acidic, which prevents the growth of putrefactive bacteria. Adipocere has a distinct offensive or sweetish smell, but during the early stages of its production, a penetrating ammoniacal odor is also noticed.

In strangulation, hanging, and any condition where the larynx might be damaged, a modified Y-shaped incision is to be preferred. This incision is used because the skin of the upper neck can then be dissected off the mandible and raised to give a wide approach to the neck structures. Given below are types of incisions done for an autopsy: Y-Shaped Incision: Commences at the acromial process on the shoulder on either side. It runs downwards and anteriorly beneath the breasts as to meet at the xiphisternum in the midline. It then runs downwards as in an I-shaped incision to the symphysis pubis. It is preferred in females. It is more cosmetically accepted as the incision and the stitches are minimally seen after the autopsy. Modified Y-shaped incision: Commences at the angle of mandible on either side, brought forwards and downwards to meet at the suprasternal notch. It is then run downwards as a midline incision up to the pubic symphysis. Indicated in cases of strangulation or death due to compression of the neck. I-Shaped Incision: Extends from symphysis mentii to symphysis pubis taking curve towards left around the umbilicus. It is used routinely in practice. It is simple and convenient. Elongated X-shaped Incision: This is a special incision used to dissect out subcutaneous structures in the back to identify and evaluate the extent of blunt injuries, which are usually missed where superficial imprints are faint, particularly when present on skin not overlying bone. This is helpful in the reconstruction of events prior to death and should be practiced in cases of custodial death. Inverted Y-shaped incision is used in infants.",

If they float, make a small cut while underwater to see air bubbles coming up. A floating viscera giving out air bubbles when opened underwater is a positive test. Interpretation: A positive test proves live birth even in the absence of a positive hydrostatic lung test. This may happen if there had been some obstruction in the respiratory passages. A negative test does not mean stillbirth since air does not necessarily enter the stomach in adequate amounts during the breathing act. Putrefaction invalidates the result.

This is because such wounds tend to gape more, giving a false interpretation of the weapon. Option A: The taper of the blade is related to wound size. The length of the wound would be equal to the width of the blade at the point to which it was inserted. Thus the length of the wound varies according to the depth to which it was inserted. Once the blade edges become parallel, the wound size remains constant for further penetration of the knife. Option B: If a knife is driven up to the hilt, the depth of the wound as measured at autopsy may be greater than the true length of the blade. This is usually seen in the abdomen, and to a lesser extent in the chest. A forceful stab can cause the abdominal or chest wall to indent, allowing the knife tip to reach tissues that would normally be beyond its reach.

As the contents of the skull are virtually incompressible, there must consequently be a compensatory distortion or bulging of other areas. This is the struck hoop analogy. Both these intruded and extruded areas can be the site of fracturing if the distortion of the bone exceeds the limits of its elasticity. The inner table will fracture where the skull is indented and the outer table will fracture at the margins of the deformed area. The following images show the mechanism of skull fracture. Option A: Trauma most commonly causes subarachnoid hemorrhage, not subdural hemorrhage. Option B: Fractures lines of the skull do not cross each other. This forms the basis for Puppe's rule.

It occurs due to the rupture of small vessels and is seen in a fern-like pattern or the branching of a tree. Option B: When the skin is in firm contact with an electrical conductor, splitting of the layers of the epidermis or those of the epidermal-dermal junction. This may in turn produce a raised blister known as a Joule burn. The image below shows a Joule burn: Option C: When the contact is less firm, an air gap is formed between the skin and the conductor. Thus the current traverses the gap as a spark. This leads to a distinct hard brownish keratin nodule raised above the surrounding surface known as a spark lesion. Option A: Crocodile skin effect is caused by high-tension current burns, where the voltage is in the multi-kilovolt range, sparking may occur over many centimeters.

When the contact is less firm, an air gap (albeit narrow) exists between skin and conductor the current jumps the gap as a spark. This causes the outer skin keratin to melt over a small area. On cooling, the keratin fuses into a hard brownish nodule, usually raised above the surrounding surface. Various skin lesions in electrical injury: When the skin has been in firm contact with an electrical conductor, this may split the layers of the epidermis or the epidermal-dermal junction and produce a raised blister called Joule burns. In high-voltage burns, such as those sustained from high-tension grid transmission cables, where the voltage is in the multi-kilovolt range, sparking may occur over many centimeters. This can cause multiple spark lesions giving rise to a ‘crocodile-skin’ effect. The heat generated by the current may melt the calcium phosphate, which is radiologically seen as typical round dense foci called as 'bone pearls' or 'wax drippings'.",

This finding is called a grease ring, a ring of dirt or bullet wipe-off. It can be regarded as a reliable sign of entrance. Option A: Inverted edges cannot be regarded as a reliable sign of entry wound. The edges of an entry wound may be everted by the blowback phenomenon in a contact wound. This occurs when the gases strike a bony surface and are reflected back, everting the entry wound edges. Option B: The round shape of entry wounds is unreliable as entry wounds and exit wounds may be of many shapes. This depends on many factors, including the range of firing, angle of firing, presence of subcutaneous bone, etc. Option C: In an abrasion collar the skin immediately around the central hole is discoloured, the so-called ‘abrasion collar’ or ‘contusion ring’. The abrasion ring is primarily due to the massive overstretching and subsequent drying-up of the skin adjacent to the area of projectile impact. It cannot be taken as a reliable sign of entry wound as an exit wound may have a spurious abrasion collar.

To ensure transfer of energy to the tissues, some missiles are especially designed or modified to slow up or stop within the body. Softheaded bullets will flatten on impact and some are designed to fragment. The dumdum bullet fragments upon striking and transfers more energy for tissue displacement and disruption. Explosive-tipped bullets, cause fire in the target due to the presence of explosives at the tip. They are designed to deform the missile to cause maximum deceleration.

A blast causes the most damage at an interface between tissues in contact with the atmosphere, which is why the lung usually suffers the most severe damage. However the most commonly affected structure in air blasts is the tympanic membrane. The gastrointestinal system suffers from the effect of a blast because, like the lung, it contains air and gases, and is thus not a uniform medium for transit of the shock wave. Victims of explosions in water suffer a reverse order of gastrointestinal to lung damage. Note: In air, the ear, especially the tympanic membrane is severely damaged, however, in a cadaver it is not discernible without an otoscopic examination of the tympanic membrane. Nevertheless, lungs are considered to be the severely damaged organ in the air due to variations in density between the alveolar walls and the contained air.",

It includes: Abrasions Bruises/contusions Puncture lacerations Blast injuries are classified as: Primary injuries: Effect of transmitted blast waves on gas-containing structures. The external injuries are absent and are characterized by internal injuries. The middle, ear, lungs, an gastrointestinal tract are the most susceptible to this. Secondary injuries: Injuries caused by shrapnel and other airborne debris propelled by the explosion. These injuries may affect any part of the body and sometimes result in penetrating trauma. Most casualties are caused by secondary injuries. Tertiary injuries: These are caused by blast wind that can throw victims against solid objects. Quaternary injuries: All other injuries caused by explosions are not included in the above three categories. eg, flash burns, crush injuries, respiratory effects due to toxic dust, gas, etc. Option B: Blast of air or blast wave cause primary injuries which involve internal organs without external injury. Option C: Explosion burns: When the bomb explodes, the temperature of the explosive gases can exceed 2000°C, and the heat radiated momentarily can cause flash burns. It is a quaternary type of blast injury. Option D: Building collapse can cause crush injuries which is a quaternary blast injury. Mechanical Asphyxia",

If there is no haemorrhage, the fracture must be post mortem. If there is a small bleed, then the lesion can be either antemortem or post-mortem. Large bleeds definitely indicate an antemortem fracture. Damage to the laryngeal cartilages is much less common in ligature strangulation than in manual strangulation.",

The normal movements of the chest wall are prevented. There is a gross compression of the chest and usually abdomen by a powerful force, due to which chest expansion and diaphragmatic lowering are prevented. For example stampede deaths, crushing by falls of the earth in coal mines, or earthquakes. Option D: Overlaying or compression suffocation results due to compression of the chest, so as to prevent breathing. It occurs when an intoxicated parent or other person shares a bed with an infant.

Waterlogging of the lung - frothy fluid will exude from the bronchi when the lung is squeezed and from the cut surfaces when they are sectioned with a knife. But, the absence of waterlogging by no means excludes true drowning (e.g. dry drowning).

        "correct_option": "c",
        "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of immersion syndrome/ hydrocution/ submersion inhibition. Death results from cardiac arrest due to vasovagal inhibition followed by cardiac arrest. Vagal stimulation occurs due to: Stimulation of nerve endings of the surface of the body by cold water Falling or diving into the water in a manner so that it suddenly strikes the abdomen, especiall the epigastric region. Stimulation of the nerve endings of the mucosa by the entry of cold water into the eardrums, nasal passages, the pharynx, and the larynx. The mechanism involved in immersion syndrome: Diving/falling into the water, feet-first Inexperienced \"duck-diving\" Diving/falling into the water with a horizontal entr People under the influence of alcohol are more likely affected due to the general vasodilation of skin vessels, consequently amplifying the effects of vasovagal inhibition. These effects are increased in people who are attempting suicide/anxious as they have a more active reflex arc. Option A: Cerebral edema is seen in cases of near-drowning. It is a type of atypical drowning and is also known as post-immersion syndrome or secondary drowning. This type is necessitated by the survival of the drowning victim beyond 24 hours of a submersion episode. Death is due to respiratory decompensation suffered despite responding well to initial resuscitation measures. Mechanisms of death involve hypoxemia which results in sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, pulmonary edema, and cerebral edema. Option B: Pulmonary edema and cardiac arrest are the cause of death in typical drowning/primary drowning due to inhalation of water into the lungs. There are varying mechanisms for freshwater and saltwater drowning leading to either ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest respectively. Both types of typical drowning have terminal pulmonary edema and heart failure as mechanisms of death. Option D: In dry drowning death is due to the development of laryngeal spasm and subsequent airway closure. Thick mucus, foam, and froth may develop, producing a plug.",

        "explanation": "Freshwater drowning (drowning in a lake) is associated with both hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. When freshwater (hypotonic to plasma) enters the alveolar spaces, it is rapidly absorbed into the pulmonary circulation resulting in gross local hemodilution. This massive increase in blood volume leads to hemolysis with the liberation of potassium. This causes hyperkalemia with corresponding hyponatremia. When seawater enters, due to high saline content, reverse osmotic flow occurs. The fluid leaves the circulation and enters the alveolar spaces. This causes hemoconcentration, hypernatremia and pulmonary edema.",

The signs of immersion are: Maceration of skin/ washerwoman's skin - It begins within minutes in warm water and takes longer in cold water. It refers to the wrinkled, pale, and soaked appearance of the skin when immersed in water. This first appears on areas with an appreciable keratin layer such as the fingertips palms, backs of the hands, and later the soles. The first site affected is the fingerpads. It affects the hands earlier than the feet. The image given below shows skin maceration. Cutis anserina - 'goose-flesh' or piloerection: This is usually found in cold water. The image given below shows cutis anserina. Post-mortem hypostasis - If the water is still, the postmortem hypostasis affects the heads and the limbs. This is because the chest and abdomen float higher because of the lungs and the abdominal gases. Foreign bodies in respiratory passages and stomach - Sand may be found deep in the respiratory passages and stomach, especially if the body has been rolled by the waves on a beach. This is not evidence of live aspiration. The signs of immersion just indicate that the body was immersed in water. They are not evidence of death from drowning. In temperate climates, the following is an approximate guide to estimate the duration of immersion: Finding Time since immersio n No wrinkling of finger pads Less than a few hour s Wrinkled fingers, palms, and feet Few hours to 3 days Early decomposition (Head a nd abdomen) 4-10 days Marbling of veins, peeling of the epidermis 2-4 weeks Muscle loss with bone exposu re 1-2 months",

Superfecundation is the fertilization of 2 different ova in the same menstrual cycle (as suggested by the same gestational age) by separate acts of coitus. It can occur even after artificial reproductive therapy. Hence, after embryo transfer, intercourse must be avoided. Heteropaternal superfecundation is used to refer to instances of two different males fathering fraternal twins. This leads to the possibility of twins also being half-siblings. This may give rise to the doubt of adultery and infidelity. Option A: Superfetation is the fertilization of 2 different ova released in different menstrual cycles (i.e ovulation and fertilization during pregnancy). This can occur within 12 weeks of pregnancy after which the decidual space is obliterated and a detailed evaluation will reveal disparities in gestational ages. Option C: Supposititious child is also known as a fictitious child. In such cases, a woman pretends to be pregnant and generally substitutes a male child for a female child born of her, or after an abortion. This is done for the purpose of claiming property.

Adipocere is the formation of a soft greyish-white, waxy, greasy material with an offensive, sweet rancid smell, occurring in fatty tissues. It is due to postmortem hydrolysis or hydrogenation of the fats. It is a modification of putrefaction. It is seen most commonly in bodies immersed in water or in a damp, warm environment. Fetuses under 7 months do not show this change. If the pregnancy with the dead fetus continues, it may be gradually resorbed or mummified. Mummification occurs when the foetus dies from a deficient supply of blood, when liquor amnii is scanty, and when no air enters the uterus. It is also a finding in fetus papyraceous, which is the intrauterine demise of a fetal twin, where it is compressed between the membranes and the uterine wall. The most important post-mortem change in an intrauterine death is maceration, which is an autolytic process by which there is self-disintegration of the body by cellular enzymes.

        "explanation": "Sleeping on hard/ firm surfaces is not associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Crowded sleeping areas with many pillows, blankets, and stuffed toys, or old, soft mattresses are associated with an increased risk of SIDS. SIDS is also known as a 'cot' or 'crib' death. Usually, the parent finds the infant expired in the crib after putting them to sleep. It is an unexpected death in a healthy infant, whose autopsy may not reveal a cause of death. 70% of cases of SIDS are found at autopsy to have intrathoracic petechiae in the pleura, epicardium, and thymus. However, this feature is considered to be an agonal phenomenon. The presence of this feature alone should not raise concern for manual suffocation. Most cases of SIDS occur between 1-7 months of age but can occur up to 2 years. The risk increases with male infants, multiple births, colder climates, and lower socioeconomic status families. Ways to reduce the risk of SIDS include: Avoiding sharing a bed with the infant Abstinence from smoking Using hard/firm bedding and keeping the sleeping area clear Ensuring the infant sleeps supine Keeping the room temperature comfortable Breastfeeding Option A: Sharing a bed with a family member is associated with SIDS.

Pralidoxime (2-PAM) and other oximes, such as HI-6 and obidoxime, are cholinesterase-reactivating agents. Hence, its coadministration with atropine is effective in treating both muscarinic and nicotinic symptoms. Pralidoxime reactivates the acetylcholinesterase, which had been deactivated in organophosphate poisoning. Pralidoxime attaches to the anionic site of the enzyme that remains unoccupied. Then it reacts with the phosphorus atom of the organophosphorous compound which is attached to the esteric site to form a phospho-oxime complex. It then dissociates from the enzyme, regenerating the active enzyme. Pralidoxime should not be administered without concurrent atropine, in order to prevent worsening of symptoms due to transient oxime-induced acetylcholinesterase inhibition.

Option C: Carbamates do not effectively penetrate the CNS in adults. Hence, there is less CNS toxicity.

The venom is a potent autonomic stimulator, resulting in the release of massive amounts of catecholamines from the adrenals. If the scorpion has hemolytic venom, the reaction is mainly local and simulates the viper snake bite. The scorpion sting will have only one hole in the center of the reddened area. The extremity will have edema, pain, and reddening. This usually lasts for one to two hours. The symptoms produced by a neurotoxic venom are similar to a cobra bite. There is usually no marked reaction in the local area. Nausea, vomiting, extreme restlessness, fever, various types of paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, convulsions, coma, respiratory depression, and death may occur within hours from pulmonary edema or cardiac failure.
