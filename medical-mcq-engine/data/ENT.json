The aural toilet can be done by dry mopping, suction clearance, or irrigating the canal with warm, sterile normal saline. Further treatment modalities: After the aural toilet is done, wicks medicated with antibiotic-steroid preparation can be used. These wicks have to be changed daily for 2 to 3 days, which thereafter can be substituted by ear drops. Broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics are used when there is cellulitis and acute tender ymphadenitis. Analgesics are usually a part of management, as otitis externa is associated with severe pain.

Ideal candidates have no functional hearing and have failed more conservative treatments, such as gentamicin injection. Despite this morbidity, labyrinthectomy has the highest rate of vertigo control (>95%), more than vestibular neurectomy (78-90%), and is considered the single definitive treatment. The step-by-step management approach for Ménière's disease consists of dietary modifications and vestibular suppressants as the initial measures, followed by intratympanic gentamicin ablation, and finally, surgical intervention. Primarily, the management of Menier's disease involves a sodium restricted diet and diuretics like acetazolamide (Option A). They are more useful for short-term control. Gentamicin (Option D) is a selective vestibulotoxic aminoglycoside antibiotic that is preferentially taken up by type I hair cells. It is opted for only if dietary modifications and vestibular suppressants have failed to control the symptoms. If used judiciously, hearing is preserved. The options for surgical management include - Endolymphatic sac surgery, vestibular neurectomy, and labyrinthectomy. Endolymphatic sac surgery is currently declining in popularity due to lack of evidence of vertigo control. Vestibular neurectomy (Option C) refers to selective ablation of the vestibular nerve. Even though it is considered a hearing sparing surgery and carries comparable rates of vertigo control as labyrinthectomy, it is an intradural procedure and carries a greater risk of complications. Hearing loss will still progress as it would have in the natural course of illness.",

        "correct_option": "c",
        "explanation": "Sensorineural hearing loss is not seen in superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome (SSCDS). They may experience mild to moderate hearing conductive loss. Conductive hearing loss is due to the abnormal transmission and dissipation of acoustic energy through the defect (third window), leading to reduced conduction to the cochlea for lower frequencies. This can manifest as a low-frequency air-bone gap at multiple frequencies. There is no defect in the cochlea or the auditory pathway. Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) is a condition in which bone between the apex of the superior semicircular canal and the middle cranial fossa is absent. This causes endolymph in the labyrinthine system to move with sound or pressure, causing an activation of the vestibular system. Patients may have vestibular symptoms like vertigo triggered by loud sounds (Tullio phenomenon)or pressure such as coughing and can also experience hyperacusis for bone-conducted sounds. They may perceive the sounds of their own eye movements or footsteps in the affected ear. The patients may exhibit nystagmus when exposed to loud sounds or during the Valsalva maneuver or pressure in the ear canal (positive fistula test). The direction of the nystagmus aligns with the affected superior semicircular canal, and some patients may tilt their heads in the plane of the affected superior semicircular canal in response to loud sounds. Noncontrast HRCT of the temporal bone can demonstrate the defect. The click-evoked VEMP (vestibular evoked myogenic potential) response and vestibuloocular reflex are pronounced in SSCD patients, in which the evoked eye movements align with the affected superior canal. For mild symptoms, avoidance of triggers is recommended. In case of severe disabling symptoms, surgical resurfacing of the superior semicircular canal or plugging of the superior semicircular canal may be attempted.",

Sebaceous cysts are the retention cysts of the sebaceous gland that are usually present on the face, scalp, or scrotum. They contain yellowish-white cheesy material with fat and epithelium. Clinical features: The swelling is painless, soft, and freely mobile. Though non-transilluminating, they are Paget's test positive (fluctuant). Punctum is seen in 70% of the patients with sebaceous cysts. They are dark in color due to the accumulation of denuded epithelium. They also have an unpleasant sebum odor. The swelling can ulcerate and become painful (Cock’s peculiar tumor). Some cysts over the scalp may also harden over time (Sebaceous horn). Many may get infected and lead to abscess formation. Treatment: Excision including skin adjacent to punctum using elliptical incision-dissection method. Incision and avulsion of cyst wall. In the presence of an abscess, an initial treatment with an incision later followed by excision of the cyst Other options: Option A: Dermoid cysts present as firm painless subcutaneous nodules and are of 4 types: Sequestration dermoid - sequestration of epithelium during embryological development Tubulodermoid - accumulation of secretions from ectodermal tube/duct Implantation dermoid - implantation of the epidermis due to trauma Teratomatous dermoid - having all 3 germ layers (ecto, meso, and endoderm) Option C: Meningiomas are benign tumors arising from the meningothelial cells of the dura. They present with headaches, seizures, or focal neurological deficits. Option D: Postauricular cutaneous mastoid fistula is a rare complication of chronic otitis media that heals very slowly and needs surgical closure.",

Rinne’s test is a tuning fork test performed commonly with tuning forks of frequencies such as 128, 256, 512, and 1024 Hz. Rinne’s test is done by placing a vibrating tuning fork on the patient’s mastoid and when he stops hearing, it is brought beside the external auditory meatus (EAC). If he still hears the sound, air conduction (AC) is better than bone conduction (BC) i.e. AC>BC. The inferences are as follows: Rinne's test is considered positive (normal) when the air conduction AC>BC is seen in norma people and people with sensorineural deafness. It is considered negative when the BC>AC, and is seen in patients with conductive deafness. As a general prediction, a negative Rinne's test with any tuning fork frequency suggests a minimum hearing loss of at least 15 - 20 dB.The table below indicates a rough minimum air-bone gap for negative Rinne's test at different frequencies: A prediction of the air-bone gap can be made based on the combination of tuning fork tests of 256, 512, and 1024 Hz: A Rinne test negative for 256 Hz but positive for 512 Hz indicates an air-bone gap of 20-30 dB. A Rinne test negative for 256 and 512 Hz but positive for 1024 Hz indicates an air-bone gap of 30-45 dB. A Rinne test negative for 256, 512, and 1024 Hz indicates an air-bone gap of 45-60 dB.

        "explanation": "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) damages the outer hair cells, starting in the basal turn of the cochlea. Outer hair cells are affected before the inner hair cells. NIHL occurs after chronic exposure to less intense sounds. The damage caused by noise trauma depends on the frequency of noise (frequency of 2000 to 3000 Hz causes more damage) intensity, duration of the noise, and preexisting ear disease. The audiogram in noise-induced hearing loss shows a typical notch at 4000Hz both for air and bone conduction known as acoustic dip/boiler's notch. Patients at this stage complain of high-pitched tinnitus and difficulty hearing in noisy surroundings. Pre-employment and annual audiograms for persons working at places where noise is above 85 dB (A) help in the early detection of NIHL. The human ear can hear frequencies from about 20 to 20,000 Hz. Below 20 Hz, the vibrations are infra-audible, and above 20,000 Hz, they are ultra-sonic. Pure tone audiometry can detect only up to 8000 Hz. Extended high-frequency audiometry is recommended for early detection of hearing loss, as it can identify hearing impairments before the frequencies necessary for speech comprehension are affected. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions is a more sensitive tool than conventional audiometry, particularly in children under 5 years old for early detection of hearing loss. A noise of ˜0 dB(A) SPL (acceptable noise levels, sound pressure level), 8 hours a day for 5 days per week is the maximum safe limit as recommended by the Ministry of Labour. As per WHO, 85 dB(A) is considered the highest safe exposure level up to a maximum of 8 hours. The silence zone extends to a distance of 100 meters around the premises of hospitals, nursing homes, educational institutions, and courts. Permissible limits of noise as per the noise pollution (Regulation and Control) rules: Noise levels are measured in dB(A), which prioritizes middle-range frequencies for assessing noise-induced hearing loss while giving less weightage to low and high frequencies.

The audiogram shows conductive deafness along with Carhart's notch (dip in bone conduction at 2000 Hz). These findings are highly suggestive of otosclerosis. Ototoxicity, Meniere’s disease, and noise-induced hearing loss cause sensory neural hearing loss (SNHL) and not conductive hearing loss. Otosclerosis is caused by bony overgrowth involving the enchondral layer of the bony otic capsule. It presents with bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss and tinnitus. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance and can worsen with stress and hormonal changes like during pregnancy and menopause. Stapedial otosclerosis is the most common type of otosclerosis. Here the lesion starts just in front of the oval window in an area called fistula ante fenestrae. The presence of a reddish hue on the promontory through the tympanic membrane, known as the Schwartze sign, suggests an active focus. PTA shows loss of air conduction with air-bone gap, more for lower frequencies and Carhart's notch may be seen. Tympanometry shows an As type of tympanogram in which there is reduced compliance at or near the ambient air pressure. Medical management with sodium fluoride is used in the active stage. Definitive treatment is stapedectomy/stapedotomy with the placement of a prosthesis. Carhart notch usually disappears after a successful stapedectomy. Other options: Option A: Ototoxicity causes SNHL and shows a high-frequency hearing loss in the SNHL curve. Option B: In Meniere's disease, pure tone audiometry shows an SNHL pattern with a rising curve in the early stages (as lower frequencies are involved first) and as the disease progresses higher frequencies are involved, the curve becomes flat or a falling type. Option D: Noise-induced hearing loss is SNHL and PTA shows a characteristic acoustic dip at 4000 Hz both for air and bone conduction.",

So lateral lemniscus is the better option. Current Diagnosis and Treatment in Otorhinolaryngology- auditory brainstem response waves 2, 3, 4, and 5 represent the sequential activation of neurons as the signal is passed up the brainstem from the proximal part of the cochlear nerve, cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex, and lateral lemniscus. NIH Journals- generation of wave V reflects the activity of multiple anatomic auditory structures. A sharp positive peak of wave V arises mainly from the lateral lemniscus, following a slow negative wave represents dendritic potential in the inferior colliculus.",

        "correct_option": "c",
        "explanation": "In caloric testing, cold water irrigation produces horizontal nystagmus towards the opposite side of irrigation. The direction of nystagmus can be remembered by the mnemonic, COWS (cold–opposite, warm–same). The mechanism for the nystagmus is the creation of a temperature gradient by the cold water, which pulls the cupula away from the utricle, causing nystagmus towards the oppsite side. As the horizontal semicircular canal is closer to the outer ear canal, most of the response comes from it and the nystagmus is horizontal. The Fitzgerald–Hallpike test (bithermal caloric test) is done to assess this phenomenon. The patient lies in a supine position with head tilted forward at a 30° angle, ensuring the horizontal canal becomes vertical. Alternatingly, water at temperatures of 30°C and 44°C (7° below and above normal body temperature, respectively) is irrigated into the ears for a duration of 40 seconds each. The examiner closely observes the patient's eyes for the emergence of nystagmus until its endpoint is reached. The time taken from the start of irrigation to the endpoint of nystagmus is recorded and plotted on a calorigram. If no nystagmus is evoked from either ear, the test is repeated with water at a temperature of 20°C for a duration of 4 minutes before labeling the labyrinth dead. A 5-minute interval should be allowed between testing each ear to ensure accurate results.",

By beating of the cilia, the mucus is carried to the nasopharynx to be swallowed. Chemical mechanisms - Immunoglobulins such as IgA, IgE, and Lactoferrin, lysozyme provide innate immunity. Sneezing - It is a protective reflex due to irritation of the nasal mucosa. Temperature regulation and humidification are due to the large surface area of mucosa and highly vascular cavernous spaces.

The patient presents with a foul smell from the nose, marked anosmia (merciful anosmia), and paradoxical nasal obstruction (nasal obstruction despite wide nasal passages). Paradoxical nasal obstruction occurs due to degenerative changes in the sensory nerves of the nasal mucosa, leading to an inability to sense airflow.

It usually follows a blockage of the opening of the crypt in acute follicular tonsillitis. There is marked local pain and dysphagia. Tonsil appears swollen and red. Option B: Tonsilloliths (calculus of the tonsil) are seen in chronic tonsillitis when its crypt is blocked with retention of debris. Inorganic salts of calcium and magnesium are then deposited leading to the formation of a stone. It may gradually enlarge and then ulcerate through the tonsil.

A pre-styloid abscess exhibits distinct features including the prolapse of the tonsil and tonsillar fossa, along with trismus caused by the spasm of the medial pterygoid muscle. Marked odynophagia is common. Additionally, an external swelling can be observed behind the angle of the jaw.

It is the collection of pus in the peritonsillar space between the fibrous capsule of the tonsil and the superior constrictor muscles of the pharynx. Both aerobic and anaerobic organisms are seen. Patient presents with fever, unilateral throat pain, odynophagia, hot potato voice, torticollis, foul breath, referred otalgia through glossopharyngeal nerve and trismus due to spasm of pterygoid muscles. Oral cavity examination may show congested and edematous tonsils, pillars, and soft palate on the involved side. Edematous uvula pushed to the opposite side. Pus may be seen on the tonsillar region. Jugulodigastric lymph nodes may be enlarged. The management of quinsy is by antibiotics and incision and drainage to drain the abscess followed by interval tonsillectomy 4 to 6 weeks later. Rare complications seen are parapharyngeal abscess, edema of the larynx, septicemia, lung abscess, or jugular vein thrombosis. Other options: Option A: Pharyngitis presents with fever, throat pain, enlarged tonsils, and lymphoid follicles on the posterior pharyngeal wall. Option B: Parotid abscess occurs due to the suppuration of parotid space. It presents with swelling, redness, firmness, and tenderness in the parotid area and at the angle of the mandible. It is usually unilateral, but bilateral abscesses can occur. Due to the thick capsule, fluctuation is often difficult to elicit. Option C: Bezold abscess is a complication of acute otomastoiditis where the infection/pus breaks through the thin medial side of the tip of the mastoid and presents as a swelling in the upper part of the neck.",

Patients typically present with unilateral swelling, redness, induration, and tenderness over the parotid gland and angle of the mandible. Dehydration and fever are also present. Diagnosis is by ultrasonography or a CT scan. Multiple small loculi of pus are seen in the parenchyma. Aspiration of abscess can be done to determine the culture and sensitivity of the infective agent. Correction of dehydration, improving oral hygiene and promoting salivary flow. Intravenous antibiotics are also used in treatment. Surgical drainage under local or general anesthesia is carried out by a preauricular incision as employed for parotidectomy. A skin flap is raised to expose the surface of the gland, and the abscess or abscesses are bluntly opened working parallel to the branches of the VIIth nerve.

Biphasic stridor is seen in lesions of glottis, subglottis, and cervical trachea like laryngeal papillomas, vocal cord paralysis, and subglottic stenosis. Stridor is an audible respiratory noise that gets produced by turbulent airflow through an obstructed upper airway. It is an inspiratory sound that may have an expiratory component. It is distinct from stertor which is a snoring-like noise produced from an obstructed nasopharynx or oropharynx. The intensity and pitch of sounds originating from the respiratory system vary based on their site of origin within the respiratory tract and may be heard with or without a stethoscope. Usually, the pitch of the sound increases, and the intensity decreases as one goes lower into the respiratory tract.",

Laryngoscopy shows pinkish to white grape-like projections that can be sessile or pedunculate with a visible central vascular core. The diagnosis is confirmed by direct laryngoscopy and biopsy. Treatment consists of micro-laryngoscopy and CO2 laser excision. The image below depicts laryngeal papillomatosis on laryngoscopy: Reinke's edema (Option A) is a collection of fluid in the subepithelial space of Reinke. It generally occurs in patients with vocal abuse or smoking. The vocal cords will show diffuse, symmetrical swelling. The laryngoscopic image below shows Reinke's edema:",

        "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a child presenting with chronic hoarseness (3 months) of voice and respiratory distress for 2 weeks suggests the diagnosis of respiratory papillomatosis (juvenile papillomatosis). Croup (Option A) and acute epiglottitis (Option D), which cause acute upper respiratory tract obstruction, are ruled out due to the chronic nature of the symptoms. In croup, the upper airway obstruction becomes apparent after 1 to 3 days of low-grade fever, rhinorrhea, and pharyngitis. On the other hand, in epiglottitis, a child experiences respiratory distress within hours of developing a fever. Vocal nodules (Option C) are not typically associated with respiratory distress. Respiratory papillomatosis is the most common respiratory tract neoplasm in children. They are simple warts (benign tumors) caused by human papillomavirus types 6 and 11 commonly seen in children aged 3 to 5 years. The course involves remissions and exacerbations of recurrent papillomas, mostly affecting the glottic area (vocal cords), and supraglottis. The patient presents with progressively worsening hoarseness, sleep-disordered breathing, dyspnea, stridor, and severe airway obstruction if left untreated. Diagnosis confirmed by direct laryngoscopy, which shows grape-like projections (shown below), and biopsy. Treatment consists of micro laryngoscopy and CO2 laser excision. Antivirals like interferon alpha2a, ribavirin, cidofovir, and acyclovir are used as adjunct therapies. Other options: Option A: Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is caused by the parainfluenza virus. The patient initially presents with an upper respiratory tract infection (rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, cough, low-grade fever) followed by a characteristic barking cough, hoarseness, and inspiratory stridor. Option C: Vocal nodule (singer’s or screamer's nodule) occurs as a result of chronic vocal abuse. They appear symmetrically at the junction of the anterior one-third and posterior two third of the v cal cord. The patient presents with chronic hoarseness and voice fatigue. The image below shows symmetric vocal nodules: Option D: Acute epiglottitis is caused by streptococcus pyogenes, pneumococci, Hemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. It is characterized by an acute rapidly progressive course of high-grade fever, dyspnea, and stridor. Voice and Speech Disorders",

Treatment consists of botulinum toxin injections in the thyroarytenoid muscles on one or both sides to relieve the spasm. Abductor dysphonia It is due to the spasm of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle and thus the glottis is kept open. The patient gets a breathy voice or breathy breaks in voice.

        "explanation": "The image is of a Digital audiometer. An audiometer is an electronic device that produces pure tones, which can be increased or decreased in 5 dB steps. The amount of intensity that has to be raised above the normal level is a measure of the degree of hearing loss at that frequency. This is charted in the form of a graph called an audiogram. The difference in the thresholds of air and bone conduction (A–B gap) is a measure of the degree of conductive deafness. Uses: To measure the threshold of hearing of air and bone conduction Helps to predict speech reception threshold To diagnose the type of hearing loss and measure the degree For the prescription of hearing aids Helps to find the degree of handicap for medicolegal purposes A record can be kept for future reference.",

        "explanation": "The image is of a tympanometer. It is used in evaluating the status of the middle ear. It is based on a simple principle that when a sound strikes the tympanic membrane, some of the sound energy is absorbed while the rest is reflected. A stiffer tympanic membrane would reflect more sound energy than a compliant one. By charting the compliance of the tympano-ossicular system against various pressure changes, different types of graphs called tympanograms are as follows:",
