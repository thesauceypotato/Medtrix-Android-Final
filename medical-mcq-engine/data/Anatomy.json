After penetrating the zona, the sperm comes in contact with the oolemma (the plasma membrane of the oocyte). This contact results in weak membrane depolarization and a calcium wave. The calcium wave triggers the release of lysosomal enzymes from the cortical granules lining the oolemma (cortical reaction). These enzymes hydrolyze the ZP3 receptor on the zona pellucida. Digestion of ZP3 and alteration of zona pellucida (zona reaction) prevents other sperms from binding, thus creating a block to polyspermy.",

        "explanation": "The presence of meconium discharge at the umbilicus is suggestive of vitelline fistula. It occurs due to patent vitelline duct, which connects the primitive gut to the yolk sac. The primitive gut is connected to the definitive yolk sac through a narrow stalk-like communication known as the vitellointestinal duct. It is also known as vitelline duct or yolk stalk or omphalomesenteric duct. Due to the folding of the embryo in the cephalocaudal and lateral directions, the embryo gets enclosed all around by ectoderm, except in the region through which the vitellointestinal duct passes. In this region, there is a circular aperture, which is now called the umbilical opening. The vitellointestinal duct completely obliterates by the 7th week of development. Vitelline duct abnormalities: Meckel's diverticulum: In about 2% o the individuals, a portion of the vitelline duct persists an outpouching of the ileum called, Meckel diverticulum. The diverticulum is usually asymptomatic unless it contains heterotopic pancreatic or gastric mucosa, which may lead to bleeding, ulceration, or perforation. Vitelline cyst: In some individuals, both the ends of the vitelline duct transforms into fibrous cords. However, the middle portion of the duct forms a large cyst called, enterocystoma, or vitelline cyst. As the fibrous cords run across the peritoneal cavity, it may lead to intestinal obstruction, strangulation, or volvulus.",

        "correct_option": "a",
        "explanation": "The condition shown in the above image is sirenomelia. It is caused due to insufficient formation of mesoderm in the caudal most region of the embryo. The mesoderm in the caudal region is involved in the formation of lower limbs, urogenital system, and lumbosacral vertebrae. Therefore, the defects seen in this condition include hypoplasia and fusion of the lower limbs, vertebral abnormalities, renal agenesis, imperforate anus, and anomalies of the genital organs. During the third week of development, a process called gastrulation occurs which leads to the formation of all three germ layers. The process begins with the formation of the primitive streak, which develops into the primitive node and primitive pit. The primitive pit further invaginates and organizes itself into cells arranged in three layers, which eventually develop into ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Gastrulation related abnormalities: Sacrococcygeal teratomas occur due to remnants of pluripotent cells from the primitive streak. They are the most common tumor in newborns, occurring at a frequency of 1 in 37,000 births. Sacrococcygeal teratomas contain tissues derived from all three germ layers. When pluripotent cells from the primitive streak remain in the sacrococcygeal region, they proliferate to form sacrococcygeal teratomas. Holoprosencephaly is a deficiency in the midline craniofacial structures. It occurs due to teratogenic exposure (such as high alcohol dose) during gastrulation which kills the cells in the anterior midline of the embryonic disc. In holoprosencephaly, the forebrain is small, the two lateral ventricles are often merged into a single ventricle, and the eyes are close together (hypotelorism).",

As the larynx moves cranially relative to the aortic arch arteries, the recurrent laryngeal nerves on the right and left sides are caught under the 6th arch arteries. On the right side, the distal 6th arch artery disappears. Since there is no 5th arch artery, the right recurrent laryngeal nerve is caught under the 4th arch artery which becomes the future right subclavian artery. On the left side, the 6th arch artery persists, which develops into ductus arteriosus, which later forms ligamentum arteriosum. Due to the persistence of the 6th arch artery, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is caught under it and therefore, has a relatively long course. Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems",

This results in aorta arising from the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk from the left ventricle. This condition is seen in 4.8/10,000 births. Patent ductus arteriosus is commonly seen along with this condition. Sometimes, there is an associated defect in the membranous part of the interventricular septum.",

The given image shows the classic feature of cloacal exstrophy, which includes an exstrophic central bowel area flanked by two hemibladders: Bladder exstrophy: The bladder is seen turned inside out (exstrophy means turned inside out) and visible as 2 hemibladders on either side. Bowel exstrophy: The central defect is the prolapsed intestinal loop that appears as the elephant trunk deformity. The central bowel field usually contains an ileocecal segment that has prolapsed. In addition, omphalocele can be noted in the umbilical region in this image. Exstrophy of the bladder or cloaca occurs due to abnormal closure of the body wall in the pelvic region: Exstrophy of the bladder: The bladder mucosa is exposed to the surface. In male infants, epispadias is seen additionally. Exstrophy of the cloaca: The closure of the ventral body wall is more severely affected than in bladder exstrophy. There is the involvement of the bladder and rectum, both of which are derived from the cloaca. In addition, there is defective development of the urorectal septum leading to anal canal malformations and imperforate anus. As the genital swellings are widely separated, external genitalia will be defective. Cloacal exstrophy can present as part of OEIS syndrome, in which multiple anomalies are seen, where O stands for Omphalocele, E for Exstrophy of bladder or cloaca, I for Imperforate anus, and S for Skeletal anomalies.",

The pinna develops from 6 tissue elevations called the auricular hillocks formed around the margins of the dorsal portion of the 1st pharyngeal cleft. 3 hillocks are from the 1st pharyngeal (mandibular) arch 3 hillocks are from the 2nd pharyngeal (hyoid) arch. The mandibular arch contributes to the tragus of the pinna only, while the rest of the pinna is derived from the hyoid arch. Invagination of the first pharyngeal arch gives rise to the external auditory meatus. Previously, it was believed that the external auditory meatus develops from the first pharyngeal cleft. But recent studies suggest that the first pharyngeal arch gives rise to the external auditory meatus.",

The triangular area between these ducts (trigone of the bladder) is thought to arise from the terminal portion of the mesonephric ducts. Recent update: It was considered that the epithelium of the trigone is initially mesodermal and is later replaced by the endoderm-derived transitional epithelium. However, current research indicates that there is no mesodermal epithelial contribution to the bladder at the trigone (Gray's anatomy, 41st edition).",

They are present in the cell body of a neuron and in large dendrites. Under light microscopy, they appear as basophilic granules. The affinity towards the basic dyes is due to the presence of a large amount of RNA which is acidic in nature. The image below shows a photomicrograph of bluish-coloured Nissl bodies (indicated by arrows) in the cytoplasm of motor neurons. Option A: The initial segment refers to the proximal part of the axon, that lies just beyond the axon-hillock. Thus, an axon-hillock is part of the cell body while the initial segment is part of an axon. Option B: Mesaxon refers to the area where the plasma membrane of the Schwann cell fuses with itself around the axon. During the formation of the myelin sheath, the axon invaginates the Schwann cell. The plasma membrane of the Schwann cell fuses with itself and continues to wrap around the axon to form multiple layers of the plasma membrane called the myelin sheath.

The capillaries can be classified into two types: Continuous capillaries - The edges of endothelial cells fuse completely with those of adjoining cells to form a continuous wall. The exchange of material between the blood and tissue occurs through the cytoplasm of the endothelial cells or through the intercellular material adjoining the cells. Fenestrated capillaries - The walls of these capillaries have apertures in their endothelial lining which are closed by a thin diaphragm. The fenestration may also be present as pores, whic passes through the entire thickness of the cell. The exchange of material occurs by diffusion through these fenestrae. They are mainly seen in renal glomeruli, intestinal villi, endocrine glands, and pancreas. Sinusoids differ from the capillaries in that the wall sinusoid has only endothelium, which is supported by a thin layer of connective tissue.

Each branch divides and subdivides as it travels through the trabecular network. Arterioles arising from this network leave the trabeculae to pass into the inter-trabecular spaces. The spleen is histologically composed of: White pulp - For some distance, each arteriole is surrounded by a dense sheath of lymphocytes. These lymphocytes constitute the white pulp of the spleen. Penicilli - The arteriole then divides into a number of straight vessels that are called penicilli. Ellipsoid - Each of the penicilli shows a localised thickening of its wall that is called an ellipsoid. The ellipsoid consists of concentric lamellae formed by aggregation of fibroblasts and macrophages. Ampulla - Distal to the ellipsoid, the vessel dilates to form an ampulla, the walls of whic become continuous with the reticular framework. Red pulp - As a result, blood flows into spaces lined by reticular cells, coming into direct contact with lymphocytes there. The part of splenic tissue, which is infiltrated with blood in this way is called the red pulp. Sinusoids - Blood from spaces of the red pulp is collected by wide sinusoids that drain into veins in the trabeculae. Stave cells: The sinusoids of the spleen are lined by a somewhat modified endothelium. The endothelial cells here are elongated and are shaped like bananas. They are referred to as stave cells.",

It shows the presence of glycogen masses in the basal cytoplasm of the epithelial cells lining the glands which are the features of the early secretory phase of the endometrium. The uterus is made up of an external layer of smooth muscle called the myometrium, and an internal layer called the endometrium. The endometrium has three layers which are namely: Stratum compactum, Stratum spongiosum (which make up the stratum functionalis) Stratum basalis. The changes observed in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle are continuous and may be summarized as follows: Increase in thickness of endometrium - The endometrium progressively increases in thickness. In the postmenstrual phase, it is 0.5–1 mm thick; in the proliferative phase it is 2–3 mm thick, and in the secretory phase, its thickness reaches 5–7 mm. Increase in dimensions of uterine glands - The uterine glands grow in length. At first, they are straight but gradually become convoluted. Because of these convolutions, the glands acquire a 'saw-toothed' appearance when seen in the longitudinal section. The glands also increase in diameter. Change in the epithelial lining of glands - The epithelium lining the glands is at first cuboidal. During the proliferative stage, it becomes columnar. Glycogen accumulates in the basal portion of he epithelial cell, pushing the nucleus nearer the lumen. During the secretory phase, the apical part of the cell is shed off as part of the secretion and the cell again becomes cubical. Given below is a histological section of the endometrium in the proliferative phase.",

It is continuous with the conjunctival epithelium. Bowman's layer - The anterior-limiting lamina lies behind the corneal epithelium. It contains a dense mass of collagen (mainly type I collagen fibrils) set in a matrix similar to that of the substantia propria. Corneal stroma (also substantia propria) - It is a thick, transparent middle layer, consisting of regularly arranged collagen fibers along with sparsely distributed interconnected keratocytes. Descemet's membrane - It is a thin acellular layer that serves as the modified basement membrane of the corneal endothelium, from which the cells are derived. This layer is composed mainly of collagen type IV fibrils. Corneal endothelium - The endothelium covers the posterior surface of the cornea and consists of a single layer of squamous cells. The sixth layer called Dua’s layer or pre-Descemet’s layer has been recently discovered, located between the stroma and the Descemet’s membrane.",

Arachnoid villi are diverticulums of the subarachnoid space that pierces the dura mater. Grouped arachnoid villi produce elevations called arachnoid granulations. When the CSF pressure is higher than the venous pressure of the sinus, CSF flows from the subarachnoid space into the venous sinuses via the arachnoid villi. If the venous pressure exceeds CSF pressure, the arachnoid villi close and prevent the reflux of blood into the arachnoid space. Some CSF is also directly absorbed into the veins in the subarachnoid space. The CSF production from choroid plexuses is usually constant. Therefore, the rate of absorption through the arachnoid villi controls the CSF pressure. The image below shows the pulsatile CSF movement.",

Frey's syndrome is caused due to aberrant regeneration of the postganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers of the auriculotemporal nerve. The nerve fibres regenerate into the nearby sweat glands. It can occur following parotid surgery, or any trauma where there is an injury to the parotid capsule. This results in sweating, warmth, and redness of the face during the salivary stimulation by the smell or taste of food. Hence, Frey's syndrome is also known as gustatory sweating or auriculotemporal syndrome.",

The tensor tympani and the stapedius are the muscles of the middle ear and they are innervated by branches of V and VII cranial nerves respectively. Both these muscles contract in response to loud noises and thereby dampen sound. The tensor tympani increases the tension of the tympanic membrane and reduces the force of vibration. Stapedius pulls the stapes posteriorly and reduces the oscillations. Paralysis of one or both of these muscles causes increased sensitivity to the sounds, a condition known as hyperacusis.",

Pretracheal fascia encloses the thyroid gland and is attached to the larynx. This attachment is responsible for the movement of the enlarged thyroid gland on deglutition. The thyrohyoid membrane is a fibro-elastic ligament, which arises from the superior margin of the thyroid cartilage, and gets attached to the hyoid bone. It facilitates the upward movement of the larynx during swallowing. The ligament of Berry, also called the suspensory ligament extends from the cricoid cartilage to the thyroid. Its attachment prevents the thyroid gland from sinking down into the mediastinum.",

When only one muscle contracts, it protrudes and pushes the tongue to the opposite side. It depresses the central part of the tongue. It is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve. In conditions affecting the hypoglossal nerve, the genioglossus muscle on that side is paralyzed. In such cases, when the patient protrudes the tongue, it deviates towards the affected side due to the muscle contraction on the normal side. The genioglossi are attached to the genial tubercle present on the mandible. This prevents the tongue from falling backwards and obstructing respiration. Hence this muscle is known as the safety muscle of the tongue.",

It occurs due to the disruption of the sympathetic nerve supply. In the autonomic nervous system, the sympathetic plexus is thoracolumbar and the parasympathetic plexus is craniosacral. The sympathetic plexus is formed along the side of the spinal cord by white ramus inflow (preganglionic nerve fibers) and gray ramus outflow (postganglionic) and it extends from T1-L2. In Horner's syndrome, since the sympathetic inflow is disrupted, the white ramus of the spinal cord is affected as shown below.

It is prone to be injured in radial head fractures as the nerve winds around the radial neck to go into the posterior compartment of the forearm. There is no cutaneous sensory loss in lesions confined to the posterior interosseous nerve. The radial nerve divides into 2 branches, namely superficial (sensory) and deep (motor) branches at the cubital fossa. Deep radial nerve after supplying extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) and supinator, continues as posterior interosseous nerve (PIN). From the posterior compartment, the supinator muscle wraps around the upper 1/3rd of the radius to reach the anterior compartment. PIN arches and winds around the radial neck along with the supinator muscle, into the posterior compartment of the forearm. Hence, it is in close relation with the radial head and neck, and the supinator arch or arcade of Froese. There is no cutaneous innervation by the posterior interosseous nerve.",

The test determines the integrity between superficial and deep palmar arches and the patency of the radial and ulnar arteries at the wrist. Each one of the arteries is compressed at a time. The individual artery which is sufficient to maintain the arterial supply to the hand in isolation is noted. Procedure: The patient makes a tight fist, examiner digitally compresses both ulnar and radial arteries. The patient opens the fist to reveal the pale palm. Ulnar artery compression is removed, palm turns red including the thumb zone (positive modified Allen's test). If blood fails to return to the palm including the thumb zone, it reveals the anastomosis between the 2 palmar arches is inadequate (negative modified Allen's test). If the hand does not flush within 5–15 seconds (modified Allen's test negative), it indicates that ulnar circulation is inadequate or nonexistent.

It is formed when the intestinal and two lumbar lymph trunks join to form cisterna chyli which continues as the thoracic duct. Course: It passes through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm and enters the posterior mediastinum lying to the right between the aorta and the azygos vein up till T4-T5 vertebra. It then crosses over to the left side posterior to the esophagus. It continues upwards in the superior mediastinum and arches over the subclavian artery and descends anteriorly to drain into the confluence of the left jugular vein and left subclavian vein. It receives lymph from both halves of the body below the diaphragm and only the left half of the head and neck, upper limb, and thorax.",

Clinical Note: Familial adenomatous polyposis [APC gene defect] is associated with carcinoma of the Ampulla of Vater. Duodenal villous adenomas are commonly found around the ampulla of Vater and they are premalignant. Duodenal injuries with tissue loss distal to the major duodenal papilla and proximal to the superior mesenteric vessels are best treated by Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy.",

The pancreas has two ducts which normally fuse during embryologic development: The accessory (dorsal) pancreatic duct (of Santorini) drains the upper part of the anterior portion of the pancreatic head. The main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung) usually runs within the substance of the gland from left to right. When the ventral and dorsal ducts fail to fuse together, it results in pancreas divisum. In this condition, the majority of the pancreas drains via a dominant dorsal duct that enters the duodenum at the minor papilla. A short ventral duct, along with the bile duct, drains into the major duodenal papilla. Therefore, the major drainage of the pancreas is done by the dorsal duct which opens up into the minor papilla. Patients with this condition are usually asymptomatic, however, 25-38% of these patients experience recurrent pancreatitis that may further progress to chronic pancreatitis. Image A: Normal pancreatic ducts with communication between main and accessory ducts. Image B: Normal pancreatic ducts and no communication between main and accessory ducts.

        "correct_option": "b",
        "explanation": "The structure involved in causing lurching gait in the child is gluteus medius (marked as 2). The gluteus medius originates from the outer surface of the ilium between the anterior and posterior gluteal lines. Insertion of the muscle is at the lateral surface of the greater trochanter. It is supplied by the superior gluteal nerve. Gluteus medius and minimus are powerful abductors of the hip joint. Mechanism of actions of gluteus medius and minimus: When the leg on one side is lifted off the ground, the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, on the opposite supported side, exert traction on the hip bone by acting from the femur. This action results in a slight raising of the pelvis on the unsupported side, which helps maintain the trunk in the upright position. The actions of these muscles are affected when there is an injury to the superior gluteal nerve, neck of the femur, or loss of normal angulation of the shaft of the femur. This occurs in conditions ike paralysis of the glutei, developmental dysplasia of the hip, etc. When the gluteus medius and minimus are paralyzed, the pelvis sinks down on the unsupported (normal) side, when the patient tries to stand on the affected limb. This leads to a positive Trendelenburg's sign with a characteristic lurching gait - the patient lurches towards the affected side with contralateral pelvis drop. Other options 1 - Gluteus maximus - involved in the extension of flexed thigh, abduction (only upper fibres), and ateral rotation at the hip joint. Insertion is at the iliotibial tract. 3 - Piriformis - involved in lateral rotation and assists abduction at the hip joint. It is inserted into the medial side of greater trochanter of the femur. Entrapment of the sciatic nerve in the piriformis can lead to piriformis syndrome. 4 - Sciatic nerve - The nerve passes over the obturator internus, gemellus superior, gemellus inferior and quadratus femoris. It supplies knee flexors and muscles below the knee. Paralysis of this nerve results in flail foot and severe difficulty in walking.",

The patient shows characteristic lurching gait/ Trendelenburg's gait (positive Trendelenburg's sign), which is seen in paralysis of gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles. These muscles are supplied by the superior gluteal nerve. When the leg on one side is lifted off the ground, the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, on the opposite supported side, exert traction on the hip bone by acting from the femur. This action results in the slight raising of the pelvis on the unsupported side, which helps maintain the trunk in the upright position. When the gluteus medius and minimus are paralyzed, the pelvis sinks down on the unsupported (normal) side, when the patient tries to stand on the affected limb. In the given case, when the patient lifts up his right leg and tries to stand on the left leg, his right pelvis tilts down. This shows that the left side abduction mechanism is paralyzed and the right side is normal. Hence, the left superior gluteal nerve injury is present in this case. The image given below shows the Trendelenberg test. Note: Inferior gluteal nerve supplies the gluteus maximus muscle.",

This canal is surrounded by multiple layers or lamellae of the calcified matrix containing type I collagen fibers. These canals communicate with each other by Volkmann's canal.
