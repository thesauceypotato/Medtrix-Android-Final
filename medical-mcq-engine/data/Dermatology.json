        "explanation": "Development of skin includes activation of Wnt signaling. The lack of Wnt signaling promotes the neural fate of the neuroectoderm cells. A single layer of neuroectoderm forms the nervous system or the skin epithelium depending on the molecular signals it receives. Activation of Wnt signaling blocks the response of ectoderm to fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and the cells express bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). This leads to the epidermal fate of the neuroectoderm.",

They also have a tendency for developing rapid flushing due to temperature change. Rosacea is more common in women of age 30-50 years. The innate immune response in rosacea appears to be altered. There is increased Toll■like receptor 2 (TLR2) activity and increased protease activity. Demodex mite proliferation in the pilosebaceous follicles of the face has also been suggested as a possible aetiological factor in cutaneous and ocular inflammation.

Acné excoriée is regarded as a self■inflicted skin condition in which the sufferer compulsively picks real or imagined acne lesions predominantly on the face. It is mostly seen in adolescent girls. Other psychiatric disorders associated with acne are: Body dysmorphic disorder - Some patients have acne as their prime symptom. The perceived acne is out of proportion to physical signs. Eating disorders - reported in anorexia nervosa. Acne itself may be a predisposing factor for anorexia in vulnerable teenaged age groups who adopt a diet in an attempt to control their acne. Option B: Acne fulminans or acne maligna is a rare and severe destructive form of acne presenting primarily in adolescent males. It most frequently affects the trunk but can affect the face and presents acutely in association with systemic symptoms. Options C: Acne conglobata represents a rare and severe form of acne characterized by multiple and extensive inflammatory papules, tender nodules, and abscesses which commonly coalesce to form malodorous draining sinus tracts.

Rhinophyma may be diagnosed clinically, but a skin biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. On histology, rhinophyma shows sebaceous gland hypertrophy, hyperplasia and fibrosis.

Anagen can continue for several years and the duration of this phase is responsible for determining the final length of the hair. Normally, 80–90% of hair follicles on the human scalp are in anagen at any one time. It can be identified by the presence of angulated roots. Catagen: At the end of anagen, epithelial cell division slows and stops, and the follicle enters an involutionary phase known as catagen. The proximal end of the hair shaft keratinizes to form a club-shaped structure and the lower part of the follicle involutes by apoptosis. It lasts for about 3 weeks. Telogen: It is the resting phase between catagen and the next anagen. Clubbing becomes more prominent. It lasts for about 3 months. Club hair is eventually shed through an active process called exogen. In the human scalp, hair follicles may remain in a state of latency, also known as kenogen, for a prolonged period after the club hair is shed.",

Type 2 is present in androgen-responsive tissues such as the dermal papillae of the hair follicle, prostate, epididymides, and seminal vesicles. Type 2 5 ■reductase also plays a key role in regulating androgen-dependent hair growth. Hair growth in the following areas is androgen dependent: Beard, chest, and extremity hair in males Scalp, pubic, and axillary hair in both sexes Male-pattern hair loss: Male-pattern hair loss causes thinning of the vertex and an M-shaped receding hairline, as shown below. High levels of circulating androgens stimulate hair loss in certain sites by a process called miniaturization. Finasteride reverses this process.",

Androgenetic alopecia is a disorder characterized by a reduction of hair fiber production by follicles and miniaturization. It is of two types , male pattern and female pattern hair loss. Male pattern hair loss may occur in female & vice versa is also true. Male pattern hair loss causes frontal hairline recession and thinning of the vertex. Miniaturization refers to a reduction in the size of follicles until it leaves behind a remnant called stelae or streamers. Elastic staining of the stelae shows Arao-Perkin's bodies. DHT is a more potent form of testosterone. It is responsible for follicular regression and thus causes androgenic alopecia. Finasteride inhibits the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT and hence is used for treatment. Minoxidil is a potent vasodilator. It is used orally to treat severe hypertension.

Older patients with grey hair have a mixture of white and pigmented hair. If the disease progresses rapidly, only pigmented hair will be affected, sparing the white hair. This leads to a dramatic change in overall hair color that is called going white overnight. The following image shows patches of hair loss with sparing of white hair. Option A: Hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss and diffuse hair thinning but a change in hair color is not a feature. Options C and D: Telogen effluvium and psychological stress (which also causes telogen effluvium) lead to diffuse hair loss that affects all hair equally, not just pigmented hairs. So, overall hair color will not be affected.",

This is characteristic of tinea capitis. Though the diagnosis is clinical, a KOH mount is used for confirmation. Scrapings from the edge of a lesion are transferred to a slide, to which KOH is added. It is then examined under the microscope for the presence of hyphae, as shown below. Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection primarily occurring in children. Clinical features of tinea capitis are patchy hair loss, scaling, tender lymphadenopathy, and in severe cases, there might be pustules and crusting of the affected area along with sinus formation. The clinical variants of tinea capitis are: Endothrix - a non-inflammatory type in which multiple black dots are present within the areas of alopecia. It is most commonly caused by T. tonsurans and T. violaceum. Ectothrix - a mild inflammatory type in which single or multiple scaly patches with hair loss are seen. Microsporum audouinii, M.canis, M.equinnum, and M.ferrugineum cause ectothrix infection. Kerion - a severe inflammatory type that presents with an inflammatory mass with thick crusting and matting of hair with pus and sinus formation. It is commonly caused by T. verrucosum and T. mentagrophytes. Favus - is characterized by the presence of yellowish, cup■shaped crusts known as scutula that develop around hair follicles. It is caused by T. schoenleinii Treatment: Terbinafine: <10 Kg- 62.5 mg; 10-20 kg - 125 mg; >20 kg- 250 mg, all given daily for 4 weeks. Itraconazole: 2-4 mg/kg/day for 4-6 weeks.",

It is distinguished from the nevus of Ota by its location in the area innervated by the posterior supraclavicular and lateral cutaneous brachial nerves. Complications of nevus of Ota include meningeal melanocytoma of the brain, and malignant melanoma involving the meninges, choroid, iris, or orbit. In some rare cases, cutaneous melanoma can develop. Pigment targeting Q■switched laser systems is the treatment of choice. Becker nevus is a large, pigmented hairy patch on the shoulder, chest, or back of young males. Nevus spilus is a congenital nevus presenting as a lentiginous macule that develops into multiple macules in a speckled distribution (image below).",

Chloasma is very common in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and is most marked in brunettes. It is due to increased levels of estrogen and progesterone, stimulating the activity of melanocytes. Histopathology shows no increase in number but hyper-functional melanocytes. It resolves on its own after pregnancy. Melasma is the most common cause of chronic facial melanosis. It is manifested by hyperpigmented macules that become more pronounced after sun exposure. Hypermelanosis affects mainly the upper lip, the malar regions, forehead, and chin. It is more common in women between 20-40 years. It is frequently seen in women on oral contraceptives. Wood's lamp examination is useful to differentiate the level of pigmentation and treatment response: Epidermal melasma- shows enhanced color contrast Dermal melasma- shows less color contrast (more resistant to treatment) Mixed melasma. Melasma is more chronic and requires treatment with depigmenting agents like: Kligman's triple combination - topical hydroquinone + tretinoin + corticosteroid compound cream (first line) Hydroquinone (reduces tyrosinase activity) Kojic acid (tyrosinase inhibitor) Chemical peels",

The scratch marks and excoriations shown in the image are due to pruritis, which is the hallmark feature of AD. AD is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition. It presents with erythematous macules, papules and vesicles that often start in early childhood, usually less than 2 years old. The lesions later become excoriated and lichenified. It is frequently associated with dryness of the skin and secondary infections. In infancy, the lesions initially appear on face (sparing the napkin area) and later on extensor aspect of knees and elbows as the child starts crawling. In later childhood and in adults, the principal site of involvement is flexures. The filaggrin monomers in keratinocytes in the epidermis bind and aggregate keratin bundles and intermediate filaments to form the epidermal barrier. Any damage/dysfunction of this barrier is associated with an increased risk of developing AD. Damage to this barrier can be due to environmental factors (detergents, hard water, UV light) or local inflammatory reactions. Dysfunction of the barrier can be due to genetic mutation of the FLG gene leading to reduced filaggrin production or local immunomodulatory effects leading to reduced filaggrin expression. Other options: Option A: Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by erythema, pruritus, scaling, flaking, or crusting of the skin. It is often associated with Malasezzia fungal infection. A milder form of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp is commonly known as dandruff. Option C: Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is an inflammatory condition caused due to a delayed hypersensitivity reaction (Type 4 hypersensitivity) to a specific allergen that comes into direct contact with the skin.Patients usually present with pruritus, erythema, swelling, papules, and papulovesicles. Some common allergens include nickel (found in artificial jewelry), PPD/Para phenylene diamine (in hair dye), chromate (in cement), rubber or latex, cosmetics, etc. Patch test (image below) is used for the diagnosis of ACD. Option D: Erysipelas is a bacterial skin infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) characterized by raised, erythematous sharply demarcated rapidly spreading skin lesions, along with systemic symptoms like fever and chills. The skin may also have a peau d'orange or orange peel-like appearance.",

Typically, FDE presents as a sharply defined, round, or oval erythematous and oedematous plaque, which evolves to become dusky, violaceous, and occasionally vesicular or bullous lesions. Lesions are usually solitary or few in number. Commonly affected sites include the lips, genitals, palms, and soles; 5% of cases may have an exclusive mucosal involvement. Overall, the most common site involved is the genitalia. The majority of FDE is self■limiting with an excellent prognosis. Note: The generalized bullous form of FDE should be differentiated from toxic epidermal necrolysis by prior similar history, absence of target lesions, and no involvement of mucosal surfaces.",

Indeterminate leprosy is usually the first sign of the disease, found during the screening of contacts of a known case. Clinical features include: Hypopigmented or coppery-brown macules, or patches of variable sizes. Number of lesions depends on the cell-mediated immunity. Sensory loss- rare Loss of ability to differentiate temperature A slit-skin smear is usually negative. It is confirmed by the demonstration of acid-fast bacilli in Fite-stained sections. Most cases resolve spontaneously. With treatment, the prognosis is good. The image below shows a high-power Fite-Faraco staining of a skin lesion showing globi of M.leprae. Option A: Borderline tuberculoid type presents with 1-10 dry, scaly, hypopigmented lesions with or without satellite lesions with diminished sensations and slit skin smear showing scanty bacilli. Option B: Pityriasis alba presents with single or few hypopigmented macules on the face with normal sensation, normal sweating. There is a history of atopy and waxing and waning of lesions. Option D- Nevus depigmentosus is a congenital pigmentary disorder that presents with a non-progressive hypopigmented macule. It usually is present from birth or early childhood and remains stable throughout life.",

Lepromin test is a prognostic test used in the classification of Leprosy. It has no diagnostic purpose. It involves performing an intradermal injection of the lepromin antigen (synthesized from M. leprae) on the flexor surface of the forearm. It is a skin test for delayed hypersensitivity, is the only method for studying immunity in leprosy. Positive test - good cell-mediated immunity and points towards the tuberculoid side of the pectrum Negative test - poor cell-mediated immunity and POINTS towards the lepromatous side of the pectrum. The antigens used in lepromin test are: Lepromin A (from armadillo-derived lepra bacilli) Dharmendra antigen First is the early reaction of Fernandez, which consists of erythema and induration developing in 24-48 hours and usually remaining for 3-5 days; it is usually poorly defined and carries less significance. The second and more meaningful result is the late reaction of Mitsuda, starting at 1-2 weeks (7-10 days), reaching a peak in three or four weeks, and gradually subsiding over the next few weeks. At end of 21 days, if there is a nodule >5mm in diameter, the reaction is said to be positive. The test is used for the following purposes: To classify the lesions of leprosy patients. To assess the prognosis and response to treatment. To assess the resistance of individuals to leprosy. To verify the identity of candidate lepra bacilli. Option A: Sensory testing is useful to detect hypoesthesia and nerve involvement of leprosy. Option B: Slit skin smear shows the presence of acid-fast bacilli. Option D: Biopsy would reveal few tuberculoid granulomas and plenty of foam cells, which are diagnostic of leprosy.",

The mucous membranes within the affected dermatomes are involved in shingles. Herpes zoster/shingles is an acute cutaneous segmental eruption due to the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus from dorsal root ganglia. An earlier infection with varicella is essential before zoster can occur. The first symptom of zoster is usually pain, 1-3 days after which the lesions appear. Occasionally, the pain may not be followed by the eruption (‘zoster sine eruptione’). The patients are infectious, both from the virus in the lesions and nasopharynx. The most commonly involved dermatomes in decreasing order of frequency are thoracic > cervical > trigeminal > lumbosacral. The incidence of ophthalmic zoster increase with age. The posterior nerve roots and ganglia show inflammatory changes. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is a variant of zoster involving the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1). Herpes zoster oticus/Ramsay Hunt syndrome is another variant involving the geniculate ganglion and presents with ipsilateral facial nerve palsy, otalgia and vesicles over external ear. Zoster is a self-limiting infection but it is painful and carries a risk of secondary infection and post-herpetic neuralgia. Analgesia and treatment of secondary infections are sufficient for mild infections.

There are 2 other differentials—leprosy and tinea versicolor. The presence of hypopigmented macules over the trunk and face, suggests a differential of leprosy, but the nerves and sensations are normal, hence ruling it out. There is no scaling visible in the lesions, ruling out tinea versicolor. In kala-azar, after a variable period of years or months, diffuse nodulation begins to develop in these macules. The rash is progressive over many years and seldom heals spontaneously. As it may persist for up to 20 years, these patients may act as a chronic reservoir of infection.

Pharyngeal and rectal infections can also occur depending on the type of sexual contact. The primary site of infection in women is the cervix but the urethra, rectum, and pharynx may be involved. Symptoms include excessive vaginal discharge, dysuria, deep dyspareunia, postcoital and intermenstrual bleeding. The most common cause of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) is Chlamydia, which has an incubation period of 1-3 weeks. It usually presents with dysuria alone, but mucopurulent discharge can occur. Other causes of NGU are Mycoplasma genitalium and Trichomonas vaginalis.",

        "explanation": "The neonate is most likely suffering from Harlequin ichthyosis, as evidenced by the presence of armor-like skin. It is the most devastating type of autosomal recessive congenital icthyosis. It is due to mutations of the ABCA12 gene. The gene plays a role in lamellar body formation in the stratum granulosum and desquamation of the stratum corneum. It presents in the neonatal period with armor■like skin (truncal plates with fissuring). It can impair body movement and breathing. Bilateral ectropion and eclabium are present. Respiratory problems are the major cause of death due to alveolar collapse in neonates. They are also prone to skin and lung infections. Defective lamellar bodies in the stratum granulosum seen in electron microscopy are pathognomic of Harlequin ichthyosis. In early life, constant supportive care is required. Treatment includes moisturizing cream, antibiotics, etretinate, or retinoids. Other options - Option A) Ichthyosis vulgaris - The most common type of ichthyosis, involving mutations in filaggrin protein. Filaggrin is an epidermal protein that helps retain moisture in the stratum corneum. Ichthyosis is not present at birth but develops during the first months of life. The scaling usually involves the extensor surfaces of the extremities with flexural sparing. They are strongly correlated with atopic dermatitis and other forms of atopy such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, etc. Option B) Bathing suit ichthyosis is a type of congenital ichthyosis caused by mutations in the TGM1 gene. It presents as a collodion baby at birth where the neonate is encased in a shiny parchment■like membrane. Shedding of the collodion membrane is followed by the development of large dark grey/brownish scales affecting the trunk and the scalp, but sparing the face and extremities resembling a bathing suit. The disease tends to become worse in the summer months and improves in winter. Option D) Lamellar ichthyosis is also a congenital ichthyosis, involving mutations in the TGM1 gene. It is characterized by large plate■like dark■brown hyperkeratoses covering the entire body with mild palmoplantar involvement. The extreme spectrum of lamellar ichthyosis is congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (CIE) which is similar to erythroderma seen in psoriasis.",

This is seen in systemic sclerosis. The majority of cases are adult-onset with Raynaud's phenomenon as the first symptom. The earliest cutaneous manifestations are non■pitting edema and puffiness, which tend to be seen first in the fingers, hands, and face. The skin becomes taut, indurated, thickened, and then fixed to deeper structures on the fingers resulting in sclerodactyly.

The most important indications for performing capillaroscopy include differential diagnosis of primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, as well as the assessment of scleroderma spectrum disorders. In systemic sclerosis, capillary abnormalities appear and evolve in a clearly defined sequence called the scleroderma pattern, which correlates with internal organ involvement.

The undermined edges of the ulcer show neutrophilic infiltration. Deep ulcers heal with a characteristic cribriform or criss-cross pattern of scarring. The pustular form of PG is associated mainly with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis > Crohn's disease), the bullous form with hematological malignancies. Pathergy is the phenomenon whereby skin trauma provokes lesions at the site of injury. It is seen in pyoderma gangrenosum, Behcet's disease.

The lesions in Sweet's Syndrome are most commonly distributed on the arms, upper body, head, and neck. An associated fever and peripheral leucocytosis are commonly seen and females are more frequently affected. Histological findings include a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate with edema. Three subgroups are recognized: Classica Malignancy-associated Drug-induced Option A: Behcet's syndrome is also a neutrophilic dermatosis but presents as recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcers with an erythematous halo. Option B: Pyoderma gangrenosum, another neutrophilic dermatosis presents as painful ulcerative erythematous plaques or papules with undermined violaceous borders.
