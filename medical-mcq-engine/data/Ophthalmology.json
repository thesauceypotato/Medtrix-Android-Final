This reduced axial length causes light to converge behind the retina, leading to hypermetropia. Additionally, the corneal diameter at birth is 10 mm. The adult size (11.7 mm) is attained by 2 years of age. The orbit is more divergent (50°) as compared to adult (45°).

The circle of least confusion/ circle of diffusion lies at the mid-point of this interval. F r the given Sturm's conoid, At point A, a horizontal oval is formed because vertical rays converge more rapidly than horizontal rays. At point B, vertical rays come to a focus, while horizontal rays are still converging; so, it will be a horizontal straight line. At points C, D, and E, the vertical rays are diverging and horizontal rays are still converging. At point D, the vertical rays have diverged as much as the horizontal rays have converged; so, we get a perfect circle called the circle of least confusion. At point E, a vertical oval is formed.

Phototransduction: Rhodopsin is a G-protein-coupled receptor found in the outer segments of rod photoreceptors. 11-cis-retinal (a chromophore) is covalently bound to opsins via a lysine residue on one of the transmembrane domains. The receptor is activated by photo-isomerization of prebound 11-cis-retinal t ALL-TRANS-retinal. Activation of the receptor causes binding and activation of the G protein, transducin, with signal transduction via cGMP phosphodiesterase, resulting in a decrease in the intracellular cGMP levels and closure of the cGMP-gated Na channels. This causes hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cell, which modulates neurotransmitter release at the synapse with bipolar cells. This entire process triggered by the activation of rhodopsin is phototransduction, which occurs in the outer segment of photoreceptors and converts light energy into an electrical signal. Chromophore regeneration: All-trans retinAL is converted to all-trans-retinOL. All-trans-retinOL gets transported by interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) to the retinal pigment epithelial cells, where it is reconstituted into the 11-cis retinal isoform.",

Theories of color vision: Trichromatic theory (Young–Helmholtz theory) assumes that there are three types of color receptors. Each receptor is assumed to respond to all wavelengths, however, each has different spectral sensitivities. Opponent process theory, also known as the Hering theory, assumes three sets of receptor systems—red-green, blue-yellow, and black-white. Each one of these functions as an antagonistic pair (e.g., red light stimulates the red receptors and, at the same time, inhibits the green). Edwin Land's theory has three separate color systems (retinexes). Each is an analog to a black-and-white picture.",

It is controlled by the ipsilateral parieto-occipital lobe. F llowing an object from the right to left is left pursuit and is controlled by ipsilateral (left) parieto-occipital lobe, and the corrective movement is a saccade (in this case, left to right) termed right saccade and is controlled by the contralateral (left) frontal lobe. The floccular nucleus is found in the lobule HX of the cerebellar vermis. Its functions include matching pulse-step, gaze holding, and sustained smooth pursuit. Bilateral lesions of the flocculus result in the following: Post-saccadic drift- saccadic movements do not stop, but there is a brief, several hundred milliseconds drift of the eyes after each saccade. Saccadic pursuit- smooth tracking is replaced by simultaneous rapid jerking motions of the eye to follow an object toward the ipsilateral visual field.

The first number is the refractive power of the spherical component. It is represented as convex (+) or concave (-) dioptre sphere (DS). The second number denotes the power of the cylinder, represented as convex (+) or concave (-) dioptre cylinder (DC). The above two components are followed by an x representing the axis (orientation) of the cylinder. In the most common type of SMA - with-the-rule astigmatism - meridian A (represented by 90&deg;) is more curved than meridian B (represented by 180&deg;). The light rays refracting from B focus on the retina, whereas those refracting from A focus in front of the retina. To correct this error, a negative cylindrical lens (DC) is used to focus the myopic rays of meridian A on the retina. This correction needs to occur at 90&deg; (meridian A). The axis of a cylindrical lens is perpendicular to the required correction and thus, the spectacles will have an axis of 180&deg;.

Roving-ring scotoma: The edge of a convex lens acts as a prism. The greater the angle of the prism, the more will be the bending. In aphakic spectacles, the angle of the lens is large. Thus, the light falling at the edge of the lens bends towards the center of the lens and does not reach the pupil. This results in a ring-shaped scotoma as this prismatic effect is present all around the edges of the lens. The position of this scotoma is not fixed in the visual field because the eye keeps moving (or roving) in relation to the aphakic spectacle. Hence, the result is a roving ring scotoma.",

        "explanation": "Moraxella species, a type of gram-negative diplobacilli, are involved in causing angular conjunctivitis which is a type of chronic conjunctivitis. Angular conjunctivitis is a chronic type of conjunctivitis where there is inflammation of the conjunctiva at the lid margins and the inner and outer canthi of the eyes with red, scaly, excoriated, macerated and fissured skin at the canthi. This is because of the proteolytic enzymes secreted by the Moraxella species. Patients with angular conjunctivitis usually experience eye irritation, a burning sensation and collection of dirty-white, foamy discharge at the angles. These patients can also have associated blepharitis and papillary and follicular conjunctivitis. Causative organisms are Moraxella lacunata, Moraxella axenfeld and Staphylococcus aureus (Rare cause). The source of infection is typically the nasal tract or the nasal discharge of patients with angular conjunctivitis. The infection spreads from the nasal cavity to the eyes through contaminated hands or handkerchiefs. Treatment includes oxytetracycline 1% ointment for 10 to 14 days, and zinc oxide as it inhibits proteolytic enzymes. The image given below shows the eye of a patient infected with angular conjunctivitis. Other options: Option B: Haemophilus influenzae causes acute conjunctivitis. Option C: Adenovirus is the most common cause of viral conjunctivitis and it most commonly causes follicular conjunctivitis, pharyngoconjunctival fever, and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.

Clinical features: Astigmatism with the rule - most common finding Stocker's line - deposition of iron on the advancing edge Fuchs islets - small, discrete, whitish flecks consisting of clusters of pterygial epithelial cells, often present at the advancing edge. The differential diagnosis is pseudo pterygium. The treatment for pterygium is usually excision. To prevent a recurrence, mitomycin C or 5 fluorouracil is used. Other methods: Auto-grafting- Conjunctival limbal autograft (CLAG) from the superior limbal conjunctiva is the best method. Bare sclera technique- high recurrence rate of 30 to 80%. PERFECT surgery- zero rates of recurrence.

Cicatrising trachoma is stage 3 of trachoma and is characterized by scarring of the palpebral conjunctiva. Cicatricial trachoma is the end result of scarring that occurs in individuals who suffer from severe, persistent infections in childhood. Trachomatous scarring is recognized by the presence of easily visible white bands on the underside of the upper eyelid. Severe scarring can result in contraction of the tarsal conjunctiva which causes the lid margin to roll inwards. This results in buckling of the lid so the lashes rub on the eye known as trachomatous trichiasis. These lashes can lead to corneal opacities and scarring and eventually blindness. The four stages of trachoma according to McCallan are as follows: Stage 1: Incipient - Immature follicles are present, but clinical symptoms are not obvious. Stage 2: Established - Typical trachomatous lesions without scarring. Stage 3: Cicatrising - Scarring along with active infection. Stage 4: Healed - Only scarring, the disease is either cured or quiet. The image below shows trachomatous trichiasis with severe scarring-",

The endothelium possesses Na+/K+ ATPase, which keeps the corneal stroma in a relatively dehydrated state. This helps maintain corneal transparency. Endothelial cells decrease in number with age. If the cornea becomes overhydrated, it begins to scatter light and gradually begins to lose its transparency Other factors contributing to the transparency of the cornea are as follows: Regular arrangement of corneal lamellae (Maurice theory) The peculiar refractive index of corneal lamellae (Goldmann theory) Avascularity of the cornea A balance between the intraocular pressure (IOP) and swelling pressure The different layers of the cornea are as follows: Epithelium Bowman’s membrane Stroma (substantia propria) Dua’s layer (pre-Descemet’s layer) Descemet’s membrane Endothelium",

Donor tissues are screened for stress lines, mechanical trauma, scarring, corneal edema, and infiltrates that could indicate poor tissue quality. They are further evaluated for thickness and endothelial cell density (a surrogate for endothelial function) which are important determinants of successful graft transplantation. Endothelial cell density (ECD) and morphology are assessed using a specular microscope or by a bright-field/phase-contrast light microscope. Note: The number of cells decreases at about 0.6% per year, and the neighboring cells enlarge to fill the space as the cells cannot regenerate. At a density of about 500 cells/mm2, corneal edema develops and transparency is impaired. This is known as critical endothelial density.",

Fungal corneal ulcer also known as mycotic keratitis is usually caused by trauma from vegetative matter such as branches of trees, leaves and animal tails. Injudicious use of topical steroids and antibiotics increases the predisposition to develop secondary fungal keratitis. Mycotic keratitis can be caused by Filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus and Fusarium Yeasts such as Candida and cryptococcus Dimorphic fungi such as Histoplasma and Blastomyces Typically in fungal corneal ulcers, the signs are more prominent than the symptoms. The symptoms of fungal keratitis are similar to that of bacterial ulcers which include pain, lacrimation, photophobia, blurred vision, and redness of the eyes. A typical fungal ulcer has the following signs: Greyish white looking dry corneal ulcer with rolled out margin. Feathery finger-like extensions into the corneal stroma under intact epithelium Wessley ring which is a sterile immune ring that occurs due to the deposition of immune complexes Multiple small satellite lesions around the ulcer Hypopyon: The hypopyon in fungal ulcer is immobile and unsterile unlike bacterial ulcer (sterile hypopyon) Perforation is rare Corneal vascularization is usually absent. A diagnosis of fungal ulcer is made by a typical history of trauma with vegetative matter followed by clinical examination and KOH mount or SDA agar cultures from corneal scrappings. The image below depicts a fungal corneal ulcer with the arrowhead indicating a satellite lesion. Other options: Option A: Anterior uveitis is the inflammation of the uveal tissue from the iris up to the pars plicata of the ciliary body. Infectious uveitis can be caused by the exogenous entry of the organisms following penetrating injuries, perforation of corneal ulcer, and post-intaocular operations. Acute anterior uveitis presents with symptoms of pain, photophobia, lacrimation, blurring of vision and redness of the eye. Signs of anterior uveitis include: Aqueous flare - It is the earliest sign of acute anterior uveitis, it occurs following the leakage of protein particles into the aqueous humor. Keratic precipitates(KP) - These are pathognomonic for anterior uveitis. They are proteinaceous cellular deposits at the back of the cornea arranged in a triangular fashion. These include mutton fat KP's as seen in granulomatous uveitis and granular KP's of non granulomatous uveitis. Iris nodules: typically occur in granulomatous uveitis. Koppe's nodules are at the pupillary border and Busacca's nodules are situated near the collarette. Option C: Conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva of which the bacterial conjunctivitis is the most common. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is characterized by marked conjunctival hyperemia, swelling of the conjunctiva(chemosis), edematous eyelids, sticking together of lid margins and mucopurulent discharge from the eye. The image shows a patient with bacterial conjunctivitis. Option D: Corneal laceration: Partial corneal laceration or lamellar corneal laceration occurs from a blunt trauma and is treated by patching and antibiotics.",

Corneal tattooing is a treatment option in patients with corneal opacities, who have lost their vision or who do not expect to recover it. It improves cosmetic appearance by altering the white colour of the opacity and blending it to normal eye colour. Depending on the density, corneal opacities are graded as nebula, macula and leucoma. Nebular corneal opacity (fog or mist): Hard-to-see corneal scar, due to superficial scars involving Bowman's layer and superficial stroma. Slit-lamp detection is required. A thin, diffuse nebula covering the pupillary area interferes more with vision than the localised leucoma away from the pupillary area. Nebula produces more discomfort due to blurred image (irregular astigmatism). Macular corneal opacity: Semi-dense opacity that can be seen with proper illumination. Due to scarring involving about half the corneal stroma. Leucomatous corneal opacity (leucoma simplex): White scar that is easily seen just by looking at the eye. Due to scarring of more than half of the stroma Adherent leucoma: It results when healing occurs after perforation of the cornea with incarceration of iris Secondary changes in corneal opacity which may be seen in long-standing cases include hyaline degeneration, calcareous degeneration, pigmentation and atheromatous ulceration. Treatment: Keratoplasty is the treatment of choice in leucomatous corneal opacities. Optical iridectomy may be performed in cases with central adherent leucomas Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) performed with excimer laser is useful only in superficial (nebular) corneal opacities.",

Arcus senilis (AS), also known as gerontoxon, arcus lipoides or arcus cornealis, is usually an age-related lipid degeneration of the peripheral cornea that forms a light grey or bluish ring. It is the most common peripheral corneal opacity, typically benign, occurring bilaterally and prevalent among the elderly. However, when observed in individuals under 50, termed arcus juvenilis, it may indicate underlying lipid disorder and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, warranting lipid profile screening. Unilateral cases of arcus senilis may indicate contralateral carotid artery stenosis due to decreased ophthalmic blood flow on the ipsilateral side, resulting in protection from forming arcus in the ipsilateral eye. The condition results from the leakage of lipoproteins (phospholipids and cholesterol) from limbal capillaries into the corneal stroma, initiating deposition at the superior and inferior cornea. Over time, the ring progresses circumferentially, sparing a clear corneal zone adjacent to the limbus called the interval of Vogt. The following opacities and rings can resemble arcus senilis: Kayser- Fleischer (KF) ring: A dark brown ring caused by the deposition of excess copper in Descemet's membrane, classically seen in Wilson's disease. It may also be seen in certain chronic, cholestatic liver conditions such as primary biliary cirrhosis. Limbus sign: Caused by dystrophic calcification, seen as a \"milky precipitate\" at the corneal limbus. It can sometimes be confused with AS in the elderly population. Pseudo-gerontoxon: A greyish peri-limbal band of superficial scarring adjacent to a previously inflamed segment of the limbus resembling AS, seen in vernal keratoconjunctivitis.

It results in desquamation of the epithelium leading to multiple painful corneal erosions. Causes of of UV keratitis: The symptoms appear characteristically after a latent period of 4- 5 hours of exposure to ultraviolet light. There is intense burning pain, foreign body sensation, and watering of the eyes. There may be associated marked photophobia and blepharospasm. On slit-lamp examination, corneal epithelium shows a breach in continuity and takes up fluorescein stain. Management comprises cold compresses, lubricant eye drops and bandaging eyes for 24 hours with antibiotic eye ointment and cycloplegic. Avoid local surface topical anaesthesia.

It is a non-inflammatory disease. With the exception of the significant loss of vision, other classic signs of inflammation are not usually present. The asymmetrical thinning and the highly irregular corneal topography often causes significant myopia and irregular astigmatism. Corneal topography is the primary diagnostic tool for KCN detection. Whereas keratoplasty, historically has been the mainstay of treatment for keratoconus, it is now generally reserved for eyes that are unable to achieve functional vision with other surgical or non-surgical modalities and is only considered only as a last resort, in very advanced disease.

Keratoconus is a progressive, non-inflammatory, bilateral corneal ectasia characterized by cone-like steepening due to irregular stromal thinning. This leads to a conical corneal protrusion, significant vision loss, myopia and irregular astigmatism. The available options for the management of keratoconus are highly dependent on the stage of the disease and its progression. If the disease is stabilized (no progression), the emphasis is given to correcting the vision. If the disease is progressing, the emphasis is on slowing (arresting) the progression. Treatment options in moderate-to-advanced keratoconus: Rigid gas-permeable contact lenses and vaulting scleral lenses are the mainstays of vision treatment for moderate to advanced KCN. Their main advantage is the creation of a tear pool between the lens and the cornea, which naturally neutralizes the ocular aberrations associated with keratoconus. (Option B and C) Intra-corneal ring segments (INTACS)- small curved PMMA ring or set of rings that are implanted in the cornea to help flatten corneal curvature to improve vision. Corneal transplantation- Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) and penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) Corneal collagen cross-linking with riboflavin (CXL or C3R) and ultraviolet-A rays arrest the progression of the disease.

It can be primary (rare, in the cornea free of vascularization) or secondary (common, in the vascularized cornea). Option C: Exposure keratopathy results from lagophthalmos (incomplete eyelid closure), causing corneal dryness despite normal tear production. Causes include neuroparalytic conditions (like facial nerve palsy), reduced muscle tone in Parkinsonism, lid scarring, post-blepharoplasty and proptosis. Option D: Neurotrophic keratopathy results from loss of trigeminal nerve innervation to the cornea, affecting both sensation and healing.

The foveal avascular zone (FAZ) is a central area (including foveola and surrounding areas) which contains no blood vessels but is surrounded by a continuous network of capillaries. The macula is a round area at the posterior pole, lying inside the temporal vascular arcades. It measures 5.5 mm in diameter. The inner layers of the macula contain the yellow xanthophyll carotenoid pigments lutein and zeaxanthin in far higher concentrations than the peripheral retina (hence, the full name \"macula lutea\", which means yellow plaque).",

The physiological blind spot is an area of absolute scotoma in the visual field, seen in the region of optic disc. It is due to the absence of photoreceptors (rods and cones) in that region. Enlarged blind spot is seen in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) (Option A), papilledema (Option C), medullated nerve fibers (Option D), optic disc drusen, coloboma of optic disc and myopic disc with a crescent. Optic nerve hypoplasia is the most common congenital optic disc anomaly. There is underdevelopment of the optic disc in the disease and it typically presents with a small disc that is surrounded by a yellowish pigmented ring, called the 'double ring sign'. Option A: In primary open-angle glaucoma(POAG), the optic disc enlargement is seen secondary to increased intra-ocular pressure (IOP) in the eye. Option C: Papilledema is a passive disc swelling seen with raised intracranial pressure. The blind spot is enlarged due to the edema of the optic disc. Option D: Medullated or opaque nerve fibers are the abnormal myelination of nerve fibers of the retina. Normally, optic nerve myelination stops at the level of lamina cribrosa. If the myelination continues beyond the optic disc it leads to the expansion of the blind spot. On ophthalmoscopic examination, these are seen as a whitish patch with feathery margins.",

In sickle cell retinopathy, elevated blood viscosity may occlude venules and arterioles, as well as capillaries. The following fundus findings can be noted as a result: Retinal vascular peripheral non-perfusion Retinal hemorrhages: \"salmon patches,\" \"iridescent spots,\" and \"black sunbursts\" are hallmarks of nonproliferative sickle cell retinopathy. Peripheral retinal neovascularization in a \"sea fan\" configuration is the hallmark of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. They are also described as \"parachute\" lesions. They are most commonly found in the supero-temporal vascular arcades. Angioid streaks (Rupture of Bruch’s membrane) Conjunctival \"comma-shaped\" capillaries and iris atrophy are other ocular findings seen. Complications of sickle cell retinopathy include central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) (occurs due to retinal hypoxia), vitreous hemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment.

The best immediate step in management is ocular massage among the given options. Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) occurs due to obstruction of the retinal artery at the level of lamina cribrosa. Risk factors include heart disease, carotid artery disease, mucormycosis, varicella infection, radiation exposure and trauma. It may be caused by the following: Emboli of carotid artery or cardiac origin are the most common cause of CRAO. Other emboli are cholesterol emboli, calcium emboli, and platelet fibrin emboli Atherosclerosis-related thrombosis Retinal arteritis with obliteration Angiospasm Raised intraocular pressure Thrombophilic disorders Patients often present with sudden painless monocular loss of vision with history of a similar episode that resolved spontaneously (amaurosis fugax). On examination, direct pupillary reflex is absent and relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) is positive. Fundus examination shows marked attenuation of arteries (thread like arteries), interrupted blood flow in vein (cattle track appearance), cherry red spot, severe edema and retinal pallor. A cherry-red spot of the macula is typical and arises in this area because of the absence of ganglion cells at the foveola resulting in the transmission of the normal choroidal color. This in contrast to the surrounding area where intense retinal whitening blocks the transmission of the normal choroidal color. Treatment is to dislodge the emboli by suddenly decreasing the IOP by IV acetazolamide or ocular massage. Ocular massage is considered the most effective method. Other treatment options include IV mannitol, vasodilators (nitrates), fibrinolytic therapy, or laser photodisruption in some cases. In cases of giant cell arteritis, steroids are beneficial.",

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is the result of the accumulation of fluid between NSR and RPE due to a retinal tear. Retinal detachment is the separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is the most common type of retinal detachment. It occurs due to fluid accumulation after a retinal break (tear). High myopia, trauma, pseudophakia, aphakia are predisposing factors. Patients present with photopsia (flashes of light due to vitreoretinal traction at the site of the break), floaters and visual field defect (black curtain/veil in front of the eye). Signs include hypotony, as the liquefied vitreous in the subretinal space is absorbed through the RPE and Shafers sign or tobacco dusting (pigments in the anterior vitreous). The detached retina is convex in configuration. The surface is corrugated with undulations. The most dangerous type of retinal break is horseshoe tear and the most dangerous location of retinal break is the supero-temporal retina. Treatment is by prophylactic laser barrage, scleral buckling, pneumatic retinopexy and pars plana vitrectomy. Other types of retinal detachment are tractional and exudative type: Tractional retinal detachment occurs when fibro-vascular membranes in the vitreous due to long-standing retinal neovascularization exert traction on the retina. It is seen in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, central retinal venous occlusion, Eales disease and ROP. The detached retina is concave in configuration. No breaks are seen. Treatment is with pars plana vitrectomy with endo photocoagulation. Exudative retinal detachment is seen when exudative fluid from the choroid collects in the subretinal space. Patients present with visual field defects, floaters due to vitritis but no photopsia. The detached retina is convex in configuration. The surface is smooth. No break is seen. Shifting fluid is seen.

In CSR, the outer blood-retinal barrier is disrupted. CSR is the serous detachment of the neurosensory retina with focal and multifocal areas of leakage at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), mainly affecting the macular area. That is why the patient who is usually a young male presents with macular symptoms such as blurring of central vision, metamorphopsia. The blood-retina barrier (BRB) is composed of inner and outer barriers. The outer BRB refers to the barrier formed at the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell layer and regulates the movement of solutes and nutrients from the choroid to the sub-retinal space. By contrast, the inner BRB, similar to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is located in the inner retinal microvasculature and comprises the microvascular endothelium, which lines these vessels. The image given below shows the smoke-stack pattern seen in CSR. Amsler grid is used in detecting maculopathy.

They usually cause bilateral hypotonic maculopathy. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is a bleed into the suprachoroidal space that results from the rupture of the posterior ciliary artery. When the bleed is severe it causes extrusion of intraocular contents that is termed as expulsive hemorrhage. It is a rare but dreaded complication of the phacoemulsification procedure. Signs seen in suprachoroidal hemorrhage are: Progressive increase in intraocular pressure Prolapse of iris Loss or partial obscuration of the red reflex In severe cases there can be extrusion of the posterior segment contents into the anterior chamber and through the incision such as vitreous extrusion Immediate treatment involves rapid closure of the incision followed by administration of IOP-lowering medications such as oral acetazolamide and topical or systemic steroids to reduce inflammation.

Stargardt's disease also known as Stargardt macular dystrophy or fundus flavimaculatus is the most common macular dystrophy. It most commonly is inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner caused by a mutation on an adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABCA4) gene. Characterized by macular \"pisciform\" flecks that accumulate at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), sometimes resulting in central macular atrophy early in life. Patients develop a macula with a “beaten bronze” appearance caused by atrophic changes in the RPE. In addition, a \"dark\" or \"silent\" choroid is seen on the fluorescein angiography that appears as a prominent retinal circulation against hypofluorescent choroid. The electroretinogram (ERG) and electro-oculography (EOG) are normal early in the disease but may be reduced in more advanced cases. Of note, the ERG findings do not directly correlate with clinical findings. There is no known proven treatment for this disease. Because ABCA4 plays a role in vitamin A processing in the visual cycle, additional vitamin A is suspected to make the disease worse. The image below shows macular pisciform flecks.

        "explanation": "Silent/Dark choroid on FFA is a feature of Stargardt's disease. The classic feature of 'silent choroid' is due to the masking of background choroidal fluorescence by lipofuscin deposits in the subretinal space. Stargardt disease constitutes the most common type of macular dystrophy. It has mutations in a photoreceptor cell-specific ATP-binding cassette gene (ABC4) that is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The disease usually starts in the juvenile group with progressive central vision loss and color vision loss that occurs due to the atrophy of the macular retinal pigment epithelium with an accumulation of discrete pisciform flecks of lipofuscin. Signs of Stargardt’s disease: Beaten bronze appearance of the macula that is caused by the atrophic changes in the RPE. Silent/Dark choroid on FFA. Visual field testing shows central vision loss. The electroretinogram (ERG) is normal early in the disease but may be reduced in more advanced cases. Fundus flavimaculatus is genetically considered to be a part of the same spectrum as Stargardt's disease with late onset i.e. usually after 40 years of age. Other options: Option B: Best's disease also known as vitelliform macular dystrophy is an autosomal dominant macular dystrophy in which lipofuscin accumulates in the central macula, causing progressive central vision loss. This disease is linked to mutations in the bestrophin (VMD2) gene and they do not exhibit silent choroid on FFA. Findings seen in Best’s disease are: Vitelliform(yolk like) appearance of the fundus Relatively normal ERG results associated with abnormal EOG The given below is the fundus picture of Best's disease showing an egg yolk lesion in the macula. Option C: Age related Macular degeneration(ARMD) also known as senile macular degeneration is a chronic and progressive bilateral degenerative disorder of the macula that affects older individuals >50 yrs. ARMD is classified as dry and wet ARMD where the hallmarks are the presence of drusen and choroidal neovascularization respectively. Drusen are extracellular eosinophilic deposits between RPE and Bruch’s membrane. Clinical features include loss of central vision, distorted vision (lines seen as wavy), and sudden painless loss of vision as seen in wet ARMD. The image below shows Drusens in the macular area in dry macular degeneration. Option D: Cystoid Macular edema (CME) is a collection of fluid between the outer plexiform layer and the inner nuclear layer of the retina following a break in the blood-retinal barrier. In CME on fundoscopy, a honeycomb appearance and on FFA flower petal pattern can be seen. The below image shows the flower petal pattern on FFA as seen in CME.",

Erggelet’s or Berger’s space is at the centre of the hyaloideo-capsular ligament, a potential space between the vitreous and the lens. The canal of Cloquet arises from this space and courses posteriorly through the central vitreous, which is the former site of the hyaloid artery in the embryonic vitreous. Posteriorly, Cloquet’s canal opens into a funnel-shaped region anterior to the optic disc, whch is known as the area of Martegiani.",

        "explanation": "The child should be operated at 4-6 weeks of age. When a child has unilateral or bilateral cataract impairing vision (involving the visual axis), the cataract surgery must be performed before 2-4 months of age. This is because 2-4 months is the critical period for visual maturation and development of the fixation reflex in children. A unilateral cataract is more dangerous than a bilateral cataract because the risk of amblyopia is greater. Under-correction of intraocular lens (IOL) power is needed in children. In children < 2 years of age: In unilateral cases, primary implantation is indicated as soon as the patient is fit for anesthesia, ideally between 2 and 3 months of age. The power is undercorrected by 20%. The earlier the surgery is done, the better the chance that deep amblyopia can be overcome. After the cataract has been aspirated, an elective posterior capsulectomy–anterior vitrectomy is performed. The posterior chamber IOL is inserted through a scleral tunnel, which is prepared in advance. Sulcus implantation is indicated in neonates and infants less than 1 year of age. In children between 2 and 8 years of age: An IOL is implanted but power is undercorrected by 10%. An in-the-bag IOL is chosen for children above 1 year of age because they are less likely to need an IOL exchange. Beyond 8 years, IOL power is the same as the calculated value.",

The treatment of acute bacterial endophthalmitis is intravitreal antibiotics. Endophthalmitis is an intraocular inflammation affecting the inner structures of the eyeball. Acute postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis occurs within 1-7 days after cataract surgery and the most important factor to prevent it is preoperative administration of 5% povidone iodine. The cardinal features of endophthalmitis are pain, swelling of the lid, and a decrease in vision. The patient classically shows inflammation of the eye, corneal edema and a hypopyon due to the pouring of exudates in the vitreous cavity, anterior chamber, and posterior chamber. Once the endophthalmitis sets in it is important to treat all the cases empirically with a combination of antibiotics and steroids from the beginning. The various drugs, routes and surgical management used to treat endophthalmitis are as follows: The mainstay of treatment is intravitreal injections of antibiotics. First choice: Vancomycin 1 mg in 0.1 mL plus ceftazidime 2.25mg in 0.1ml. Second choice:Vancomycin 1 mg in 0.1 mL plus amikacin 0.4mg in 0.1ml. If there is no improvement, a repeat intravitreal injection should be given after 48 hours Topical antibiotics are started immediately and used frequently. Vancomycin (50mg/ml) or cefazolin (50mg/ml) Amikacin (20mg/ml) or tobramycin Systemic antibiotics have a limited role in the treatment but are commonly used in practice. Steroid therapy includes: Intravitreal injection of dexamethasone (0.4mg in 0.1ml) which is started along with antibiotics. Topical dexamethasone (0.1%) Oral steroids such as prednisolone are started after 24 hours of intensive antibiotic therapy. Supportive therapy includes: Cycloplegics such as atropine 1% Anti-glaucoma drugs such as oral acetazolamide or timolol in patients with raised intraocular pressure Pars plana vitrectomy is done if the patient does not improve with the above therapy in 48-72 hours or when the visual acuity is reduced to hand movements near the eye Other options: Option A: Steroids are given in endophthalmitis to reduce the inflammation of the tissues. The preferred route of administration is either by intravitreal injections, topical concentrations or oral route. Intravenous route (option A) of administration of steroids is not used in endophthalmitis. Option B: Systemic administration (intravenous) of antibiotics have a limited role in the treatment but are commonly used in practice as an add on.",

It is a type of after cataract. After cataract, or secondary cataract or posterior capsular opacification, is a late postoperative complication that follows extracapsular extraction of the lens. It is the most common late postoperative complication. It may be caused by residual opaque lens matter or proliferation of left out anterior epithelial cells. Different types of after cataract include: Elschnig’s pearls: The subcapsular epithelial cells proliferate and develop into vacuolated soap bubble like clusters along the posterior capsule. Soemmering’s ring: A peripheral dense ring is formed behind the iris and is enclosed between layers of the capsule. Dense membranous after-cataract: It is formed in the pupillary area impairing the vision. Thin membranous after-cataract: It is thickened posterior capsule. Treatment of after cataract is by Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy of the posterior capsule, which works on the principle of photodisruption, or surgical posterior capsulotomy. Option B: Irvine–Gass syndrome is cystoid macular edema (CME) that develops in post-cataract surgery patients. Though it is mostly clinically insignificant, some cases can present with blurring of vision, one to three months after surgery. In CME, on fundoscopy a honeycomb appearance and on fundus fluorescein angiography(FFA) flower petal pattern can be seen. The below image depicts the flower petal pattern seen on FFA. Option C: Post operative endophthalmitis presents as ocular pain, diminished vision and hypopyon within months to years after the surgery. Fungal endophthalmitis can rarely occur with puff ball exudates in the vitreous cavity. Option D: UGH syndrome is where uveitis, glaucoma and hyphema occurs simultaneously. It is seen commonly with rigid anterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) implantation.",

Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) also known as developmental glaucoma refers to abnormally high intraocular pressure(IOP) which results from the developmental anomaly of the angle of the anterior chamber. It can be classified as: True congenital or newborn glaucoma in which IOP is elevated during intrauterine life and the baby is born with ocular enlargement. Infantile glaucoma: which manifests prior to age 3 years. Juvenile glaucoma: IOP rises between 3 and 16 years of age. Clinical findings include: Blepharospasm Buphthalmos: Large eyeball due to stretching of the globe from elevated IOP prior to the age of 3 years. Corneal enlargement: Corneal haze is due to corneal edema. Blue sclera - due to the shining of the underlying uveal tissue through the thinned-out sclera Haab striae are healed breaks in Descemet's membrane Treatment: Goniotomy - when the angle of the anterior chamber is visible through the clear cornea. Trabeculectomy when the corneal clouding prevents visualization of the angle. Filtration procedures such as Trabeculectomy or combined trabeculectomy with trabeculectomy if the above procedures fail. Glaucoma drainage devices in unresponsive cases. Other options: Option A: Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy of childhood that is seen between 1-2 years. Findings of Retinoblastoma include: Leukocoria (white pupillary reflex)- the most common manifestation Strabismus Painful red eye with secondary glaucoma An endophytic tumor grows into the vitreous as a white mass that may ‘seed’ into the gel. If calcification is present it gives a \"cottage cheese appearance\". An exophytic tumor grows outwards and causes overlying exudative retinal detachment. The image below shows the leucocoria of the left eye. Option C: Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) is an inherited corneal dystrophy that manifests since birth with endothelial degeneration. It appears as diffuse bilateral corneal edema in the absence of elevated IOP. The clinical features of the disease include corneal clouding, visual impairment, and nystagmus. Option D: Megalocornea is a bilateral non-progressive X-linked condition that most commonly affects males. In this condition, the horizontal corneal diameter is 12mm(<2 years) and is 13 mm(>2 years). It is characterized by a clear cornea, normal corneal thickness, and no breaks in the descemet's membrane. Systemic associations of Megalocornea include Marfan's syndrome, Apert syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos, and Down syndrome.",

PSS typically affects young to middle-aged adults. Males are affected more frequently than females. Signs: Slit-lamp biomicroscopy typically shows a few anterior chamber cells and one to several fine white central keratic precipitates. Mydriasis is common; posterior synechiae are not a feature. IOP is typically raised to over 40 mmHg, out of proportion to iritis severity. Gonioscopy shows an open-angle. Treatment: Topical steroids are used to control inflammation, with aqueous suppressants to lower the IOP. Topical or oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents may also be beneficial. Note: In PSS, the rise in IOP is out of proportion to the pain felt. There is often a mild discomfort and pain may even be absent.",

Although neovascular glaucoma occurs as a complication in Eale's disease (Option B) and central retinal artery occlusion (Option C) and long-term use of topical steroid therapy causes steroid-induced glaucoma (Option D) none of them are termed as 100-day glaucoma. CRVO is further classified into two types: Non-ischemic CRVO: occurs secondary to venous stasis.It is the most common type of CRVO of the two. Ischemic CRVO: occurs due to acute occlusion of the central retinal vein. It is also termed as hemorrhagic retinopathy. Ischemic CRVO presents with sudden loss of vision and Relative afferent pupil defect(RAPD). Fundus examination shows massive enlargement of retinal veins and massive retinal hemorrhages giving a \"splashed tomato appearance\". Other findings include cotton wool spots, optic disc edema and neovascularization at the disc and in the periphery. Pathagnomic features of ischemic CRVO that differentiates it from non-ischemic CRVO are: RAPD Reduced amplitude of B-wave on electroretinogram Visual field defects Complications of the disease: Neovascular Glaucoma known as 100 day glaucoma Neovascularisation of iris known as Rubeosis iridis Vitreous hemorrhage Proliferative retinopathy The below-given fundus image is of the \"splashed tomato\" appearance of CRVO. Option B: Eales disease is an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the peripheral retinal veins.It is considered to be a hypersensitivity reaction to the tubercular proteins and it is commonly seen in young males. It is characterized by recurrent vitreous hemorrhage. Complications include: Neovascular glaucoma Proliferative vitreoretinopathy Tractional retinal detachment, Rubeosis iridis Option C: Central retinal artery occlusion(CRAO) is most often caused due to an embolus from an atherosclerotic plaque. It presents as sudden painless loss of vision and amaurosis fugax (transient monocular blindness that is due to ischemia). Fundus examination shows an opaque, milky-white retina with a cherry-red spot. Neovascular glaucoma may occur as a delayed complication of CRAO but it is not termed as 100 day glaucoma. The below image depicts the fundus image seen in CRAO with the cherry red spot. Option D:Steroid induced glaucoma is a type of secondary open angle glaucoma that usually follows weeks-months of topical steroid therapy.",

The disorder is characterized by weakness and fatigability of skeletal muscles where the weakness increases during repeated use and may improve following rest. Ptosis and diplopia are common initial complaints due to early involvement of the lids and extraocular muscles (EOMs). Of them, Ptosis is a more common manifestation than diplopia. Ptosis in myasthenia gravis is insidious, bilateral, and frequently asymmetrical. Investigations of myasthenia gravis include: Ice pack test -This tests for a transient improvement of the ptotic eyelid on placing an ice pack for 2 minutes, as the cold inhibits the breakdown of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase. Tensilon (Edrophonium) test - This tests for a transient improvement in the weakness on administration of a short-acting anticholinesterase such as edrophonium. Antibody testing - for Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies, MuSK protein antibodies helps support a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis.",

The ptosis is so severe that it obstructs the pupillary area (visual axis) with the risk of sensory deprivation amblyopia. This warrants immediate treatment to reduce the bulk of the tumor. Capillary hemangioma regresses spontaneously very often. It may be managed by oral propranolol, oral prednisolone, or intralesional steroid. Indications for treatment of patients with capillary hemangioma with pharmacologic therapy are: Visual symptoms (amblyopia, astigmatism, occlusion, strabismus) Cosmesis Optic nerve compression Exposure keratopathy",

Pleomorphic adenoma, or benign mixed tumor, presents commonly in middle age as a slowly progressive painless swelling in the upper outer quadrant of the eyelid. The bone is usually not invaded in these tumors. They are treated by surgical removal along with their intact pseudo-capsule. Malignant tumors of the lacrimal gland such as adenoid cystic carcinoma (option A), mucoepidermoid carcinoma (option C) and malignant mixed tumor (option D) generally occur in the elderly with a short history of appearance, rapid progression and pain. These tumors also present in the upper eyelid and are known to invade the adjacent bones. Radical surgical procedures and high dose radiotherapy are necessary for the removal of the tumor. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is the most common malignant epithelial tumor of the lacrimal gland. Both malignant and benign tumors are known to push the eyeball downwards and inwards while restricting the upwards and outwards movement of the eyeball. The most common epithelial tumors, in order of frequency, are as follows: Benign mixed tumor (BMT), also known as a pleomorphic adenoma (PA) Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) Pleomorphic adenocarcinoma (ACA) Mucoepidermoid carcinoma Orbit Anatomy and Ocular Injuries",

Treatment of thyroid ophthalmopathy: Non-surgical management Systemic steroids- These form the mainstay of the treatment. Oral, intravenous or orbital steroid injections can be used depending upon patient indications. (Option B) Radiotherapy- Orbital radiation given in a dose of 2000 rads over 10-14 days can be considered in cases where steroids are ineffective/ contraindicated. It is contraindicated in cases of extensive thyroid eye disease as it can worsen it. (Option A) Teprotumumab (IGF-1R inhibitor)- is used for persistent, corticosteroid-resistant disease or non-response to first-line treatment. It is effective in reducing proptosis and clinical activity in patients. Surgical management: Orbital decompression- It may be required for an acutely progressive optic neuropathy and/or exposure keratitis, in patients not responding to aggressive steroid therapy. (Option D) Extraocular muscle surgery- Inferior rectus recession is the most commonly performed surgery. These should be performed after the orbital decompression since decompression may alter extraocular motility. Extraocular muscle surgery helps in achieving a binocular single vision in the primary gaze and reading position. Eyelid surgery- This is done to correct eyelid retraction. Various surgeries that can be performed are mullerectomy, levator recession/ disinsertion, scleral grafts with LPS recession, recession of lower eyelid retractors, and blepharoplasty.",

In the given image, the above image refers to the examiner's view and the below image refers to the patient's view. The Maddox rod can be used to test for horizontal and vertical deviations, and when used in conjunction with another Maddox rod, for cyclo-deviations. Interpretation: To test for horizontal deviations, the Maddox rod is placed in front of one eye (for this example, the left eye) with the cylinders in the horizontal direction. The patient fixates a point source of light and then sees a vertical red line with the left eye and white dot/light with the right eye: Orthophoria: if the light/dot superimposes the line. Exo-deviation/exophoria: In this example, light/dot is on the left side of the line (rod placed on eft eye) Eso-deviation/esophoria: if the light was on the right side of the line (rod placed on left eye) Maddox Rod Test involves the use of a Maddox rod and the Maddox tangent scale. It uses a specially constructed device, consisting of a series of parallel cylinders, that converts a point source of light into a line image. The optical properties of the cylinders cause the streak of light to be situated 90° to the orientation of the parallel cylinders. In the image given below, the interpretation of the result is based on how the patient visualizes it. It would appear to be crossed to the patient.

The main types of procedure in squint surgery are as follows: Weakening to decrease the effective strength of action of a muscle. Recession slackens a muscle by moving it away from its insertion. It can be performed on any muscle except the superior oblique. Disinsertion (or myectomy) involves detaching a muscle from its insertion without reattachment. It is most commonly used to weaken an overacting inferior oblique muscle. Posterior fixation suture: The principle of this (Faden) procedure is to suture the muscle belly to the sclera posteriorly so as to decrease the pull of the muscle in its field of action without affecting the eye in the primary position. Strengthening, to enhance the pull of a muscle. Resection shortens a muscle to enhance its effective pull. It is suitable only for the rectus muscle. Tucking of a muscle or its tendon is usually confined to the enhancement of the action of the superior oblique muscle. Advancement of the muscle nearer to the limbus can be used to enhance the action of a previously recessed rectus muscle. Vector adjustment procedures have the primary aim of altering the direction of muscle action. Transposition refers to the relocation of one or more extraocular muscles to substitute for the action of an absent or severely deficient muscle. The most common indication is severe lateral ectus weakness due to acquired palsy of the 6th cranial nerve palsy.",

        "explanation": "Right superior rectus palsy is the cause for the given clinical scenario. The three-step test, also known as the Parks-Bielschowsky three-step test, is a diagnostic test used to identify which muscle is paralyzed in the case of an acquired hypertropia. This method uses the cover-uncover test, with or without the Maddox rod to measure the amount of deviation in different head positions. The three-step test may also be used to diagnose the less common inferior oblique or vertical rectus muscle palsy. It is designed for the diagnosis of a single paretic vertical muscle and is unreliable when there are multiple paretic muscles or in restrictive strabismus. This test may also help in identifying if a superior rectus palsy is true or simulated in a patient with an inhibitional palsy of the contralateral antagonist. Using the three-step test in the above clinical scenario: Step 1. Which eye is hypotrophic? The eye hypotrophic in the primary position is the right eye. The paretic muscles can be right eye elevator or left eye depressor. Right superior rectus Right inferior oblique Left inferior rectus Left superior oblique Step 2.Does the hypotropia increase in the right gaze or left gaze? The hypotropia increases in right gaze. Therefore, the paretic muscle must be either (1) one of the muscles whose primary action is elevating the right eye on the right gaze, or (2) one of the muscles whose primary action is depressing the left eye in the right gaze. The left inferior oblique and the right superior rectus both have a primary action of elevation in right gaze. Therefore, one of these muscles could be the paretic muscle. Likewise, the left superior oblique and the right inferior rectus have a primary action of depression in the right gaze and could be paretic. But since the left inferior oblique and the right inferior rectus did not meet step 1, they can be eliminated from the possible paretic muscles. This leaves us: Left superior oblique Right superior rectus Step 3. Does the hypotropia increase in the right head tilt or left head tilt? The hypotropia increases in the right head tilt. If the deviation increases on right head tilt and decreases on left head tilt, as it does in this example patient, then the right superior rectus is implicated as the paretic culprit.

However, an abrupt infarction or hemorrhage of a pre-existing pituitary adenoma will lead to rapid progression of the visual defect. Heteronymous hemianopia is the loss of half of the visual field on different sides in both eyes. It is separated into two categories: Binasal hemianopia – the loss of the fields surrounding the nose Bitemporal hemianopia – the loss of the fields closest to the temples.

Homonymous hemianopia involves vision loss on the same side of the visual field in both eyes. This type of visual field loss is suggestive of a lesion posterior to the optic chiasma in the visual pathway. Complete homonymous hemianopia involves the complete visual hemifields of both eyes and can occur with any large enough lesion posterior to the optic chiasma. Visual field examination alone cannot further localize the lesion in such cases. Incomplete homonymous hemianopia is due to smaller lesions in the visual pathway posterior to the optic chiasm. They are further divided into congruous and incongruous depending on the extent to which the defects in the two half fields match each other exactly. Because of a relative disorder among axon bundles in the immediate post-chiasmal region, diseases in this location produce rather incongruent lesions. More posteriorly, the axon bundles of the corresponding areas of the two hemifields are more closely aligned and hence, lesions of the occipital cortex produce congruous homonymous hemianopia while incongruous homonymous hemianopia is more likely seen with optic tract lesions.",

Marcus Gunn pupil also known as relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) is the earliest sign of optic nerve disease as seen in optic nerve neuritis or primary open-angle glaucoma(POAG). RAPD is caused due to a defect in the afferent pathway (optic nerve) of the pupillary light reflex in one eye. It is diagnosed by the swinging flashlight test where the flashlight is swung to and fro, and the pupillary response is observed. Normally, both pupils constrict when any one eye is stimulated (due to direct and consensual light reflex). In the presence of RAPD, both pupils will abnormally dilate when the affected eye is stimulated. This paradoxical response of the pupil to light is called Marcus Gunn pupil. Causes of RAPD: Optic nerve lesions (e.g.All types of optic neuritis, glaucoma) Optic tract lesions (e.g., infarction) Severe retinal disease (e.g., central retinal artery occlusion, extensive retinal detachment) Maculopathy (macular degeneration ) Other options: Option B: Adie tonic pupil is a unilateral dilated pupil with light-near dissociation due to postganglionic parasympathetic pupillomotor nerve supply damage. In these patients the light reflex is absent and the accomdation (near) reflex is sluggish. It is commonly seen in young females and is associated with absent knee jerk. Option C: Argyll Robertson pupils are bilateral small pupils with light-near dissociation. It is commonly seen in patients with neurosyphilis. In these patients the pupillary reflex is absent but the accommodation reflex is present (ARP). Option D: Hutchinson's pupil is a clinical sign where the pupil on the side of an intracranial mass lesion is dilated and unreactive to light, due to compression of the oculomotor nerve on that side.",

Among the given options, 1% pilocarpine and 0.1% pilocarpine can be used to differentiate fixed dilated pupil.

Pupillary constriction to 0.1% pilocarpine diagnoses Adie's pupil (due to denervation hypersensitivity). Application of 0.1% pilocarpine shows no response in other conditions or in the normal eye. Example: A person presenting with dilated pupil following accidental application or inadvertent rubbing of atropine or antimuscarinic alkaloids from wild plants into the eye will not constrict in response to topical application of 1% Pilocarpine. But the patient showing dilation due to 3rd nerve palsy shows pupillary constriction in response to pupillary instillation of 1% pilocarpine. Note: Cocaine and phenylephrine are used in anisocoria that is greater in the dark to diagnose Horner’s syndrome.

Hypochromic heterochromia (lighter color iris on affected side); in congenital cases. Mild ptosis (Mullers muscle is affected) Reduced ipsilateral sweating (only if the lesion is below the superior cervical ganglion) Pharmacological tests Hydroxyamphetamine and adrenaline may be used to differentiate a preganglionic from a postganglionic lesion. Phenylepherine (1%) Result: In an established (10 days) postganglionic lesion, the Horner pupil will dilate and ptosis may be temporarily relieved. A central or preganglionic Horner pupil and a normal pupil will not dilate or will dilate minimally. Explanation: In postganglionic Horner's syndrome, the dilator pupillae muscle develops denervation hypersensitivity to adrenergic neurotransmitters due to its dysfunctional local motor nerve. Apraclonidine (0.5% or 1.0%) Result: A Horner pupil will dilate, but a normal pupil is essentially unaffected. Explanation: Alpha-1 receptors are upregulated in the denervated dilator pupillae. Cocaine (4%) is instilled into both eyes Result: The normal pupil will dilate, but the Horner pupil will not. Explanation: Cocaine blocks the re-uptake of noradrenaline secreted at the postganglionic nerve ending, which accumulates and causes dilatation of a normal pupil. In Horner's syndrome, there is no noradrenaline being secreted, so cocaine has no effect.",

The etiology of diabetic neuropathy is hyperglycemia-induced damage to nerve cells and neuronal ischemic change due to microvascular angiopathy. Involvement of the third cranial nerve is most common and it often presents with early features of ptosis and diplopia with pupil sparing. The involvement of levator palpebrae superioris muscle of the eyelid manifests as ptosis and the involvement of extraocular muscles such as medial rectus,inferior rectus and inferior oblique presents as opthalmoplegia with diplopia.

There are 3 types of optic neuritis: papillitis, neuroretinitis, and retrobulbar neuritis. The common causes of retrobulbar neuritis include demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO or Devic's disease). Clinically, optic neuritis is characterized by sudden, progressive visual loss. Ocular movements are painful in retrobulbar neuritis and painless in papillitis and neuroretinitis. Glowing sensations known as phosphenes may be induced with sound or movement. Color vision may also be impaired. On examination, Marcus Gunn pupil or relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) is usually noted due to asymmetric involvement. The most common visual field defect is a central or centrocecal scotoma.

Neuromyelitis optica also known as Devic's disease is an autoimmune demyelinating disease in which antibodies are formed against Aquaporin 4 present in the cell membranes of Astrocytes. It is characterized by the findings of unilateral or bilateral optic neuritis developing within a few weeks of transverse myelitis(demyelination of the spinal cord). The disease may be monophasic or recurrent. Diagnostic Criteria for Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD): Diagnostic Criteria for NMOSD associated with AQP4-IgG At least 1 core clinical characteristic A positive test for AQP4-IgG using the best available detection method (cell-based assay) Exclusion of alternative diagnoses Core Clinical Characteristics: Optic neuritis is usually bilateral and causes severe visual loss. Acute myelitis- may be severe, transverse and typically longitudinally extensive involving three or more contiguous vertebral segments. Area postrema syndrome: episodes of otherwise unexplained hiccups or nausea or vomiting Acute brainstem syndrome Symptomatic narcolepsy associated with NMOSD-typical diencephalic MRI lesions For acute cases of NMO, high-dose glucocorticoids or plasma exchange is used. Mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, and glucocorticoids with azathioprine are used for prophylaxis against relapses. The FDA has approved satralizumab, a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of NMO spectrum disorder with AQP4 antibody positivity. Eculizumab, a complement inhibitor, and inebilizumab, a B-cell depletion agent, are two more new drugs that have recently been approved for use in NMO attack prevention. A history of transverse myelitis with optic neuritis(decreased visual acuity) rules out Multiple sclerosis(option D). It is an autoimmune inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the CNS that affects both upper motor neurons (UMN) and lower motor neurons (LMN) with involvement of sensory system, ocular system and bowel and bladder function.

        "explanation": "In internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) the lesion is at the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). In INO, there is impaired adduction on the ipsilateral side of the lesion, and nystagmus on abduction on the contralateral side. When the gaze is initiated in the motor cortex, the horizontal gaze center or the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) generates the eye movements. The PPRF has two outputs. The first is to the ipsilateral 6th cranial nerve nucleus which causes abduction of the ipsilateral eye. The second output is to the contralateral MLF which sends an impulse to the contralateral 3rd cranial nerve nucleus causing contralateral adduction. These two outputs from PPRF lead to conjugate movement of the eyes to the same side. Therefore, a lesion in the right MLF leads to failure of the right eye adduction. The left eye, however, abducts normally. This is called internuclear ophthalmoplegia. The following image shows the pathway for horizontal eye movements as described above.",

        "correct_option": "a",
        "explanation": "Horizontal gaze palsy can occur due to a lesion in parapontine reticular formation (PPRF). Horizontal gaze: It involves 2 muscles- the ipsilateral lateral rectus and the contralateral medial rectus. Center for this pathway is parapontine reticular formation (PPRF). From here, they move to the ipsilateral 6th nerve nucleus. Next, they pass through the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) to the contralateral medial rectus subnucleus. Lesions affecting the abducens nuclei will also cause ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy, because of damage to motor neurons and internuclear neurons originating from the nuclei. Lesions involving the PPRF will lead to horizontal gaze palsy, as PPRF acts as a relay centre that connects the frontal eye fields in the cerebral cortex to the abducens nuclei. Conjugate horizontal gaze palsy can also be caused by lesion(s) involving both the abducens motor fibres and the MLFs preceding the abducens nucleus. Bilateral horizontal gaze palsy will be caused if lesion(s) involve both abducens nuclei or bilateral PPRF. Isolated damage to the MLFs will cause the classic INO where eye abduction is preserved, however, the ipsilateral eye will not be able to be adducted on conjugate horizontal gaze. Conjugate eye movements Binocular movements in which the eyes move synchronously and symmetrically in the same direction. Main types Saccades: They are fast movements controlled by the contralateral frontal lobe. Pursuits: They are slow following movements controlled by the ipsilateral occipital lobe. Image: The Horizontal gaze pathway Lesions in this pathway Horizontal gaze palsy: Due to lesion in the PPRF of the same side Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO): Caused by lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) One and a half syndrome: Caused by lesions in both MLF and PPRF of the same side Vertical gaze palsy Center is located in the rostral interstitial nucleus of the dorsal midbrain (riMLF).

When a further mutagenic event (\"second hit\" according to the \"two-hit\" hypothesis proposed by Knudson) affects the second allele, the cell may then undergo malignant transformation. A large majority of these children develop bilateral and multifocal tumors. In sporadic cases, both RB alleles must undergo somatic mutation in the same retinoblast (two hits). Familial retinoblastoma patients also have a predisposition to non-ocular cancers because of the presence of the mutation in all cells, such as pinealoblastoma (usually before the age of 5 years), osteosarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas, and melanomas.

From the eye movements in other positions, it can be seen that adduction and elevation are absent and depression is reduced in the left eye. All of these findings are indicative of oculomotor nerve palsy. 3rd Cranial nerve(oculomotor nerve) palsy presents with: Ptosis due to weakness of levator palpebrae superioris muscle (LPS) Abduction and depression in the primary position (down and out) due to unopposed action of the lateral rectus(6th nerve supply) and superior oblique muscles(4th nerve supply) Dilated pupil and defective accommodation due to parasympathetic palsy (involvement of Edinger Westphal parasympathetic supply) Limited adduction, elevation and depression due to ipsilateral paralysis of medial rectus, inferior oblique and inferior rectus . Option A: Trochlear(4th cranial) nerve palsy presents with superior oblique muscle paralysis. Clinical findings of trochlear nerve palsy include: Hypertropia (elevation) in the primary positio Extorsion that is greatest in abductio Compensatory head posture with contralateral face turn and head tilt with chin slightly depressed. This position is assumed to avoid Diplopia. Limitation of depressio Normal abduction and elevation. The below given image depicts 4th cranial nerve palsy. Option B: Lateral rectus palsy is seen in cases of isolated Abducens nerve palsy. These patients present with esotropia/convergent squint in primary position with limitation of abduction on the side of the lesion. This is due to unopposed action of the medial rectus muscle in the affected eye. There is also a compensatory head turn towards the side of the lesion to reduce the symptom of Diplopia. The adduction is normal in lateral rectus palsy. Option C: Internuclear opthalmoplegia occurs following an injury to the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). A unilateral lesion to the MLF leads to the failure of adduction in the ipsilateral eye with a normal abduction of the contralateral eye. The below given image depicts the pathogenesis of Inter nuclear opthalmoplegia in detail.",

A bright light is then shone into the eye for 15 seconds, and the patient is asked to read the line again, and the time taken to recover is noted. The test is repeated with the other eye. In normal people and in patients with optic nerve disease, the recovery time is not affected. Whereas, in patients with macular disease the recovery time is prolonged and is usually more than one-third of the normal recovery time.

It is a form of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) to increase aqueous drainage. Ex-PRESS glaucoma implant is a small stainless steel device. It is inserted under a scleral flap during a modified trabeculectomy. Complications such as hypotony are lower than with standard trabeculectomy. Glaucoma drainage devices are devices that allow aqueous outflow by establishing communication between the anterior chamber and sub-Tennon's space/sub-conjunctival space. While these devices were traditionally reserved for high-risk patients, or after trabeculectomy had failed, they are becoming increasingly popular. The commonly used devices are as follows: Shunts using episcleral explants Ahmed glaucoma valve: Silicone Molteno implant - Polypropylene plate and silicone plate Baerveldt implant - Silicone Mini-shunts Ex-Press™ Mini-Shunt: Stainless stee iStent® - Titanium",

It is a hand-held electronic contact tonometer (a modified version of the older Mackay–Marg tonometer). Besides portability, its main advantage is the ability to measure IOP reasonably accurately in eyes with distorted or edematous corneas and through a soft contact lens. Types of tonometry: Indentation tonometry- Reading depends on scleral rigidity, e.g., Schiotz tonometer Applanation tonometry- Based on the amount of force needed to flatten or applanate a known area of the cornea, Imbert–Fick principle. This is further divided into two types - Fixed force: IOP is proportional to the area, e.g., Maklakov, Barraquer Fixed area and variable force: IOP is proportional to force. The most reliable is Goldmann. Self-measurement: Rebound Non-contact type: Pulse Air, Air-Puff Irregular cornea: Tonopen, MacKay–Marg Recent tonometers: Pascals tonometer (dynamic contour tonometry [DCT]): Contact; used for post-LASIK IOP measurement.
