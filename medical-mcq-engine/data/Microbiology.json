They synthesize and accumulate enzymes and metabolic intermediates required for multiplication. Thus, there is no increase in cell number but cell size increases. Maximum cell size is obtained towards the end of this phase. Log or exponential phase (B) - The bacteria start dividing and their numbers increase exponentially with time. Cells are smaller and stain uniformly. The growth rate is constant. Stationary phase (C) - There is depletion of nutrients and accumulation of toxic products. Thus, cell division reduces and a state of equilibrium is attained, where the number of new cells formed equals the number that die. Growth rate is zero. Sporulation occurs during this phase. Many bacteria produce secondary metabolic products such as exotoxins and antibiotics. Death phase or the phase of decline (D) - Growth rate is negative. The population decreases due to cell death from nutritional exhaustion, toxin accumulation and the action of autolytic enzymes. Involution forms are common.",

Acid-fast bacteria (like MTB) in a stained Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear appear bright red against a blue background. Steps involved in ZN staining are: Place the sample on slide evenly spread it with rotational movement Air-dry the slide and fix it by passing it over a flame Apply carbol fuschin stain and heat to fix it. Wash with water to remove excess stain Decolourise with alcohol Apply Methylene blue/Malachite green stain Wash with water to remove excess stain View under the microscope Kinyoun modified the classical ZN staining such that heat fixing is not required. It is called the cold method. It involves increasing the concentration of phenol acid and the duration of staining. The slide is then washed with water and decolourized with acid alcohol. Counterstaining with Loeffler's methylene blue or malachite green is done for a minute and viewed under a microscope. Acid-fast bacteria in a stained smear appear bright red against a blue background. The image attached below summarizes the steps. Option A: It depicts the order of Gram staining, which was discovered by Hans Christian Gram in 1884. Primary staining with para-rosaniline dye (crystal violet, methyl violet or gentian violet). Application of dilute solution of iodine. Decolorisation with an organic solvent (ethanol, acetone, aniline). Counterstaining with the dye of contrasting colour (carbol fuchsin, safranine, neutral red). Option B: It includes the steps for performing Albert's stain which is used for detected Corynebacterium diphtheriae. A heavy smear of the bacterial isolate is prepared on a glass slide and allowed to dry without fixing. Albert’s stain is applied for (3-4) minutes. Then it is washed with water and Albert’s iodine is applied for one minute. Wash with water and let dry with blotting paper. Examine the slide under oil immersion. Corynebacterium diphtheriae are slender bacilli with an arrangement resembling the letters V or L. They have metachromatic granules at the poles of bacilli which are also called polar bodies, volutin, or Babes-Ernst granules. Albert staining is useful in the demonstration of metachromatic granules. The presence of metachromatic granules helps to distinguish C.diphtheriae from diphtheroids which lack them.

        "explanation": "The immunity conferred to a neonate receiving the BCG vaccine is artificial active immunity, as it involves administering a live attenuated vaccine form of Mycobacterium bovis to stimulate an adaptive immune response and develop antibodies, establishing long-term immunity. Types of adaptive immunity: Natural active immunity: It results from either a clinical or an inapparent infection by a microbe. Artificial active immunity: It is the resistance induced by vaccines which are preparations o killed or attenuated microorganisms or their products. Natural passive immunity: It is the immunity passively transferred from mother to baby. In human infants, maternal antibodies are transmitted predominantly through the placenta, while in animals such as pigs, the transfer of antibodies occurs mainly through the colostrum. Artificial passive immunity: It is the resistance passively transferred to a recipient by the administration of antibodies. Hyperimmune sera of animal or human origin, convalescent sera, and pooled human immunoglobulin are used for this purpose. Combined immunization: A combination of the active and passive methods of immunization is used. Examples of the above types of immunity: Note: Adoptive immunity is immunity in which immunologically competent lymphocytes are injected. The transfer factor is composed of these immunologically competent lymphocytes. It can passively transfer cell-mediated immunity against those antigens to which the donor is sensitive.

This is because the antigen combines with any pre-existing antibody and lowers its level in circulation. It is seen at the beginning of the active immune response. Secondary type response: If an individual who has been actively immunized against an antigen experiences the same antigen subsequently, the immune response occurs more quickly and abundantly than during the first encounter.

PRRs activate pro-inflammatory pathways, promote phagocytosis in cells like macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells, and may act as secreted proteins binding directly to pathogens. Based on the localization and functional characteristics, PRRs are classified as: Membrane-bound PRRs: Toll-like receptors (TLR)- detect microbial carbohydrates and lipoproteins (Option B) C-type lectin receptors (CLR)- detect mannose residues Cytoplasmic (intracellular) PRRs: Nucleotide oligomerization (NOD)-like receptors (NLR) - NOD1 and NOD2 - Detects bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans (Option A) RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) - detect viral RNA (Option C) Secreted PRRs On the contrary, BMP receptors are multifunctional transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors that belong to the transforming growth factor  (TGF-) superfamily, regulating cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis with no role in pattern recognition. Also, there are no receptors termed \"BMP-like receptors\".

In contrast to regular antigens which bind to the binding groove on T cells, superantigens bind outside the groove directly to the lateral aspect of the TCR  chain. This leads to a massive release of cytokines and polyclonal activation of T cells. Clinically, this manifests as fever, hypotension, and skin exfoliation.

        "explanation": "Affinity maturation is due to somatic hypermutation. Affinity maturation is the process by which antibodies gain increased affinity, avidity, and anti-pathogen activity. It is a result of somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin genes in B cells, coupled to selection for antigen binding. This process occurs in the germinal centers and proceeds for weeks after acute infection or vaccination, or for many cycles during chronic infection. The resulting antibodies can be highly mutated from their germline-encoded counterparts, with increases of several orders of magnitude in affinity for antigen compared to the corresponding naïve B cell receptors (BCRs). Other options: Option A: Isotype switching, also known as class switch recombination, is a process where the constant region of the antibody heavy chain is changed, leading to a switch in the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG). This process is crucial for the functional properties of antibodies but is not directly involved in affinity maturation. Option C: mRNA splicing is a cellular process that involves the removal of introns and the joining of exons to generate mature mRNA. While this process is essential for the production of functional antibodies, it is not specifically associated with affinity maturation. Affinity maturation primarily occurs through somatic hypermutation. Option D: VDJ rearrangement is the process by which the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes are assembled from gene segments (V, D, and J segments). This process contributes to the diversity of antibodies but is distinct from affinity maturation. Affinity maturation occurs after VDJ rearrangement and is driven by somatic hypermutation in the variable regions.",

NK cells express CD16 and CD56. Their action is inhibited when MHC I is expressed on normal cells. This prevents NK Cells from killing normal cells. In the presence of a viral infection or malignancy, MHC expression of a cell is reduced. Thus, NK cells get activated and kill virus-infected/tumor cells. NK cells also secrete cytokines (IFN-) which activate macrophages (option B) for destruction of ingested microbes.

The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to a few hours after exposure to the allergen.The primary mediators are histamine and serotonin. The secondary mediators are prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Clinically, anaphylaxis can present with a combination of symptoms that typically include: Respiratory Symptoms: Patients often experience wheezing and respiratory distress due to bronchoconstriction. Other signs may include shortness of breath, coughing, and a feeling o tightness in the chest. Skin Symptoms: Urticaria (hives) and angioedema (swelling of the skin and mucous membranes) are common. These skin reactions usually develop rapidly, often within minutes to two hours o exposure to the allergen. Cardiovascular Symptoms: Hypotension (low blood pressure) is a key indicator of anaphylaxis. Patients may also experience tachycardia (increased heart rate) and, in severe cases, shock. Gastrointestinal Symptoms: Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps can occur, particularly if the anaphylaxis is triggered by food allergens. Neurological Symptoms: Dizziness, lightheadedness, or loss of consciousness can occur due to the sudden drop in blood pressure and reduced oxygen supply to the brain.",

A higher nitroblue test score indicates that the cell is more efficient in producing ROS. In chronic granulomatous disease, there is an NADPH oxidase defect. Hence, the phagocyte cannot produce reactive oxygen species or radicals required for bacterial killing, which results in recurrent infections. Here, the leukocytes fail to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium during phagocytosis. Hence, a negative test (NBT remains colourless to yellow) is seen in CGD.

The hyper-IgE syndromes are rare primary immunodeficiency syndromes characterized by recurrent severe staphylococcal abscesses of the skin, lungs, and other sites, eczema, eosinophilia, and marked elevation of serum IgE levels. They occur in 2 forms: Autosomal dominant - involves mutations in the gene encoding STAT-3 (also known as Job syndrome) Autosomal recessive - involves mutations in DOCK8. In Job syndrome, mutation of the STAT3 gene leads to IgE overproduction without modulation. Loss of modulation is due to the absence of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma. Lack of IL-6 leads to deficiency of CD4 + Th17 cells, making them susceptible to various infections. It usually presents as a triad of atopic dermatitis, recurrent skin staphylococcal infections, and recurrent pulmonary infections that occur early in childhood. The eczematoid rash affects the scalp and face, gets superinfected with Staphylococcus aureus and forms cold abscesses. Candida infections are common. Recurrent staphylococcal pneumonia with pneumatocoeles is also commonly seen. Other non-immunological features are: Dysmorphic facial features that appear in early adolescence and are absent in the autosomal recessive form Craniosynostosis Arnold-Chiari type 1 Hyperextensible joints Scoliosis Pathological fractures Retention of primary teeth Vascular complications Ocular complications Diagnosis is based on measurements of serum IgE levels >2000U/mL where IgA, IgG and IgM concentrations are generally normal, in adjunct with the clinical features seen in Job syndrome. It is associated with peripheral blood eosinophilia. The treatment primarily focuses on preventing infections through the use of antimicrobials, including antibiotics and antifungals, along with immunoglobulin replacement therapy.",

Hyper-IgM syndrome is a primary immunodeficiency disorder that is inherited as: X-linked form (most common): CD40 ligand (CD40L) defect on T-helper cells, preventing B-cell activation, class switching and memory cells formation. Autosomal recessive form: Affect CD40 on B-cells or enzymes like activation-induced cytidine eaminase (AID), a DNA-editing enzyme expressed in B cells. The B-cell response to T-independent antigen is unaffected. CD40–CD40L interactions are also required for IL-12 secretion. So, defects in this pathway result in increased susceptibility to intracellular pathogens. In normal immune response, B-cells expressing CD40 on their surface interact with CD40L on T-cells to undergo class switching from IgM to various other classes (IgG, IgA, IgE) depending on the type of antigen. Thus, failure of this class switching leads to an increase in IgM with extremely low levels of IgG and no IgA or IgE. Clinical features include recurrent pyogenic infections caused by low levels of opsonizing IgG antibodies. Patients are highly susceptible to pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii. The illustration below depicts the defects in components of T-cell & B-cell interactions that give rise to primary immunodeficiency. Other options: Option A: Defective cytokine signalling in T-cell precursors is seen in X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). It is caused by a mutation in the common -chain (c) subunit of cytokine receptors. This defect disrupts Interleukins (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21) signalling, leading to low T-cell and NK-cell numbers. Although B-cell numbers are normal, these are non-functional due to the absence of T-cell help, resulting in impaired antibody synthesis. Option B: Mutation in the STAT3 gene is seen in an autosomal dominant form of Hyper IgE syndrome (also known as Job syndrome), characterized by recurrent staphylococcal skin abscesses, recurrent pulmonary infections often with pneumatoceles and atopic dermatitis. Here, serum IgE levels are markedly elevated (due to IgE overproduction without modulation), and IgA, IgG and IgM concentrations are generally normal. Option D: A defect in NADPH oxidative pathway is seen in chronic granulomatous disease, leading to failure of the oxidative burst in phagocytes, predisposing individuals to catalase-positive microbial infections.",

Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is characterized by deficient cell-mediated immunity to candida, usually due to defects in IL-17. Mutations affecting the IL-17 signalling pathway lead to impaired IL-17 production and defective TH17 function, compromising mucosal and skin defence mechanisms and increasing susceptibility to fungal infections. Patients develop persistent fungal infections of the skin, nails, oral cavity, and genitals, primarily caused by Candida species. Despite chronic mucocutaneous involvement, these patients typically do not develop invasive candidiasis. A key feature of CMC is the absence of delayed hypersensitivity to candida antigens. However, circulating antibodies to them are present in high titres. They do not show increased susceptibility to other infections but may develop endocrinopathies, autoimmune disorders, and vascular abnormalities.

Synergohymenotropic (synergo - working together, hymenotropic - form pores) toxins are a family of bicomponent toxins that act through the synergistic activity of 2 non-associated secretory proteins - class F and class S proteins. Gamma hemolysin has two components necessary for its hemolytic action. It is encoded by three genes HlgA and HlgC (belonging to class S) and HlgB (belonging to class F), resulting in 2 pairs of class S and F components - HlgA and HlgB, or HlgC and HlgB. Panton-Valentine Leucocidin is composed of two components- S and F - encoded by two contiguous and cotranscribed genes, lukS-PV and lukF-PV. It is associated with the majority of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA).",

Penicillin resistance in Staphylococci most commonly occurs due to bacterial production of beta-lactamase, which inactivates penicillins by splitting their beta-lactam ring. These enzymes are inducible and are plasmid-mediated. They confer resistance to penicillin G, ampicillin, piperacillin etc. The genetic transfer of antibiotic resistance can occur in the following ways: Transformation: After death or cell lysis, some bacteria release their DNA into the environment. Other bacteria, generally of the same species, can come into contact with these free DNA fragments, take them up and incorporate them into their DNA by recombination. Transduction: This method involves the transfer of DNA, episome or plasmid from one bacterium to another with the use of a bacteriophage. Conjugation: This mechanism requires the presence of a special plasmid called the F plasmid that codes for the sex pilus. It is the most common method of transfer of antibiotic resistance in most other bacteria. Note: Change in penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) and production of -lactamases are modes of penicillin resistance seen in S. aureus but the question asks for methods of transfer of drug resistance.",

The incubation period from ingestion of contaminated food to the onset of symptoms in food-borne botulism is usually 8–36 h but can be as long as 10 days and is dose-dependent. The clinical syndrome of botulism consists of bilateral cranial-nerve palsies that may progress to respiratory compromise, a bilateral descending flaccid paralysis of voluntary muscles, and even death. Cranial nerve deficits may manifest as some of the following: diplopia dysarthria dysphonia ptosis ophthalmoplegia facial paralysis and impaired gag reflex The absence of cranial nerve palsies makes botulism highly unlikely, as does a lack of cranial nerve deficits at the onset of illness. Pupillary reflexes may be depressed and fixed or dilated pupils are sometimes noted. The cornerstones of treatment for botulism are meticulous intensive care and administration of botulinum antitoxin. Option A: In poliomyelitis, weakness is generally asymmetric, more proximal than distal, and may involve the legs (most commonly), the arms, or the abdominal, thoracic, or bulbar muscles. Option C: Guillain–Barre syndrome is usually associated with ascending flaccid paralysis. Option D: Tetanus causes spastic paralysis.",

This is followed by identification of the organism in the growth and tests to confirm toxin production. This method has a sensitivity of 100%. Cell cytotoxicity neutralization assay (CCNA)- A stool filtrate is prepared and applied onto a monolayer of an appropriate cell line. The cells are observed for toxin-induced cytopathic effect (CPE). This is followed by a neutralization assay to confirm that the CPE is attributable to C.difficile toxins. Sensitivity is around 75-85% when compared to toxigenic culture (reference standard) Nucleic acid amplification tests (e.g.PCR)- More sensitive (93.3%) for C.difficile detection than toxin immunoassays but less sensitive than toxigenic culture. Toxin immunoassays- Enzyme immunoassays using monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against C.difficile toxins. Sensitivity is lower than other tests.

It has been used for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis in patients with HIV(who frequently have a negative Mantoux test). Interferon-gamma release assays include: QuantiFERON-TB Gold T-SPOT.TB QuantiFERON-TB Gold quantitates the amount of IFN- produced by CD4+ T cells in response to the antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT- Plus) is an improved version of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. QuantiFERON-TB Gold detects only TB-specific CD4+ responses. However, QuantiFeron-TB Gold Plus detects both CDù+ and CD4+ T-cell responses to TB-specific antigens. T-SPOT.TB determines the total number of individual effector T cells expressing IFN-. The TrueNat TB test is a new molecular test that can diagnose TB in one hour as well as test for rifampicin resistance. This test uses a sputum sample taken from the patient. Only about 0.5 ml of the sample is required. Gene Xpert is also a molecular method of testing that cannot use blood as a sample. (Option A and B)",

The test is performed by inoculating the organism in phenylalanine agar. After incubation, 10% ferric chloride is added to the media. If phenyl pyruvic acid was produced, it will react with the ferric chloride and turn dark green. If the medium remains a straw colour, the organism is negative for phenylalanine deaminase production.

P. mirabilis is indole negative while P. vulgaris is indole positive. Production of urease enzyme by Proteus, which hydrolyses urea to ammonia causes alkalinization of urine. Alkalinization of urine leads to the precipitation of organic and inorganic compounds which contributes to the formation of Struvite stones.

The fever is accompanied by relative bradycardia which is known as the Faget sign. Hepatosplenomegaly is a common finding on examination. Rose spots that fade on pressure appear on the skin during the second or third week. Since bile is a good culture medium for the bacilli, they multiply abundantly in the gallbladder and are discharged continuously into the intestine. In the intestine, it causes inflammation and necrosis leaving behind the characteristic typhoid ulcers which are oriented along the axis of the intestine (longitudinal ulcers). Ulceration of the bowel leads to two major complications- intestinal perforation and hemorrhage. Option B: In intestinal tuberculosis, ulcers are perpendicular to the axis of the intestine (transverse ulcers). Option C: Flask shaped ulcers are characteristic of amoebiasis.

Paratyphoid O antigens cross-reacts with the typhoid O antigen due to the sharing of factor 12. It is not used in the test and thus, O antibody cannot differentiate between Salmonella types. H agglutinin titer > 160 and O agglutinin titer > 80 is considered significant. However, a 4-fold rise in titers between 1st and 3rd week is more significant compared to a single high titer because of the possibility of an anamnestic reaction - a transient rise of titer due to unrelated infections (malaria, dengue) in persons who had a prior enteric fever.

Mechanism of action of cholera toxin: The cholera toxin molecule consists of 1 A and 5 B subunits. The B (binding) units attach to th GM1 ganglioside receptors on the surface of jejunal epithelial cells. The A (active) subunit, on being transported into the enterocyte, dissociates into A1 and A2. A2 fragment only links biologically active A1 to the B subunit. A1 causes prolonged activation of cellular adenylate cyclase and accumulation of cAMP, leading to outpouring into the small intestinal lumen, of large quantities of water and electrolytes. This leads to watery diarrhea which is isotonic with plasma but contains much more potassium and bicarbonate. The toxin also inhibits the intestinal absorption of sodium and chloride. All clinical manifestations and complications in cholera result from the massive water and lectrolyte depletion thus caused.",

Mechanism of action of cholera toxin: The cholera toxin molecule consists of 1 A and 5 B subunits. The B (binding) units attach to th GM1 ganglioside receptors on the surface of jejunal epithelial cells. The A (active) subunit, on being transported into the enterocyte, dissociates into A1 and A2. A2 fragment only links biologically active A1 to the B subunit. A1 causes prolonged activation of cellular adenylate cyclase and accumulation of cAMP, leading to outpouring into the small intestinal lumen, of large quantities of water and electrolytes and th consequent watery diarrhea, that is isotonic with plasma but contains much more of potassium and bicarbonate. The toxin also inhibits the intestinal absorption of sodium and chloride. All clinical manifestations and complications in cholera result from the massive water and lectrolyte depletion thus caused.",

It is an oxidase variable organism. In this case, the horse likely had glanders, which presents with fever, pneumonia, and subcutaneous nodules called Farcy buds. Discharges from the respiratory tract and skin are highly infectious and can be transmitted to humans through close contact (occupational route). The horse-groomer likely contracted the infection by the inhalational route and developed acute glanders, which is characterised by fever, mucopurulent nasal discharge and ulcerative necrosis of upper respiratory tract (ulcerative tracheobronchitis). It may lead to septicemia and has a high fatality rate. Percutaneous exposure causes local suppurative skin lesions with associated regional lymphadenopathy. B. mallei is a non-motile Gram-negative bacillus causing Glanders disease. It is an aerobe and a facultative anaerobe. It is oxidase variable i.e. it is usually oxidase negative but may occasionally show a positive reaction. It is a biosafety level 3 pathogen and so must be handled only in specialised laboratories. When male guinea pigs are inoculated intraperitoneally with suspected infectious material, it causes Strauss reaction. B. mallei sets up a necrotizing inflammation in the scrotal sac within a few days and can be confirmed bacteriologically.",

Tdap is now also recommended for pregnant women in between 27 weeks and 36 weeks of gestation by the ACOG. This is because infants between the age of 0-2 months are vulnerable to pertussis as they do not begin their vaccine schedule before 6 weeks of age. Thus to protect these infants, placental transfer of maternal pertussis antibodies has proven to be the most effective approach. Children under 4 years who are contacts of patients should receive a booster even if they had been previously immunized.

Syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum, a spirochete bacillus. It is a sexually transmitted infection. Intrauterine transmission can lead to congenital syphilis. It shows corkscrew motility which can be demonstrated by darkfield microscopy. Treponema can be stained by silver impregnation methods. Fontana's method is used on smear Levaditi's method is used for tissue sections The clinical manifestations of syphilis include: Primary syphilis: The typical primary chancre usually begins as a single painless papule that rapidly becomes eroded and usually becomes indurated, with a characteristic cartilaginous consistency on palpation of the edge and base of the ulcer. Inguinal lymphadenopathy is bilateral and may occur with anal as well as with genital chancres. The chancre generally heals within 4–6 weeks (range, 2–12 weeks), but lymphadenopathy may persist for months. Secondary syphilis: The various features include mucocutaneous or cutaneous lesions and generalized nontender lymphadenopathy. macular, papular, papulosquamous, and occasionally pustular syphilides. Other features of secondary syphilis include sore throat, fever, weight loss, malaise, anorexia, headache, and meningismus. Ocular findings associated with secondary (or later/ unknown-stage) syphilis include pupillary abnormalities and optic neuritis as well as the classic iritis or uveitis. Latent syphilis: Early latent syphilis is limited to the first year after infection, whereas late latent syphilis is defined as that of 1 year’s duration (or of unknown duration). T. pallidum may still seed the bloodstream intermittently during the latent stage, and latent syphilis in a pregnant woman may infect the fetus in utero. Neurosyphilis: The major clinical categories of symptomatic neurosyphilis include meningeal, meningovascular, and parenchymatous syphilis. Cardiovascular syphilis: Cardiovascular involvement results in uncomplicated aortitis, aortic regurgitation, saccular aneurysm (usually of the ascending aorta), or coronary ostial stenosis. Congenital syphilis: The earliest manifestations of congenital syphilis include rhinitis, or “snuffles”; mucocutaneous lesions, bone changes, including periostitis detectable by x-ray examination of long bones; hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, anemia, jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis. Serologic tests for syphilis recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Screening or diagnosis (RPR or VDRL), Quantitative measurement of antibody to assess clinical syphilis activity or to monitor response to therapy (RPR or VDRL) Confirmation of a syphilis diagnosis in a patient with a reactive RPR or VDRL test (FTA-ABS, TPHA, EIA/CIA) Treatment of syphilis is with 2.4 million units of intramuscular benzathine penicillin.",

        "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis based on the clinical vignette is leptospirosis. Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. Patients with mild disease may present with flu-like symptoms of sudden onset, fever with chills, headache, abdominal pain, conjunctival suffusion, and myalgia. The muscle pain usually affects the calves, abdomen, and back. Mild cases can be treated with oral doxycycline, ampicillin, or amoxicillin. Severe leptospirosis is rapidly progressive and is associated with high fatality. The classic presentation of the severe disease called Weil’s syndrome includes the triad of hemorrhage, jaundice, and acute kidney injury. Jaundice when present can be profound and physical examination may reveal an enlarged, tender liver. Temperature-pulse dissociation /relative bradycardia can be seen. Moderate to severe cases are treated with intravenous penicillin, ampicillin, or ceftriaxone. The image below shows icterus and conjunctival suffusion in a patient with leptospirosis. Leptospira are actively motile organisms and are best seen using a dark-field microscope. They are thin, tightly coiled, and flexible spirochetes with one end forming a hook. Diagnosis is by microscopic agglutination test. Transmission occurs through cuts or breaks in the skin and mucous membranes (conjunctival and oral mucosa). Several outbreaks have been reported that resulted from exposure to floodwaters contaminated by urine from infected animals. The organism enters the bloodstream and lodges in the parenchymatous organs (liver and kidneys) leading to hemorrhage and necrosis of the tissue causing dysfunction of the organs. The lifecycle of Leptospira is shown below. Illness is classically biphasic after an incubation period of up to 1 month. The stages are: Acute leptospiremic phase- the organism can be cultured from blood. Resolving immune phase- the organism can be cultured from urine. The stages may not be clinically distinguishable. Other options: Option A - Chikungunya is a viral disease that presents with saddle-back fever, conjunctival suffusion, and photophobia. Migratory arthralgia, especially involving small joints may also be seen. A maculopapular or petechial rash is frequently seen on the trunk. Option C - Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a form of severe dengue with bleeding manifestations. Evidence of plasma leakage and thrombocytopenia is also generally seen. Option D - Encephalitis due to Hepatitis A is seen in fulminant hepatitis, a rare complication. Patients present with confusion, disorientation, ascites, and edema. General Properties of Viruses",

Treatment: There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus: (SARS CoV 2) Wash your hands frequently for atleast 20 seconds. Maintain social distancing- Maintain at least 1 metre distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth Practice respiratory hygiene- cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when ou cough or sneeze, then dispose of the used tissue immediately. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care earl Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider",

Mycetoma is a chronic, granulomatous infection of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, fascia and bone, which most often affects the foot or the hand. It can be divided into three types- eumycetomas, actinomycetomas and botryomycosis. Infection follows traumatic inoculation of the organism into the subcutaneous tissue from soil or vegetable sources. Within host tissues, the organisms develop to form compacted colonies (grains) 0.5–2 mm in diameter, the color of which depends on the organism responsible. It results in tumefactions, deformities and draining sinuses discharging these grains or granules. Laboratory Diagnosis: A. Direct Examination: The presence of grains in pus collected from draining sinuses or in biopsy material is diagnostic. B. Culture Samples should also be cultured, at both 25–30°C and 37°C, on brain-heart infusion agar or blood agar for actinomycetes and on Sabouraud agar (without cycloheximide) for fungi. Treatment: The management of eumycetoma is difficult, involving surgical debridement or excision and chemotherapy. Actinomycetoma on the other hand, responds well to rifampicin in combination with sulfonamides or cotrimoxazole. Option A: Actinomadura madurae causes actinomycetoma which would respond to antibiotics. Option B: Sporothrix schenckii causes sporotrichosis which is characterised by lesions along the route of lymphatics. Option C: Fonsecaea pedrosoi causes chromoblastomycosis which would not have discharging sinuses.",

The serotypes B and C are now considered a different species - Cryptococcus gattii. Niger seed agar is a solid medium used for selective and differential isolation of Cryptococcus neoformans from clinical specimens.

Host is an organism that harbors the parasite and provides nourishment and shelter to it. It is relatively larger than the parasite. Types of hosts: Definitive host - harbors stages of sexual reproduction of the parasite. Intermediate host - harbors stages of asexual multiplication of the parasite. Paratenic host - harbors only the larval stage of the parasite which remains viable without further development.

In case of P.vivax and P.ovale, two kinds of sporozoites are seen. Some multiply inside hepatic cells to form schizonts while others persist and remain dormant as hypnozoites (resting forms). These dormant forms may get activated and release merozoites, which go on infecting RBCs producing true clinical relapse. It usually occurs after 6 to 12 months of complete cure from the disease. In case of P.falciparum and P.malariae, the initial tissue phase disappears completely and no hypnozoites are found, hence relapse is not seen. In Plasmodium falciparum, recrudescence can be seen which is defined as the recurrence of asexual parasitemia. It usually occurs within 8 weeks of treatment and is due to incomplete treatment or drug resistance.",

Its life cycle includes 2 stages - the motile trophozoite and the non-motile cyst, both of which are seen in the image shown above. The transmission is primarily by the fecal-oral route. There is no animal reservoir. The ingested cysts differentiate into trophozoites in the ileum which invade the colonic epithelium. The trophozoites penetrate to the submucosal layer and form abscesses which break down to form flask-shaped ulcer. The trophozoites multiply by binary fission and produce cysts, and both stages are passed in the feces. Trophozoites are rapidly destroyed outside the body. Cysts survive in the external environment and are responsible for transmission. The most frequent site of systemic disease is the liver. Note: The genus Entamoeba has four morphologically identical species - E. histolytica, E. dispar, E. bangladeshi, and E. moshkovskii. E. moshkovskii which was initially thought to be non-pathogenic has recently been shown to be a causative agent of non-invasive diarrhea.",

Infection occurs by the ingestion of mature cysts in contaminated water and food and is transmitted by the faeco-oral route. It is weakly pathogenic in humans. Secretory IgA and IL-6 are responsible for clearing the infection. Hence, giardiasis usually occurs in immunosuppressed, agammaglobulinemic, or malnourished individuals. Clinical features: Diarrhea Fat malabsorption Dull epigastric pain Belching and flatulence Iron deficiency and growth stunting. Stool will have excess mucus and fat but no blood. Detection of antigen by ELISA is more sensitive and specific than microscopy. Entero test is also used in the diagnosis. Histopathology of the duodenum reveals several heart-shaped or pear-shaped trophozoites with two equally sized nuclei. The small intestinal morphology is usually normal.

It passes its life cycle in two hosts- the definitive host is the man and the intermediate host (vector) is reduviid bug or triatomine bugs. Metacyclic trypomastigotes are the infective forms to the man that are found in feces of reduviid bugs. Transmission occurs when mucus membranes, conjunctiva, or wound on the surface of the skin are contaminated by feces of the bug. Inside the definitive host, the trypomastigotes differentiate into intracellular amastigotes. The amastigotes multiply by binary fission and differentiate into trypomastigotes, which are then released into the bloodstream. These are the infective stage for triatomine bug. No multiplication occurs in this stage. Inside the triatomine bug, the trypomastigotes are transformed into epimastigotes and then into metacyclic trypomastigotes in the hindgut which are excreted in feces. Note: Amastigote forms resemble the Leishmania spp. and hence they are frequently known as Leishmanial forms. They are found in muscular tissue, nervous tissue, and reticuloendothelial system.",

Toxoplasma gondii has two types of life cycles: Enteric cycle Exoenteric cycle The enteric cycle occurs in definitive hosts such as cats. Exoenteric cycle occurs in intermediate hosts such as humans, mice, rats, etc. Both asexual reproduction (schizogony) and sexual reproduction (gametogony) occur within the mucosal epithelial cells of the small intestine of the cat. The tachyzoites and tissue cyst represent stages in asexual multiplication, while the oocyst is formed by sexual reproduction. All three forms, tachyzoites, tissue cyst, and oocyst occur in the definitive host. Only the asexual forms, tachyzoites, and tissue cysts are present in the intermediate host. Tachyzoites continue to multiply and spread locally by the lymphatic system and blood, while the bradyzoites multiply slowly inside the tissue cyst. The dormant bradyzoites inside the cyst may be reactivated on immune suppression causing renewed infection in the host. The below image shows the life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii.",

Sabin-Feldman dye test is a serological test done for the detection of antibodies against toxoplasma. IIF (indirect immunofluorescence), IHA (indirect heamagglutination), and CFT (complement fixation test) are also used for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. Dye test remains positive throughout life, while CFT becomes negative soon after acute infection. ELISA is most commonly used and IgM and IgG antibodies are estimated separately. Standard treatment is sulfadiazine/pyrimethamine and leucovorin for a minimum of 4–6 weeks. The drug of choice for toxoplasmosis in pregnancy is spiramycin.",

The two cryptosporidium species responsible are C. hominis and C. parvum. The infective form is the oocyst excreted in the patient's feces, which can be acquired through drinking or during recreational water activities. The oocysts are immediately infectious (unlike isospora oocysts, which require maturation), and may cause autoinfection or be implicated in person-to-person transmission. Because of their small size (4-5micron), they is difficult to see using routine staining. Hence acid-fast/Kinyoun's stain is used. Once ingested, the 4 sporozoites are released from the cyst and attach to the small intestinal mucosa. It causes crampy abdominal pain and non-inflammatory watery diarrhea.

The adult flukes in the bile ducts produce eggs, which are excreted in the feces. The eggs hatch in freshwater and miracidia enter the snails. Miracidia develop into cercariae, which then encyst on aquatic vegetation. Sheep and humans eat the plants, thus completing the life cycle. Most infections are asymptomatic.

This is most commonly caused by Ancylostoma braziliense. Cutaneous larva migrans is caused by non-human hookworms like Ancylostoma braziliense and Ancylostoma caninum. It is acquired via direct skin contact with soil contaminated by dog or cat feces. The larvae remain confined to the outer layers of skin, as they are unable to penetrate the basement membrane of the human skin. It presents as erythematous, pruritic papules at the site of entry and serpiginous tracks in the epidermis. The symptoms begin to appear within the first two weeks of the patient’s return from a tropical or endemic country. The larval track progresses at approximately 1 cm/h with cutaneous lesions only progressing a few millimeters to a few centimeters daily. Diagnosis is based mainly on clinical features. The treatment includes: Thiabendazole topical application Albendazole 400mg/day X 3 days or Ivermectin 200mcg/kg single dose stat The differences between cutaneous larva migrans and visceral larva migrans are: Note: A rapidly moving lesion (10cm/hr) produced by Strongyloides stercoralis is known as larva currens (running larva).

The vector is blackfly (Simulium species) which breed in fast-flowing rivers, and therefore the disease is most common along the course of rivers. Hence, it is also called river blindness. The usual presentation is formation of a subcutaneous nodule or onchocercoma. It is a firm non-tender nodule arising from bony sites like scalp, elbow, ribs, and iliac crest. It is associated with pruritus and rashes. The microfilaria in the eyes cause photophobia and gradual loss of vision. The most severe manifestation is sclerosing keratitis and chorioretinitis which causes blindness. It is the 2nd major infective cause of blindness in the world after trachoma. Suramin and diethylcarbamazine (DEC) were used earlier but are not used nowadays. DEC destroys microfilariae but usually causes Mazzotti reaction consisting of pruritus, rash, lymphadenopathy, fever, hypotension, and occasionally, eye damage.

        "explanation": "Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to quantify the PCR by monitoring the amplification process while the PCR is ongoing. Types of PCR: Reverse transcriptase PCR- The enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) is used to synthesize a complementary copy of DNA (cDNA) from RNA and this cDNA is then used as a template for PCR. Real-time PCR- This helps quantify the PCR and gives an estimate of the pathogen DNA load in the specimen. It uses fluorescent dyes or specific DNA probes. It is also known as qPCR (Quantitative PCR) Multiplex PCR- Primers to more than one pathogen are used simultaneously and hence multiple products are obtained. Nested PCR- It involves the sequential use of two primer sets. The first primer set is used for amplification and the amplicon obtained is then used as a target sequence for second amplification. This ensures specificity.",

When antibodies bind to antigens on the surface of red blood cells, the resultant clumping reaction is referred to as hemagglutination. It is routinely performed to type red blood cells in ABO blood-typing. The image below shows hemagglutination. In ELISA, radioimmunoassay and immunofluorescence, the antigens or antibodies are labeled or marked with enzymes, fluorescent dyes, etc. Note: If no hemagglutination occurs it means the patient’s serum has anti-haemagglutinin antibodies that bind to hemagglutinin and prevent the clumping reaction. This hemagglutination inhibition reaction is a method of detection of viruses and antiviral-antibodies and is used to make a diagnosis of influenza.",

Leukocyte esterase test- It is a rapid and cheaper method and detects leukocyte esterases secreted by pus cells present in urine. Nitrate reduction test (Griess test)- Nitrate reducing bacteria like E. coli gives a positive result.

Streptococcus viridans is usually sensitive to penicillin and vancomycin hence it is ruled out.
