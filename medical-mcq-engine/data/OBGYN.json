By the third month, this side of the chorion becomes smooth, and is called the chorion laeve. As the fetus grows, the chorion laeve comes into contact with the decidua parietalis on the opposite side of the uterus, and fusion occurs. Thus, the uterine lumen is obliterated.

Uterine transplantation immunity contributes to the survival of the fetus in spite of it being semiallogenic. This occurs due to the following factors: Decidual natural killer cells are inefficient, and therefore are unable to attack the 'foreign' fetal cells. Decidual stromal cells work with natural killer cells to allow trophoblastic invasion. Villous trophoblastic cells don't express HLA antigens and therefore, they are non-immunogenic.",

The beta-subunit is specific and is measured by pregnancy tests. hCG can be detected in maternal blood 8 days after fertilisation.

It contains umbilical vessels and an obliterated allantois duct, all surrounded by Wharton's jelly and contained within an outer layer of amnion. Maternal blood enters the fetus through the umbilical vein, and blood exits the fetus via the two umbilical arteries. Wharton's jelly is a gelatinous mucopolysaccharide that protects the umbilical vessels. Local collections of Wharton's jelly produce false knots in the cord. The average length of the umbilical cord is between 40-70 cm at term. A long cord can form a loop around the fetus' neck and can cause asphyxia. A short cord can result in cord rupture during labor.",

It is commonly associated with renal anomalies such as unilateral renal agenesis, severe renal hypoplasia, etc, and is often associated with recurrent pregnancy loss, preterm labour, malpresentation, and prematurity. 3D ultrasound, a non-invasive test, visualizes both the external (serosal) and interna (endometrial) uterine contours, effectively identifying anomalies. Hysterosalpingography (Option C) shows only the internal contour, making it unable to distinguish between conditions like didelphys, bicornuate, septate, or arcuate uterus. The USG findings in didelphys uterus are two widely separated uterine horns and a deep fundal indentation. çaparoscopy and hysteroscopy, being invasive diagnostic procedures, should be reserved for cases where simultaneous surgical treatment is planned following a comprehensive non-invasive assessment of a Mullerian anomaly.

An increase in hCG during pregnancy stimulates thyroid and leads to a decrease in TSH levels. The thyroid undergoes enlargement and boosts the production of hormones. This is accompanied by increased production of thyroid-binding globulin(TBG). All these changes increase total T4 and T3 in the first trimester. But the physiologically important free T4 and T3 levels remain unchanged. Hence, physiologically pregnant women remain euthyroid. Option A: Normal pregnancy is characterized by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Human placental lactogen(hPL) secreted during pregnancy, helps in adaptation to fetal energy requirements. Insulin resistance causes prolonged hyperglycemia and glucose flow to the fetus. It also favours protein synthesis. To counterbalance the increased insulin resistance and prevent maternal hyperglycemia, maternal insulin levels are increased. Option B: By the 3rd trimester, there is an increase in the maternal basal metabolic rate by 10 to 20% in comparison to a nonpregnant woman. Option D: During normal pregnancy, mean arterial pressure and vascular resistance decrease, while blood volume and cardiac output rate increase.

Risk factors include Pre-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome, male fetus, previous history of AFLP, and multiple gestations. AFLP (acute yellow atrophy or acute fatty metamorphosis) is the most common cause of acute liver failure in pregnancy. It usually occurs in the later stages of pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. It occurs due to fetal deficiency of long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCHAD) or poor placental mitochondrial function. The patients present with persistent nausea and vomiting, progressive jaundice, and epigastric pain. Features like acute hemolysis, hypoglycemia, hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, and edema can also be present. Symptoms may progress to fulminant hepatic failure with encephalopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death. Liver function tests such as AST, ALT, and serum bilirubin levels are raised. Hypofibrinogenemia, hypocholesterolemia, and prolonged clotting time can be seen. An elevated d-dimer is seen. Microscopy reveals a characteristic microvesicular fatty infiltration. The condition worsens till delivery after which the hepatic dysfunction resolves. A trial of labor by induction or delivery by Cesarean is done. Intensive supportive measures including blood transfusion should be provided.

Less than 5% of births follow Naegele's rule. It is based on a 28-day regular cycle. If the cycle is shorter/longer than 28 days, corrected EDD is calculated as follows: For a 35-day cycle, add another 7 (35-28=7) days to the calculated EDD to get the corrected EDD. For a 25-day cycle, subtract 3 (28-25=3) days from the calculated EDD to get the corrected EDD. Naegele’s rule cannot be followed in IVF pregnancies. Considering the human embryo takes 266 days to develop, EDD is calculated in IVF pregnancies by the following method: Same day as fertilization (day 0): EDD = date of transfer + 266 days 3 days after fertilization (day 3): EDD = date of transfer + 263 days 5 days after fertilization (day 5): EDD = date of transfer + 261 days",

The radiation dose to the fetus during the declared term of pregnancy should be less than 1 mSv. In chest X-ray PA view, the absorbed dose of radiation by the fetus is less than 0.1 mSv. Hence, pregnancy can be continued. An X-ray has a very limited role in obstetric imaging. There are very few indications where an X-ray will be useful: Fetal: congenital malformation of the fetus and neonates, skeletal malformations, birth injuries like fractures or dislocations. Maternal: Patients having cardiopulmonary disease may require an X-ray chest during pregnancy and that should be done beyond 12 weeks. Radiation can cause fetal morbidity (FGR, genetic mutations, neurologic abnormalities, mental retardation, childhood leukemia) and mortality. The risks are high with radiation after the first 2 weeks postconception and within the first trimester (period of organogenesis). Radiation during pregnancy can damage the early phase of the embryo but the risk can be minimized by using the ‘10-day rule’.

Helps in identification of fetal lie and determination of fetal pole at the fundus. The breech gives the sensation of a large, irregular mass. The head feels hard and round and is more mobile. Lateral grip (second Leopold): Assesses the fetal orientation. The palms are placed on either side of the maternal abdomen, and gentle but deep pressure is exerted. The back is felt on one side as a hard, resistant structure. The fetal extremities are felt on the other side as numerous small, irregular, mobile parts are felt. Fetal orientation can be determined by noting whether the back is directed anteriorly, transversely, or posteriorly. The position of the anterior shoulder is mainly assessed by this grip. Pawlik's grip / 1st pelvic grip (third Leopold): Assesses the presenting part in respect to the true pelvis. The thumb and fingers of one hand grasp the lower portion of the maternal abdomen just above the symphysis pubis. If the presenting part is not engaged, a movable mass will be felt, usually the head. Deep pelvic grip / 2nd pelvic grip (fourth Leopold): Assesses the engagement, attitude of the fetal head and determine the degree of descent. The examiner faces the mother's feet, and the fingertips of both hands are positioned on either side of the presenting part. They exert inward pressure and then slide along the axis of the pelvic inlet. If the head has already descended into the pelvis, the anterior shoulder or the space created by the neck may be differentiated readily from the head. It is the only grip performed facing the feet.",

Amniocentesis is a diagnostic test for amniotic fluid AFP measurement. It was once considered the standard for the diagnosis of open neural tube disorders but has been replaced in most centers by targeted sonography. Defects in fetal integuments, such as ventral wall and neural tube defects, permit fetal AFP to leak into the amnionic fluid. This results in increased MSAFP levels. This is detected on screening performed from 15 to 20 weeks of gestation.

Frog eye sign - Absence of cranial calvaria, prominent orbits thereby resembling the face of a frog. Shower cap sign - The absence of the cranium could lead to the protrusion of a disorganized mass of brain tissue. This resembles a shower cap giving rise to a characteristic triangular facia appearance. Neural-tube defects can be prevented with pre-conceptional supplementation of folic acid. A dose of 4 mg daily is recommended in subsequent pregnancies. The frog eye and showercap signs are shown below: Option B: Omphalocele is a midline anterior abdominal wall defect through which the solid abdominal viscera and/or bowel may herniate.

While the hand on the abdomen is pressed backwar ds and slightly upward, the other applies gentle traction on the cord. Type III placenta previa is a type of incomplete or partial central placenta previa. Here, the placenta covers the internal os partially i.e. it covers the internal os when closed but does not entirely do so when fully dilated.

WHO recommendations for the prevention of perineal tears include warm compresses to the perineum, perineal massage, guarding the perineum, and modified Ritgen's maneuver. Modified Ritgen's maneuver: A sterile towel or pad is held in one hand and placed over the perineum; the other hand applies gentle downward pressure on the occiput to promote flexion and controlled delivery of the head (ensuring the smallest diameter of the head passes through the outlet). Once the occiput is born–with gentle pressure, the head is extended–forehead, nose, and mouth are then delivered. WHO doesn't recommend fundal pressure and routine episiotomy. Other options: Option A: A liberal or routine episiotomy is discouraged. Episiotomy is indicated in cases of: Shoulder dystocia Breech delivery Fetal macrosomia Operative vaginal deliveries Persistent occiput posterior positions Option C: Manual techniques, such as massage or application of warm compresses, are recommended for healthy pregnant women requesting pain relief during labor. Option D: The position that is most comfortable to the mother i.e. upright/squatting position is encouraged. This position gives: ess discomfort and difficulty in bearing down ess labor pain ess perineal/vaginal trauma and wound infections Second stage Nulliparous Multiparous Mean/average duration 50 minutes 30 minutes Maximum duration 2 hours (+1 with epidural) 1 hour (+1 with epidural) Second stage Nulliparous Multiparous WHO maximum duration of 2nd stage/diagnosis of arrest 3 hours 2 hours",

On the other hand, delayed cord clamping can lead to a higher hemoglobin concentration, which increases risks for hyperbilirubinemia and extended hospitalization for neonatal phototherapy. Delayed cord clamping can also hinder timely neonatal resuscitation. According to AIIMS Protocols in Neonatology, in uncomplicated preterm birth, delayed cord clamping should be attempted.

They can be blunt-tipped/pointed tip/straight or curved. Straight mayo scissors are designed for cutting body tissues near the surface of a wound. They are also used to cut sutures and are also known as suture-cutting scissors. Curved mayo scissors allow much deeper penetration into the wound and are used to cut thick tissues such as those found in the uterus, muscles, breast, and foot.

Clinical features of obstructed labor include maternal exhaustion, dehydration, tachycardia, tachypnea, genital sepsis, postpartum hemorrhage, and shock. On P/A examination the upper uterine segment is tender and tonically contracted. The lower uterine segment is thin and stretched. A groove/depression is felt between the upper uterine segment and the lower uterine segment. This is called a Bandls ring.

With each contraction there is myometrial shortening so that the actively contracting upper segment becomes progressively thicker and shorter. The passive lower segment is progressively stretched and becomes thinner. The junction between the two segments stands out prominently as a pathological retraction ring. Schroeder's constriction ring is formed due to incordinate uterine action when there is localized spastic contraction of a ring of circular muscle fibres of the uterus. It is formed due to injudicious use of oxytocin and premature rupture of membranes (PROM).",

It is associated with an increase in blood levels of a prostaglandin F2 metabolite, also known as dinoprost. This is released due to mechanical stretching of the internal os. This enhances the uterine activity and causes release of more prostaglandins. It is an example of a positive feedback mechanism.",

An attempt at traction is tried followed by episiotomy to afford room posteriorly. Apply pressure suprapubically, not fundally, with the palm or fist, directing the pressure on the anterior shoulder. This should be both downward (below the pubic bone) and laterally (toward the baby's face or sternum) in conjunction with the McRoberts manoeuvre.

The baby is swung in an arc towards the mother's abdomen. Simultaneous suprapubic pressure is given and the head is born by flexion. Malar flexion and shoulder traction (modified Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit technique): The baby is placed on the supinated left forearm (preferred) with the limbs hanging on either side. The middle and the index fingers of the left hand are placed over the malar bones. The ring and little fingers of the pronated right hand are placed on the child’s right shoulder. The index finger is placed on the left shoulder and the middle finger is placed on the suboccipital region. Traction is now given in a downward and backward direction till the nape of the neck is visible under the pubic arch. The assistant gives suprapubic pressure during the period to maintain flexion.

Kristeller manoeuvre is the application of uterine fundal pressure during the second stage of labour to shorten the second stage of labour. This should be used sparingly used as it leads to avulsion of the levator ani. An incompletely dilated cervix will constrict around the neck and impede the delivery of the aftercoming head in breech. Management options: With gentle traction on the fetal body, the cervix may be manually slipped over the occiput. If this is not successful, then Dührssen incisions may be necessary. These are a set of three incisions in the cervix: Can be made at the 2 and 10 o'clock position on the cervix. An additional incision at the 6 o’clock position is sometimes needed. Done for delivery of aftercoming head in breech or delivery of head through an incompletely dilated cervix. There is a significant risk of haemorrhage; the cervical incision may extend upwards within the broad ligament causing broad ligament haematoma. Other alternatives include intravenous nitroglycerin, typically 100 g, to provide cervical relaxation. General anaesthesia with halogenated agents is another option. As a last resort, the following methods are used: Zavanelli manoeuvre: It involves the replacement of the fetal head into the pelvis followed by cesarean delivery. This is performed for the protruding head and intractable shoulder dystocia. Symphysiotomy: The intervening symphyseal cartilage and ligamentous supports are cut to widen the symphysis pubis.

The engaging diameter of this position is sub-occipitofrontal/occipitofrontal. The most common type in occipitoposterior position is right OP. A persistent occipitoposterior position results from a failure of internal rotation prior to birth. Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) is a disproportion in the size of the fetus relative to the maternal pelvis. This can result in the failure of progress of labour in the second stage. This usually occurs due to fetal malposition e.g., extended or asynclitic fetal head, occipitoposterior or transverse position. It is also seen in malpresentations like mentum posterior, brow. The diagnosis of CPD is subjective. However, true CPD may occur if the fetus has a large anomaly e.g., teratoma or conjoined twin, or in cases of a large fetus. It can also occur when the maternal pelvis is small or deformed like after pelvic trauma.",

This is used less commonly compared to the transverse abdominal incision. Incision '3' - Joel Cohen is a straight incision higher than the Pfannenstiel incision. The fascia was incised transversely in the midline then extended laterally with blunt finger dissection; finger dissection was used to separate the rectus muscles vertically and laterally. Incision '4' - Pfannenstiel incision is the most common incision made in caesarean delivery. It follows Langer lines of skin tension. A transverse and slightly curvilinear incision is made in the skin and subcutaneous tissue 3 cm above the superior border of the pubic symphysis.

It usually results from severe hypotension or shock caused by massive hemorrhage during or after delivery. Patients with SS have varying&deg; of anterior pituitary hormone deficiency. The hyperplastic enlargement of the pituitary, which occurs normally during pregnancy, increases the risk of infarction. Affected women may have persistent hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and lactation failure. The most prominent symptoms are lactation failure (due to a deficiency of prolactin) and postpartum amenorrhea (due to a deficiency of gonadotropins). Because deficiencies of some or all pituitary-responsive hormones may develop after the initial insult, Sheehan syndrome can be heterogeneous and may not be identified for years. It can present acutely as pituitary apoplexy, an endocrine emergency, characterized by a sudden onset of headache, nausea, visual deficits, and in severe cases, severe hypoglycemia, hypotension and shock, CNS hemorrhage, and death. Also, it can present late with the following features: Loss of pubic and axillary hair Hypothyroidism due to decreased TSH secretion Adrenal insufficiency due to low ACTH Treatment is by hormone replacement - first glucocorticoids, later - thyroid hormone, sex steroids, vasopressin and growth hormones are given. If there is evidence of progressive visual loss, cranial nerve involvement or loss of consciousness, immediate surgical decompression must be carried out. Fertility can be achieved in these women with hMG and hCG. Clomiphene is ineffective. Option B: Rotor syndrome is a type of hereditary hyperbilirubinemia with autosomal recessive inheritance. Affected individuals have mild jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia. Option C: Prolactinoma or pituitary adenoids is the condition of hyperprolactinemia diagnosed by a prolactin level >200 g/L. It usually presents with infertility, amenorrhea, and galactorrhea. Option D: Acromegaly is characterized by the signs and symptoms pertaining to excessive growth hormone secretion.",

It can occur even after artificial reproductive therapy. Hence, after embryo transfer, intercourse must be avoided. Heteropaternal superfecundation is used to refer to instances of two different males fathering fraternal twins. This leads to the possibility of twins also being half-siblings. This may give rise to the doubt of adultery and infidelity. Superfetation is the fertilization of two ova released in different menstrual cycles. This is not seen in humans.

Option B: In Monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy, on gross examination, there will be 1 placenta and intervening 2 layers of amnion attached to the placenta. In this type of pregnancy, each fetus will have its own amniotic cavity (diamniotic) with a shared placenta (monochorionic). This is seen if the fertilized zygote divides into 2 between 4-8 days. The below given gross image of monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy shows two umbilical cords arising separately from the placenta with the intervening amniotic membrane held by the forceps. Option D: In dichorionic diamniotic pregnancy each fetus has it’s own amnion & chorion. The placentas here may be fused or separate.

Management of suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy consists of initial resuscitation and stabilization, followed by point-of-care ultrasound (FAST) to identify intraperitoneal free fluid and surgical exploration. Laparotomy is done for hemodynamically unstable patients with ruptured ectopic pregnancies. Salpingectomy is the treatment of choice and is done with preservation of the ipsilateral ovary and its vascular supply. For patients wishing to preserve future fertility, if the contralateral fallopian tube is damaged, salpingostomy is preferred. However, salpingostomy may result in inadequate evacuation of the products of conception and a recurrence of symptoms. Therefore, after a patient undergoes salpingostomy, it is important check the -hCG level on a weekly basis to ensure that it reaches zero.

Neurogenic type of shock develops due to stretching of the infundibulopelvic ligament and the ovaries. Option A: Amniotic fluid embolism causes cardiac arrest, acute hypoxia and severe haemorrhage.

The image shows compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus which can sometimes lead to supine hypotension. During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus compresses the great vessels against the hard spine, when the patient is in the supine position. Of the two vessels, the vena cava is compressed, but the aorta, owing to its structure is relatively resistant. Normally, the vena cava compression results in opening up collateral circulation by means of paravertebral and azygous veins but in some cases, when the collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return of the heart may be seriously curtailed resulting in hypotension, tachycardia, and syncope and is called supine vena cava syndrome. The normal blood pressure is quickly restored by turning the patient to the lateral position. Diabetes in Pregnancy",

For most cardiac patients, vaginal delivery is preferred and cesarean section is reserved for obstetric indications since the cesarean section is associated with more blood loss and higher thromboembolic and infection risk. If vaginal delivery is selected as the mode of choice, it will be conducted with the laboring woman in an upright position, or in the left decubitus position. This minimizes aortocaval compression. Active pushing during the second stage may also be limited, depending on the degree of cardiac compromise. In moderate to severe cardiac disease, it may be prudent to completely avoid an active second stage. Regional anesthesia can be used to allow the fetal head to descend to the perineum without active pushing. Delivery can be further facilitated by forceps or vacuum extraction. The benefit of avoiding hemodynamic fluctuations resulting from pushing must be weighed against an increased risk of perineal trauma, hemorrhage, and fetal head injury with forceps or vacuum delivery. Some journals report that ventouse is preferable to forceps, as it can be applied without putting the patient in lithotomy position (raising the legs increases the cardiac load) however it is controversial.",

The predisposing factors include Cardiac gene mutations involving several genes like TTNC1, TTN, and STAT3, Twin pregnancy/ multifetal gestation, Smoking, and Preeclampsia. Other proposed causes include viral myocarditis, abnormal immune response to pregnancy, malnutrition, inflammation, etc. PPCM is associated with increased secretion of prolactin by the pituitary and antiangiogenic molecule sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase) by the placenta at term gestation. Pearson’s diagnostic criteria for PPCM: Development of cardiac failure in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months after delivery Absence of an identifiable cause for the cardiac failure Absence of recognizable heart disease prior to the last month of pregnancy, and Left ventricular systolic dysfunction demonstrated by echocardiographic criteria, such as ejection fraction <45% or fractional shortening <30% along with a dilated left ventricle.

After exposure to acid, only fetal hemoglobin remains, such that after staining, the fetal erythrocytes appear red and adult cells appear as “ghosts.” Fetal cells are counted and expressed as a percentage of adult cells. Flow cytometry is the best test for the quantification of fetomaternal hemorrhage. It is more sensitive and accurate as compared to the Kleihauer-Betke test. Flow cytometry can analyze a larger number of cells and is not influenced by maternal levels of fetal hemoglobin and fetal levels of maternal hemoglobin.

The pathogenesis of mirror syndrome, although not well established, mimics trophoblastic damage and maternal vascular endothelial dysfunction, as is also seen in pre-eclampsia. Hence, these two conditions may have a similar clinical presentation, with common features such as: Edema Hypertension Proteinuria Liver enzyme elevation Headache and visual disturbances. However, in contrast to preeclampsia, the following features are noted in maternal mirror syndrome: Low maternal hematocrit i.e., hemodilution rather than hemoconcentration Polyhydramnios rather than oligohydramnios The fetus always shows signs of hydrops. The etiology of fetal hydrops is not related to the development of mirror syndrome. Hydrops could be due to rhesus isoimmunization, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, congenital infections, fetal cystic hygroma, Ebstein anomaly, sacrococcygeal teratoma, vein of Galen aneurysms, etc. In most cases with mirror syndrome, prompt delivery is indicated, because women with severe features of preeclampsia can deteriorate rapidly.

        "explanation": "The risk of developing fetal varicella syndrome (congenital varicella syndrome) is highest when the mother develops varicella infection between 13 to 20 weeks. Congenital varicella syndrome occurs in 2% of infants with maternal varicella between 13 and 20 weeks of gestation and in 0.4% of infants before 13 weeks of gestation. It is rare after 20 weeks. Congenital varicella syndrome is characterized by cicatricial skin scarring in a zoster-like pattern (zig-zag scarring), and limb hypoplasia (shown below). They can also present with neurological abnormalities (microcephaly, cortical atrophy, mental retardation), ophthalmic features (chorioretinitis, microphthalmia, cataract), and renal and autonomic system abnormalities (hydronephrosis, neurogenic bladder). Low birth weight is also common. Infants born to mothers with varicella in the period from 5 days prior to delivery up to 2 days after delivery are at high risk for severe neonatal varicella. They acquire the infection transplacentally. Since the mother has not developed a strong antibody response, the infant lacks the protective effect of maternal anti-varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibodies. Therefore varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) should be administered as soon as possible after birth to newborns whose mothers have varicella 5 days before and up to 2 days after the delivery. Since perinatally acquired varicella can be potentially life-threatening, the infant should typically be treated with intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg every 8 hours) when lesions appear. For pregnant women with uncomplicated primary varicella or herpes zoster that does not require hospitalization, the recommended treatment is oral acyclovir (800 mg five times daily for seven days).",

Estrogen–progesterone challenge test is indicated as an investigation in case of secondary amenorrhea. It depends on estrogen-primed endometrium being present in the uterus. Procedure: Ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg or conjugated equine estrogen 1.25 mg is to be taken daily for 25 days. Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg daily is added from day 15–25. Alternately, one course of oral contraceptive pill is given and to observe whether withdrawa bleeding occurs or not. Results: If there is no bleeding, a local endometrial lesion is present such as uterine synechiae. This is to be confirmed by HSG or hysteroscopy. If withdrawal bleeding occurs, the endometrium is responsive but the endogenous estrogen production is inadequate. Hence, the defect lies in the ovary, hypothalamus, or pituitary.",

Uterine prolapse is the descent of the uterus from its normal position which usually occurs due to laxity of ligaments that offer support, seen often due to childbirth, aging, or trauma. The uterine descent is clinically categorized into: First degree: the external os remains above the vaginal introitus Second degree: The external os protrudes below the vaginal introitus but the uterine body remains inside the vagina Third degree (Syn: Complete prolapse): The uterine, cervix, body, and fundus descend to lie outside the introitus Procidentia involves prolapse of the uterus with the entire vagina everted. The patient usually presents with a sense of heaviness in the pelvic region with lower back discomfort. Based on the structures involved the patient can additionally have urinary symptoms (like incontinence and urgency), bowel disturbances (constipation and tenesmus), or sexual discomfort during intercourse. Symptomatic uterine prolapse is managed surgically with different procedures based on the profile of the patient. Conservative management is done for old asymptomatic women with mild degree prolapse. A vaginal hysterectomy is recommended for patients who satisfy the following criteria: >40 years of age Have completed their families Do not wish to preserve menstrual and child-bearing function Other options: Option A: Fothergill repair or Manchester operation is a procedure done to preserve the reproductive function and vaginal prolapse with supravaginal cervix elongation. It initially involves preliminary curettage with low amputation of the cervix. After Mackenrodt's ligament is plicated, anterior colporrhaphy and colpoperineorrhaphy are performed. Option B: Sling operation (Purandare's operation) is indicated in congenital or nulliparous prolapse without cystocele. The procedure involves the extraperitoneal passage of rectus sheath strips joined to the anterior surface of the cervix by silk sutures. Option D: Shirodkar procedure is a type of abdominal sling surgery done in young women to retain menstrual and reproductive function.

Levator ani muscles are the most important muscles in the pelvic floor and maintain a constant state of contraction. They provide a stable floor and support the weight of the abdominopelvic contents against intra-abdominal forces. Weakening of levator ani and pelvic fascia from stretching or tearing during childbirth, may decrease support for the vagina, bladder, uterus, or rectum or alter the position of the neck of the bladder and urethra. The levator ani muscle is a complex unit, which consists of 3 muscle components namely Pubococcygeus (anterior fibers) Pubovaginalis - elevates the urethra and hence contributes to urinary continence Puboperinealis - draws the perineal body towards the pubic symphysis Puboanalis - elevates the anus and keeps the urogenital hiatus narrowed Puborectalis (intermediate fibers) Iliococcygeus (posterior fibers) Origin: The levator ani muscle has a linear origin from the pelvic surface of the body of the pubis, a tendinous arch of obturator fascia, and the pelvic surface of the ischial spine. Insertion: The anterior fibres form a sling around the prostate (levator prostatae) or vagina (sphincter vaginae) and are inserted into the perineal body (a mass of fibrous tissue) in front of the ana canal. The intermediate fibres (puborectalis) form a sling around the anorectal junction to be inserted into the anococcygeal raphe (a fibrous raphe which extends from the anorectal junction to the tip of the coccyx). The posterior fibres (iliococcygeus) are inserted into the anococcygeal raphe and the coccyx. Nerve supply: perineal branch of 4th sacral nerve (S4) from its pelvic surface. perineal branch of the pudendal nerve (S2, S3) from its perineal surface. Actions: The levator ani muscles of two sides together support the pelvic viscera and resist the intra-abdominal pressure during straining and expulsive efforts of the anterior abdominal wa muscles. They also subserve a sphincteric action on the anorectal junction to maintain the continence of faeces in both sexes and vagina in females. The given image below shows the pelvic floor:",

The incidence of fibroid in pregnancy is about 1 in 1,000. Due to increased vascularity in pregnancy, the fibroid increases in size and becomes softer. The torsion is seen in the subserous pedunculated fibroid where the venous return is blocked at its site of attachment in the uterus. This leads to severe acute abdominal pain. Due to the complication being more local than systemic, fever or leucocytosis are generally not seen. A transvaginal ultrasonogram is immediately done to detect the position and size of the fibroid, which is followed by laparotomic myomectomy as a part of emergency surgical management. Other options: Option A: Red degeneration of fibroid is seen commonly in the second half of pregnancy or puerperium. It is due to a hemorrhagic infarction of the tissue and typically presents as acute focal abdominal pain with fever and leucocytosis. Treatment is usually conservative with bed rest, analgesics, and sedatives. Option B: Preterm labor is where the labor starts before 37 completed weeks. It is characterized by true labor pain. The abdominal pain is slowly increasing in intensity and duration and is also accompanied by show (expulsion of the cervical mucus plug).

Nd:YAG myolysis is laparoscopic myolysis performed with an Nd:YAG laser. It causes coagulation of a subserous fibroid. The below image shows uterine artery embolization. Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) is also called MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU).

The lesions mentioned above are thought to be more active than the powder burn areas. Endometriotic lesions in the peritoneal cavity contain yellowish-brown fluid. This fluid contains prostaglandins that are responsible for the pain associated with this condition. Endometriosis of the ovary leads to formation of the chocolate cyst which is a true cyst with columnar epithelium lining.

Women affected by HAIR-AN syndrome often present with symptoms of severe hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne) and may occasionally display signs of virilization like clitoromegaly, temporal balding and voice deepening. Ovarian hyperthecosis is a rare condition characterized by nests of luteinized theca cells distributed throughout the ovarian stroma.",

The first step in the management of PCOS is weight reduction. OCPs are the drugs of choice for regularisation of cycles. They are also the drugs of choice for hirsutism and acne. OCPs used for PCOS should contain a 3rd/4th generation progestagen like cyproterone acetate. OCPs induce regular menstrual cycles, lower androgen levels and causes thinning of the endometrium. Insulin sensitizers like metformin have been found to improve metabolic and gynecologic issues. It acts by reducing the insulin level and reducing hepatic production of glucose (liver neoglycolysis). Other benefits of metformin include improvement in fertility rate and reduction of the total and free testosterone levels. It also increases levels of sex hormone-binding globulin. Metformin is contraindicated in hepatic and renal disease. Treatment of infertility associated with PCOS is done using ovulation-inducing drugs like letrozole and clomiphene citrate. If medical management fails, surgical options like laparoscopic ovarian drilling can be considered. Note: FOGSI, in 2024, has replaced Letrozole as the first-line drug for induction of ovulation in patients with PCOS. However, the FDA approval for the same is still pending.",

        "explanation": "The image showing enlarged ovaries with multiple large cysts along with the history of treatment for infertility with human menopausal gonadotropin suggests the diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) is a medication that is composed of FSH and LH. It is used to stimulate the release of ova in women who do not ovulate spontaneously. It can lead to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) is a condition associated with ovarian enlargement due to exogenous gonadotropin therapy. Symptoms include abdominal pain, distention, ascites, gastrointestinal problems, respiratory compromise, oliguria, and thromboembolism. It can occur during ovulation induction or in early pregnancies conceived through exogenous ovarian stimulation. Predisposing factors for OHSS include multi-follicular ovaries (such as in PCOS), young age, high estradiol levels during ovulation induction, and pregnancy. Vasoactive substances produced by the corpus luteum, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiotensin II, are believed to contribute to enhanced capillary permeability, resulting in the loss of fluid, protein, and electrolytes into the peritoneal cavity and hemoconcentration. Sonographic examination reveals enlarged ovaries with numerous follicular cysts and ascites. Maintaining fluid balance with isotonic fluids like normal saline is crucial. Strategies to prevent OHSS during exogenous ovulation include reducing follicular stimulation (low FSH dose), coasting (withholding FSH administration one or more days prior to the hCG trigger), prophylactic volume expanders, and substituting hCG for FSH towards the end of ovarian stimulation. Other options: Option B: Theca lutein cysts are a rare form of follicular cysts characterized by luteinization and hypertrophy of the theca interna layer. Both ovaries are enlarged and cystic. This condition is commonly associated with gestational trophoblastic disease, multifetal gestation, and placentomegaly. Option C: Polycystic ovarian syndrome shows 12 or more small follicles each 2-9 mm in size placed peripherally (necklace pattern) (shown below).

Thus, it is very cost-effective but it can only be used by educated couples. According to this method, safe period in a normal 28-day cycle is from the 1st day of menstrual period to the 10th day and from the 18th to the 28th day. An alternate method is by calculating the risk period i.e., 3 days before and 3 days after ovulation. Ovulation can also be estimated by changes in cervical mucus and basal body temperature. Another method of calculating the safe period is the Knaus–Ogino method. The fertile period is determined by subtracting 18 days from the shortest cycle and 10 days from the longest cycle. This gives the first and the last day of the fertile period, respectively.",

Progesterone-only pills act by thickening the cervical mucus (the main mechanism of all POPs except cerazette) that inhibits penetration of sperms, inhibiting tubal motility, and suppressing ovulation. Other advantages of POPs include a reduction in the incidence of pelvic inflammatory diseases and sexually transmitted diseases (due to thickened cervical mucus). Due to the inhibition of tubal motility, the absolute risk of all pregnancies including ectopic pregnancy decreases, while the relative risk of ectopic pregnancy increases. But a previous history of ectopic pregnancy is not a contraindication for POP. POPs do not affect clotting, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. So they can safely be used by women who are obese, breastfeeding, hypertensive, have SLE or a history of thromboembolism, diabetic with vascular disease. Significant adverse effects of POPs are irregular bleeding (mostly scanty), and secondary amenorrhea after longtime usage as it causes endometrial atrophy. Contraindications for POPs include undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, pregnancy, known or suspected breast cancer, and benign or malignant liver tumors.",

The growth of the warts is favoured by vaginal discharge, the use of oral contraceptives, and pregnancy. HPV causes structural changes in the epithelial cells of the skin called koilocytes, and their presence is characteristic of HPV infection. The koilocytes have large hyperchromatic nuclei and a perinuclear halo, as shown below. The diagnosis is made by colposcopic studies. The lesions on the vulva are stained by toluidine blue.

The initial infection involves the cervix uteri and urethra which may extend to Bartholin glands, skene glands, endometrium, and fallopian tubes. Unilateral pain and swelling over the labia may be caused by the inflammation of the Bartholin glands. Depending on the extent of tissue involved, PID can be classified into five stages Stage I - Acute salpingitis without peritonitis - No adhesions Stage II - Acute salpingitis with peritonitis - purulent discharge Stage III - Acute salpingitis with superimposed tubal occlusion or tubo ovarian complex Stage IV - Ruptured tubo-ovarian abscess Stage V - Tubercular salpingitis Long-standing pelvic inflammation may also lead to: Dyspareunia Infertility Ectopic pregnancy Formation of adhesions like hydrosalpinx, pyosalpinx, tubo-ovarian abscess Chronic pelvic pain Note: Chronic pelvic inflammation leads to dense adhesions between the uterus and the appendages. Thus, it becomes difficult to define the uterus from the pelvic masses. They form a hard mass which is called the frozen pelvis.

Hematogenous spread is thought to be the process by which the tubercle bacilli implant into the mucosa of the fallopian tubes and subsequently affect the endometrium by direct extension. Female genital tuberculosis is an important cause of significant morbidity, short and long-term sequelae especially infertility. Genital tuberculosis usually occurs secondary to pulmonary (commonest) or extrapulmonary TB like gastrointestinal, renal, skeletal, and miliary TB. However, primary genital TB can rarely occur in women whose male partners have active genitourinary TB (e.g., tuberculosis epididymitis) by transmission through infected semen Most common site involved in secondary genital TB is fallopian tube (90-100%) >endometrium (50-80%) >ovaries (20-30%) >cervix 5-15%) >vulva. The most common symptom of genital TB is infertility. Causes of infertility in genital TB: Tubal blockage If tubes are patent, then also infertility occurs due to loss of tubal function. Tubercular endometritis causes uterine scarring resulting in the destruction of the endometrium. Ovarian damage with poor ovarian reserve and volume A laparoscopy and dye hydrotubation (lap and dye test) is the most reliable tool to diagnose genital TB, especially for tubal, ovarian and peritoneal disease. The test can be combined with hysteroscopy. Multiple drug therapy ( ATT regimen provided by DOTS) in adequate doses and for sufficient duration is the mainstay in the treatment of TB including genital tuberculosis.",

The fallopian tubes are the first to be affected. The disease subsequently spreads to other genital organs and the peritoneum. This is followed by the involvement of bilateral pelvic lymph nodes. Vulvovaginal involvement is usually secondary to uterine involvement. The most common presentation of genital tuberculosis in the reproductive age group is infertility.",

Of these, 75% of women present with primary infertility. Menstrual abnormalities are seen in 10-40% of cases. Asymptomatic in 10% of cases. Other symptoms like fever and malaise can be seen. The treatment of infertility in women with genital TB depends on the condition of the endometrium. If the endometrium is receptive and the uterus is normal, then assisted reproductive techniques such as in-vitro fertilisation can be tried. If the endometrium is unfavourable then surrogacy may be considered.",

Genital tuberculosis: It is caused by M. tuberculosis and almost always occurs secondary to primary infection elsewhere in the extragenital states. The sites and frequency of involvement are as follows: Fallopian tubes (90-100%) Endometrium (50-60%) Ovaries (20-30%) Cervix (5-15%) Vulva and vagina (< 1%) Presentation is variable and it can be asymptomatic in 10-20% of cases, infertility, menstrual irregularities, abdominal pain and mass, vaginal discharge, fistula formation, ectopic pregnancy and ascites. The mass is made up of rolled-up omentum that is adherent to the uterus and adnexa. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weakness, anorexia or night sweats may be present. Investigations: CBC, ESR and Mantoux test Hysterosalpingography shows a lead-pipe appearance of the fallopian tube, calcification of the tube, beading and variation in the filling, cornual block, jagged fluffiness of tubal outline and tobacco pouch appearance of hydrosalpinx and pyosalpinx. Laparoscopy establishes the diagnosis of genital TB. It shows tuberculous lesions and perihepatic adhesions (if present). Differential diagnosis: Ovarian cyst, broad ligament cyst or encysted fluid Pelvic inflammatory disease Ectopic pregnancy Carcinoma cervix Elephantiasis of the vulva Pregnancy Puberty menorrhagia and postmenopausal bleeding Fungal infection and sarcoidosis Management: It is treated with anti-tubercular therapy for 6 months (DOT strategy): Indications and contraindications for surgery: Types of surgery include vulvectomy (if vulval hypertrophy is present), removal of the adnexal mass, drainage of pyometra and fistula repair. TAH+BSO is rarely required nowadays. Tuboplasty is contraindicated. Option B: Ovarian tumors usually don't affect menstrual cycles. Though virilizing tumors can cause amenorrhoea, other features of virilization such as hirsutism, flattening of breasts, and enlargement of the clitoris are generally present. Option C: Though ectopic pregnancy may be suspected here, the tube is likely to rupture with exacerbation of pain, bleeding, and peritonitis before six months of gestation. Additionally, the absence of vaginal bleeding/spotting, and the presence of weight loss makes the diagnosis unlikely. Option D: Submucous fibroid is associated with menorrhagia.

Tubal contractions, particularly cornual spasms, can give an incorrect impression of proximal fallopian tube obstruction (a false-positive result) on hysterosalpingography. Laparoscopy with chromotubation is therefore considered to confirm the diagnosis of cornual spasm. Laparoscopy is both diagnostic and therapeutic in this condition. Hysteroscopy is an operative procedure that provides an endoscopic view of the endometrial cavity and tubal ostia via the cervix, performed in the preovulatory phase. It can be diagnostic or therapeutic. It is the gold standard investigation for visualizing the uterine cavity and tubal ostia. Contraindications to hysteroscopy are as follows: Acute genital tract infection (Eg: genital herpes infection) Viable intrauterine pregnancy During menstruation, the view is obscured, and the infection rate is high. Scarred uterus and enlarged uterus of size  12 weeks are relative contraindications. Cervical stenosis can cause cervical tears and uterine perforation. Cardiopulmonary disorder due to increased risk of fluid overload and pulmonary edema.

Normal saline and lactated Ringer solutions are commonly used isotonic, electrolyte-containing fluids in operating rooms for diagnostic hysteroscopy procedures. These solutions can cause volume overload and, if rapidly absorbed in large volumes, may lead to pulmonary edema. Isotonic, electrolyte-containing fluids are contraindicated for use with monopolar electrosurgical devices because they conduct electrical current, dissipate instrument energy and render the instrument ineffective. Low-viscosity, electrolyte-poor fluids such as 1.5-percent glycine, 3-percent sorbitol, and 5-percent mannitol are preferred as they are non-conductive and can be safely used with monopolar electrosurgical energy devices. The primary risk of using hypotonic, hypoosmolar solutions is the intravascular absorption of these fluids, which can lead to acute hyponatremia and hypo osmolality.
