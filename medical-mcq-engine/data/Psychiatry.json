Contributions of Sigmund Freud to the field of psychiatry: Free association Interpretation of dreams Psychoanalysis Psycho-sexual development Psychodynamic theory Topographic theory of the mind - unconscious, preconscious, conscious Structural theory of mind - id, ego, super-ego Cocaine in psychiatry Option A: Concept of free association is a technique in psychoanalysis where the patient is asked to freely share thoughts, random words, and anything else that comes to mind. Option B: Cocaine was introduced in psychiatry as a remedy for morphine and alcohol abuse. Option C: Psychodynamic theory of development explains personality in terms of the interaction between the conscious and unconscious forces of id, ego, and super-ego.",

        "explanation": "The superego is based on the principle of idealism, both in the conscious and unconscious domain. It acts to perfect and civilize our behaviour. The voice of conscience comes from the superego. It is mostly unconscious but also has a conscious component. Sigmund Freud's structural theory of mind divides mental apparatus into the following: Id (new-born) is a reservoir for basic survival instincts, aggression, and survival drives. It is based on the pleasure principle (immediate gratification). It is entirely unconscious. Ego (reality principle) is the executive part of the mind that maintains the balance between id and superego. It is based on exposure to reality and utilizes influences from the external world to modify the id. It is conscious except for unconscious defense mechanisms. Superego (idealism principle) establishes and maintains a moral conscience in an individual by constantly comparing a person’s thoughts and feelings to expected standards of behavior. E.g., While studying, our id wants us to watch a movie instead and our superego wants us to study very hard without taking many breaks. Our ego thus balances between the two and we decide that we will study for few hours and then take a break to watch a movie.",

It is characterized by illogical and primitive thoughts called primary process thinking. It focuses on immediate wish fulfillment and instinctual discharge. Preconscious- composed of mental events, processes, and contents that can be brought into conscious awareness by the act of focusing attention. It contains a barrier called repression. Eg: Although most persons are not consciously aware of the appearance of their first-grade teacher, they ordinarily can bring this image to mind by deliberately focusing attention on the memory. Conscious- part of the mind which is accessible to us. Everything we know about ourselves is in the conscious part of our mind. Perceptions coming from the outside world or from within the body or mind are brought into awareness in this part. Note: The unconscious is the part of the mind that contains repressed thoughts and memories whereas the barrier that censors these (repression) exists in the preconscious part of the mind.",

So, he believed that the interpretation of dreams can revea the contents of the unconscious mind. Free association- when a person is relaxed enough to say whatever comes to their minds without censoring thoughts, a few unconscious thoughts may come out by a slip of the tongue. Note: In psychotherapy, there is a process called abreaction by which repressed material, particularly a painful experience or conflict, is brought back to consciousness by hypnosis or free association.

The Oedipus complex consists of a desire for sexual involvement with the mother and a sense of rivalry with the father. The male child is also scared that if the father finds out, he will castrate him, this is called castration anxiety. The opposite is true for the Electra complex which is the desire for sexual involvement with the father and a sense of rivalry with the mother. The girl child becomes aware of the fact that she does not have a penis, this is called penis envy and she holds her mother responsible for it.

For eg: when water is transferred from a cup to glass, they understand that it is water only and that the volume is the same Develop the concept of reversibility- knowing that one thing can turn into another and turn back. Eg., water and ice Other processes- classification, transitivity Formal operational stage (>11 years): Develop abstract thinking, wherein they can generalize or conceptualize Can make a hypothesis and use deductive reasoning Hypotheticodeductive thinking- the highest organization of cognition, enables persons to make a hypothesis or proposition and to test it against reality",

Negativism- an apparently motiveless resistance to all commands. Posturing- voluntary assumption of an inappropriate and often bizarre posture for long periods of time, against gravity. Waxy flexibility- the patient's limbs can be manipulated to move in any position (flexible like wax), which is then retained by the patient for long periods of time, even if uncomfortable. Stupor- akinesis (no movement) with mutism with relative preservation of conscious awareness. Echolalia- repetition of phrases or words heard. Echopraxia- repetition of actions observed. Ambitendency- tendency to act in opposing ways or directions because of conflicting impulses. e.g. on asking to take out the tongue, the tongue is slightly protruded but taken back again. Gegenhalten- when subjects involuntary resist passive movements. The resistance is directly proportional to the force applied. Also called oppositional paratonia. Mannerism- repetition of normal movements but inappropriately. They are purposeful. E.g., repeatedly saluting the people around. Stereotypy- repetitive, odd, purposeless movements. E.g., making strange movements of fingers repeatedly. Automatic obedience- commands are followed automatically, irrespective of their nature. Assessment in Psychiatry",

Expansive- lack of restraint in expressing feelings, frequently with an over-valuation of one’s significance or importance. Irritable- easily annoyed or angered. Euthymic- mood in the normal range. Affect is the cross-section of mood at a given point in time. It fluctuates with time and context. It can be observed by the clinician. It can be characterized as follows: Quality (or tone) of a patient's affect includes being happy, irritable, angry, agitated, tearful, sobbing, and flat.

CBT is applied to identify these faulty ideas and beliefs, make the patient aware of the underlying assumptions that drive them, and modifying their responses to them. The three components of cognitive therapy are: Didactic aspects: Explaining to patients the cognitive triad, schemas, and faulty logic. The herapist must explain all the aspects of treatment. Cognitive techniques: These involve four steps- Eliciting automatic thoughts - Asking the patient about the thought that causes the emotional reaction in them. Testing validity of the automatic thoughts Identifying the general maladaptive assumptions (a belief that is false and rationally unsupported) Testing the validity of maladaptive assumptions Behavioral techniques like relaxation techniques and desensitization to the stimulus etc. CBT is used in the treatment of anxiety and panic disorders, depression, phobia, OCD, personality disorders, and somatoform disorders.",

Here, the person overcomes anxiety elicited by a situation or an object by approaching the feared situation gradually and in a relaxed state. Systematic desensitization consists of three steps: Relaxation training - patients attain a state of complete relaxation and are then exposed to the stimulus that elicits the anxiety response. The negative reaction of anxiety is inhibited by the relaxed state, a process called reciprocal inhibition. Hierarchy construction - Patients and therapists prepare a graded list (or hierarchy) of fear-provoking scenes in the order of increasing anxiety. Desensitization of the stimulus - Patients proceed systematically through the list from the leas o the most anxiety-provoking scene while in a deeply relaxed state.

The syndrome usually develops on the third day of admission. A patient admitted for an unrelated condition may unexpectedly have an episode of delirium, which is the first sign of a previously undiagnosed alcohol-related disorder. Episodes of delirium tremens usually begin at the age of 30-40 years, after 5 to 15 years of heavy drinking, and are typical after a binge. Gradual withdrawal of alcohol does not cause delirium tremens. However, sudden withdrawal can cause it. Treatment of alcohol withdrawal: For patients showing withdrawal symptoms, chlordiazepoxide 25-50 mg every 2-4 hours can be administered orally. For patients with delirium tremens, 50-100 mg of chlordiazepoxide should be administered every 4 hours. If oral administration of drugs is not possible, intravenous lorazepam can be tried.

Thought insertion- thoughts inserted into a person’s mind by some external agent. Thought broadcasting- the sense that a person’s thoughts are experienced by others - the thoughts are made audible or may be experienced by others through telepathy. Made phenomenon: Made affect- feelings are imposed on that person by an external agent. Made impulses or drives - an impulse for action is imposed on a person by some external agent. Made volitional acts - a person’s actions are controlled by an external agent; the person is a passive participant in the action. Delusional perception- the person attaches an abnormal significance/meaning to a normal perception, which leads to delusional interpretation. The most common delusion in schizophrenia is the delusion of persecution. These persecutory fears of the patient can range from transient doubts to profound convictions that people are plotting to have them tortured or killed. Somatic passivity- tactile or visceral hallucinations that are thought to be imposed on a person's body by some external agent. These symptoms are not specific to schizophrenia and may also be present in other psychiatric disorders.",

It is a severe form of acute dystonia, an extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotics like risperidone. It can be treated by drugs with antimuscarinic activities like promethazine. Dystonia is acute in onset and occurs within 1-5 days of starting treatment. It is more common in the younger population. The proposed mechanism of action is D2 blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway. There is typical involvement of head and neck muscles and presents in a variety of forms, such as torticollis, trismus, mouth opening dystonia, grimacing, dysarthria, oculogyric crisis, blepharospasm, and swallowing difficulties. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic with D2 blocking but strong 5HT2 antagonistic activity. Its main side effects include weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperprolactinemia, dyslipidemia, fatigue, etc. At low doses, extrapyramidal side effects are less, but can be significant in higher doses. Extrapyramidal side effects include; Parkinsonism: Features are bradykinesia, rigidity, variable tremor, masked facies, and shuffling gait. Acute dystonia: Which causes spasms of muscles of the tongue, face, eyes, neck, back, etc. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: Extreme rigidity, fever, unstable blood pressure,myoglobinemia, etc. Rabbit syndrome: Perioral tremors occur as a delayed variant of parkinsonism. Other options: Option A: Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine. Its adverse effects include sedation, light-headedness, confusional state, weight gain, etc. Option C: Olanzapine is also an atypical antipsychotic.

Substance use disorder is defined as a maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment. It is manifested by 2 or more out of 11 criteria occurring within a 12-month period. DSM-5 criteria for diagnosing substance use disorder: Recurrent substance use resulting in failure to fulfill obligations at work, school, or home. e.g., substance-related absences or expulsions from school. Recurrent substance use even in physically hazardous situations e.g., driving an automobile when impaired by substance use. Continued substance use despite having persistent social problems caused by the effects of the substance e.g., arguments with the spouse. Continued substance use despite having a physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused by the substance. The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended. Efforts are made to cut down or control substance use but are unsuccessful. Tolerance - there is markedly diminished desired effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance, hence there is a need for increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication. Withdrawal - developing characteristic withdrawal symptoms for the substance, which can be relieved by taking the same or closely related substance. Craving or a strong desire or urge to use a specific substance. A great deal of time is spent to obtain the substance, use the substance, or recover from its effects. Important activities are given up or reduced because of substance use.",

Korsakoff’s psychosis is a chronic amnestic syndrome that can follow Wernicke's encephalopathy due to thiamine deficiency (secondary to alcoholism). The cardinal features are impaired mental syndrome and anterograde amnesia. Only 20% of patients recover with treatment (whereas in Wernicke's encephalopathy there is complete reversal with treatment). Clinical features: Impaired mental syndrome - especially recent memory Striking inability to form new memories - severe anterograde amnesia Retrograde amnesia is less severe. Present with confabulation as an attempt to cover the memory deficit There is a lack of insight and no intellectual functional loss. Overall intact intelligence Implicit learning (e.g., learning procedures) is preserved. Long-term and immediate memory is normal. Treatment: Thiamine is given 100mg orally two to three times daily for 3 to 12 months. Other Substance Use Disorders",

It consists of a fear that the penis is shrinking or retracting and will disappear into the abdomen. The fear is related to labia, nipples, or breasts in females. It is classified under \"Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder\" in DSM-5. Females are also affected infrequently, with a corresponding belief that their breasts (and/or vulva) are shrinking. Option A: Dhat syndrome is a cultural condition found in the Indian subcontinent. Male patients complain of premature ejaculation or impotence and believe that they are passing semen in their urine. In their tradition, semen is described as a \"vital fluid\". The discharge of this \"vital fluid\" through sex or masturbation is associated with anxiety and dysphoria. It is characterized by the complaint of the passage of dhat (whitish discharge: semen) in urine, multiple somatic symptoms, physical/mental exhaustion, and sexual dysfunction. It is based on the belief that semen is precious and that loss of semen leads to exhaustion and weakness. Option C: Shubo-kyofu is similar to body dysmorphic disorder and is characterized by excessive fear of having a bodily deformity. Option D: Latah (startle reaction) is a syndrome seen in Southeast Asia and Japan. Occurring more often in women, it is typically characterized by the presence of automatic obedience, echolalia (mimicking another's speech), and echopraxia (mimicking another's movement). It is often precipitated by a sudden stimulus, such as a loud sound. Another culture-bound syndrome: Shenkui is native to China, and also exists globally, in which the individual suffers withdrawal-like symptoms including painful brain fog, chills, nausea, and even flu-like symptoms with anxiety, believed to be caused by a loss of semen and orgasm. The symptoms can last for weeks to months after a single orgasm. Trauma and Stress-Related Disorders",

It is the treatment of choice for borderline personality disorder and is effective, especially for those with parasuicidal behavior, such as frequent cutting. Patients are seen weekly, to improve interpersonal skills and decrease self-destructive behavior using techniques involving advice, metaphor, storytelling, and confrontation. DBT is influenced by the philosophical perspective of dialectics: \"balancing opposites\". It helps the individual to find ways to hold two seemingly opposite perspectives at once, promoting balance and avoiding the all-or-nothing style of thinking. Other modalities of treatment include: Mentalization-based treatment. Transference-focused psychotherapy. Drugs – antipsychotics, antidepressants (SSRI, TCA), and mood-stabilizing drugs.",

The classic form of narcolepsy (narcolepsy with cataplexy) is characterized by a tetrad of symptoms: Excessive daytime sleepiness Cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone) Hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations Sleep paralysis Symptoms commonly appear in the second decade of life. Strong emotions (such as laughter and anger) usually act as the trigger for cataplexy. Pharmacotherapy remains the treatment of choice. Modafinil, an a1-adrenergic receptor agonist, is used to reduce the number of sleep attacks and to improve psychomotor performance in narcolepsy. Besides this, imipramine and fluoxetine are also found effective in eliminating cataplexy.",

Gabapentinoids are considered superior to dopamine agonists due to the high frequency of intermediate and long-term augmentation with dopamine agonists, as well as their risk of impulse control disorders. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is an irresistible urge to move the legs when at rest or while trying to fall asleep or an uncomfortable sensation of creeping-crawling feeling. It is worse at night and moving legs or walking reduces discomfort. Uremia, neuropathies, as well as iron-deficiency and folic acid–deficiency anemias can produce secondary RLS. In patients with restless legs syndrome, iron stores are initially repleted, and the aggravating factors are eliminated. If RLS still persists, initial therapy with a gabapentinoid (pregabalin, gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil) is preferred, rather than a dopamine agonist (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine). FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of restless leg syndrome: Gabapentin Ropinirol Pramipexol Rotigotin Note: A dopamine agonist is used as an alternative in patients with increased risk for side effects from gabapentinoids, such as those with obesity and its complications, a past or present history of moderate to severe depression, a disorder causing gait instability or respiratory failure, and a history of substance use disorder.",

Agranulocytosis is a rare, but fatal complication of clozapine. It is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500/mm3, or white blood cell (WBC) count < 2000/mm3. It can initially manifest as a local infection with high-grade fever, sore throat, oral and perianal ulcerations. These symptoms appear rapidly within days to weeks following initiation of drug therapy. Clozapine is generally considered to be more effective than other antipsychotic drugs and is often used in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (poor treatment response to 2 or more antipsychotic drugs).

Diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder is based on the following: A history of the child's delay in achieving early motor milestones. Association with below-normal scores on performance subtests of standardized intelligence tests and normal or above-normal scores on verbal subtests. These children struggle to perform accurately the gross motor activities of daily life, such as jumping, hopping, running, or catching a ball. They also exhibit difficulty in fine motor skills like assembling jigsaw pieces, using scissors, drawing, or tracing. This results in poor performance in sports and even in academic achievement because of poor writing skills. Yet, they excel at verbal skills. Three general areas of deficits contribute to the disorder: Poor predictive control of motor movements Deficits in rhythmic coordination and timing Deficits in executive functions, including working memory, inhibition, and attention.",

Sexual abuse of a child that occurs over a period of time evolves through the following five phases: Engagement- The perpetrator induces the child into a special relationship. Sexual interaction- The sexual behaviors progress from less to more intrusive forms of abuse. Secrecy- The perpetrator threatens the victim not to tell. Disclosure- The abuse is discovered accidentally (when another person walks into the room an sees it) or through the child's reporting it to a responsible adult or via medical attention. Suppression- The child often retracts the statements of the disclosure because of family pressure or because of the child's own mental processes.",

USG is done in an older child (usually >7 years) with enuresis or in those who do not respond to therapy. Active treatment should be avoided in children younger than 6 years of age. Treatment includes the following: Psychological therapy includes motivational therapy (star charts), conditioning therapies like auditory or vibratory alarms (most effective). Pharmacological therapy (imipramine and desmopressin) is intended to treat the symptoms of enuresis and thus is regarded as second-line and is not curative.",

Treatment for nocturnal enuresis may include: Behavioural therapy: Classic conditioning with the bell (or buzzer) and pad (alarm) apparatus is the most effective treatment for enuresis. Dryness is achieved in 50% of the cases. Bladder training with encouragement or reward for delaying micturition for increasing times uring waking hours is useful but considered inferior to bell and pad. Pharmacotherapy: Medications should be considered if behavioural therapy has failed, and if enuresis is causing impairment in social, family, and school function. Desmopressin (an antidiuretic) and Reboxetine (norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) are commonly used drugs. Reboxetine is considered as a safer alternative to imipramine. Psychotherapy: It is indicated in cases with chronic enuresis, to deal with any coexisting psychiatric problems and emotional and family difficulties.",

Case 3: The accused does not know the nature of his act and absence of motive or secrecy and shows unsoundness of mind in this case. Hence he is exempted. Case 4: The delusion is judged as if it is real. The accused thought he was doing his job legally as the state executioner. Hence he is exempted. Case 5: Epilepsy, schizophrenia, and paranoia are exempted in the court of law from criminal liability. In this case, the patient was probably in post-ictal state, and mens rea was absent. Thus, in cases 3, 4, and 5, the accused are medically insane and legally insane. Case 1: The accused killed his children out of severe disturbance. However, as per the law, the disturbance is not considered to impair his thinking capacity. There was also no need for self-defense. Hence he would not be exempted. Case 2: The delusion is judged as if it is unreal (i.e., there is no delusion), because the patient was deluded that the victim had killed his wife, but the motive to attempt the murder was out of revenge which is illegal and hence, the person is not exempted.
