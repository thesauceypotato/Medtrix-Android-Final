The level of consciousness is an important marker for cerebral perfusion. The only clinical indicators of perfusion of the gastrointestinal tract and muscular beds are measures of lactic acidosis (lactate and base deficit) and mixed venous oxygen saturation. Other options: Option A: Central venous pressure (CVP) is the mean pressure in the superior vena cava, used for estimation of preload and right atrial pressure. Normal CVP ranges from 2 to 7 mm Hg (3 to 9 cm H2O). A sick or injured patient with a CVP <3 mm Hg is presumed to be volume depleted and may be given fluids with relative safety. However, CVP is unreliable in assessing volume status or left ventricular function with respect to resusitation.

Depletion of the bile salt pool results in fat malabsorption that presents with steatorrhea. The efficiency of water absorption in the jejunum is 44% and in the is ileum 70%. Resection of ileum causes reduced conservation of fluid. Loss of bile salts into the colon affects colonic mucosa, causing a reduction in salt and water absorption, which increases stool losses. Small bowel motility is three times slower in the ileum than in the jejunum. In addition, the ileocaecal valve may slow the transit.

Refeeding syndrome is a potentially fatal condition that may occur due to rapid and excessive feeding of patients with severe underlying malnutrition due to starvation, alcoholism, delayed nutritional support, anorexia nervosa, or massive weight loss in obese patients. With refeeding, a shift in metabolism from fat to carbohydrate substrate stimulates insulin release, which results in the cellular uptake of electrolytes, particularly phosphate, magnesium, potassium, and calcium. These electrolyte disorders can result in altered myocardial function, arrhythmias, deteriorating respiratory function, liver dysfunction, seizures, confusion, coma, tetany, and death. Severe hyperglycemia may result from blunted basal insulin secretion. It can occur with either enteral or parenteral nutrition but is more common with the latter.",

        "explanation": "Sepsis is defined as a “life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection.” It lies in the continuous spectrum between infection and septic shock. qSOFA score (quickSOFA) is a bedside prompt that may identify patients with suspected infection who are at greater risk for a poor outcome outside the intensive care unit (ICU). It uses three criteria, assigning one point each for ow blood pressure (SBP100 mmHg), high respiratory rate ( 22 breaths per min) altered mentation (Glasgow coma scale, <15). The score ranges from 0 to 3 points. The presence of 2 or more qSOFA points is a simple prompt to identify infected patients outside the ICU who are likely to develop sepsis. The primary method to evaluate the risk of organ dysfunction (sepsis) in patients with suspected infection is by determining the Sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment (SOFA) score; which includes assessment of: Circulation - Systolic BP & need for vasopressors; platelet count Respiration - PaO2/FiO2 & need for mechanical ventilation Mentation - Glasgow Coma Score Hepatic function - Bilirubin Renal function - Creatinine Organ dysfunction is identified by a SOFA score of  2 The SOFA score is limited by its requirement of multiple laboratory tests which makes it complex and time-consuming. In order to simplify the scoring process, the \"Sepsis - 3\" task force recommended the quick sepsis-related organ dysfunction assessment \"qSOFA\" score. SOFA Vs qSOFA : SOFA is a more comprehensive and accurate scoring system which is particulary superior to qSOFA in the ICU setting. qSOFA is a simplified derivative of SOFA for bedside assessment of individuals at risk for sepsis particularly useful outside the ICU. setting (i.e. ward / emergency department). However, note that it was originally designed as predictive tool that calculates the risk of death from sepsis rather than a diagnostic tool. Thereby, the best description of sepsis based on \"Sepsis -3\" task force recommendations would be : Suspected or documented infection with SOFA score  2 Or Suspected or documented infection with qSOFA score  2 Another score that has been used is the NEWS(National Early Warning Score). It ranges from 0 to 20 and is based on respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, use of supplemental O2, temperature, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate and level of consciousness.  5 out of 20 is considered a positive score. Other scoring systems for sepsis: The Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) score is no longer recommended as is it not specific to infection. The Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS) score is not recommended as it is complex and has too many variables.",

Option A: During laparoscopic surgery, an artificial pneumoperitoneum is produced by insufflation of the abdominal cavity with CO2 through a temporary port created by carefully perforating the abdominal wall and peritoneum. As a common practice, blind insertion of a Veress needle is performed to enter the peritoneal cavity. However, in patients with prior abdominal surgeries, there is a higher chance of bowel adhesions and bowel wall injury during blind insertion of veress needle. Therefore the Hasson approach is used for direct visualization while establishing the intraperitoneal access. Option C: Clot formation may take place during laparoscopic surgery as a result of intraoperative bleeding. The routine use of 5000–7000 units of heparin per liter of irrigation fluid helps to avoid the formation of clots. Option D: If there is no contraindication for enteral feeding (e.g bowel resection) and no sign of ileus postoperatively, oral feeding can be initiated 4-6 hours after surgery.

Proper placement of the needle can be determined by the inability to re-aspirate injected saline. The normal insufflation rate is 4-6 litres/min. The use of the open technique for creating a pneumoperitoneum avoids the morbidity related to a blind puncture. To achieve this, a 1 cm vertical or transverse incision is made at the level of the umbilicus, stay sutures are applied, and the fascia is dissected. Free penetration into the abdominal cavity is confirmed by the gentle introduction of a finger. A Hasson trocar, shown below, is inserted and anchored, and pneumoperitoneum is created. This is the Hasson or modified Hasson approach. This method is preferred for patients who have undergone previous abdominal surgeries as the small bowel may be adherent to the undersurface of the abdominal wound.",

Drains are placed at surgical sites to freely collect the air or fluids that may accumulate. This enhances wound healing by preventing the formation of unnecessary cavities. Drains are prophylactic in elective surgeries and therapeutic in emergency surgeries. Drains can be - Open - They are based on the principle of gravity Semi-open - Their action is based on capillary effect Closed - They carry out their actions through suction Suction drains are commonly used in chest, breast, abdominal, thyroid, and plastic surgeries. They remove intraperitoneal secretions, anastomotic leaks, and blood from hemorrhage at the surgical site. Romo Vac drain is a negative suction drain closed drain kept in the subcutaneous tissue. Romo Vac drain is indicated in modified radical mastectomy, subcutaneous swelling excision, and amputations. Special types of drains: Chest drains are connected to an underwater seal to aid the exit of air from the pleural cavity. They are used in pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and hemothorax. After surgical exploration of the bile duct, the sphincter of Oddi goes into spasm. To facilitate drainage of bile, a T tube may be used. Drain insertion site care: The site of insertion of the drain is kept clean by drying and patting the drain insertion site with a clean towel after bath. The dressing is changed daily with folded gauze pieces placed below and above the drain site. Removal of drains: The catheter at the site is milked for residual collections. It is then clamped and the suture holding the catheter is cut. The tube is then gently pulled out and any clots at the perforation end are removed. The time of removal of drains for various conditions is as given below. Drains used in surgeries like thyroidectomy are usually removed within 24 hours. Their main purpose is to cover postoperative bleeding. In a mastectomy, a drain is placed for 5 days to collect serous collections. Drains used to cover the colorectal anastomoses are placed for 5-7 days. Common bile duct T-tube drains are usually placed for 10 days. Drains for infections are removed when the infection subsides or when the content of the drain is minimal. After the drain is removed, a folded gauze is placed over the drain insertion area. The dressing can be removed after 24 hours. The patient may be given an antibiotic ointment to apply over the area for a week.",

Lung-to-head ratio (LHR) is used to assess severity in patients with left-sided CDH. An LHR value of <1 is associated with a very poor prognosis, whereas an LHR >1.4 predicts a more favourable outcome. Option A: Hyaline membrane disease is a syndrome in premature infants caused by developmental insufficiency of pulmonary surfactant production and structural immaturity in the lungs. Option B: Meconium aspiration syndrome is the aspiration of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, which can occur before, during or immediately after birth. Meconium is the first intestinal discharge from newborns, a viscous, dark-green substance composed of intestinal epithelial cells, lanugo, mucus, and intestinal secretions. Option D: During normal delivery, the compression of the rib cage while passing through the mother's vaginal canal helps to remove fluid from the lungs. However, newborns who are delivered via cesarean birth may have excess fluid in the lungs and therefore be hypoxic and develop transient tachypnea.",

Typically in CDH, there is a left-sided posterolateral diaphragmatic defect allowing herniation of abdominal viscera into the chest. 80% of CDH develops on the left side. The following sequence of events in CDH leads to the development of pulmonary hypoplasia. Pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypoplasia are the most important prognostic factors in congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Other poor prognostic indicators in CDH : The presence of liver in the thoracic cavity Early respiratory distress, within 24 h after birth Need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation Herniation to the contralateral lung (right-sided hernia) Treatment of congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Variable period of time (24-72 hours) is to be allowed for stabilization before surgical repair. Immediate respiratory support should be provided, including rapid endotracheal intubation and sedation. Bag and mask ventilation is contraindicated in newborns with congenital diaphragmatic hernia because it causes distension of the stomach which in turn may limit the expansion of the already hypoplastic lung. During surgery, the viscera are reduced into the abdominal cavity, and the posterolateral defect in the diaphragm is closed using interrupted, nonabsorbable sutures. In most cases (80%-90%), a hernia sac is not present. If identified, it is excised at the time of repair.",

        "explanation": "Early respiratory distress, within 6 hours of birth, is thought to be a poor prognostic sign. Features of a Bochdalek hernia: Respiratory distress is a cardinal sign in infants with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Early respiratory distress, within 6 hr after birth, is thought to be a poor prognostic sign. Children with CDH may also have a scaphoid abdomen and increased chest wall diameter. Bowel sounds may also be heard in the chest, with a bilateral decrease in breath sounds. The point of maximal cardiac impulse may be displaced away from the side of a hernia if a mediastinal shift has occurred. Retroperitoneal fat, left kidney, spleen or only the omentum commonly herniates through the defect. If the defect is large, most abdominal contents including stomach may herniate. Diagnosis: Chest radiography and passage of a nasal gastric tube confirm the diagnosis. CDH can be diagnosed on prenatal ultrasonography (between 16 and 24 weeks of gestation) High-speed fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can further define the lesion. Ultrasonography findings: Polyhydramnios Chest mass Mediastinal shift Gastric bubble or a liver in the thoracic cavity Fetal hydrops Differential diagnosis: Eventration Cystic lung lesion (pulmonary sequestration or cystic adenomatoid Malformation) Group B streptococcal sepsis: associated with delayed onset of symptoms and a CDH often on the right side. Pneumothorax: always occurs on contralateral to the side of CDH. Treatment: Variable period of time (24-72 hours) to allow for stabilization before surgical repair The viscera are reduced into the abdominal cavity, and the posterolateral defect in the diaphragm is closed using interrupted, nonabsorbable sutures. In most cases (80%-90%), a hernia sac is not present. If identified, it is excised at the time of repair. Conventional mechanical ventilation, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are the 3 main strategies to support respiratory failure in the newborn with CDH. Good relative indicators of stability are as follows: Requirement for conventional ventilation only Low peak inspiratory pressure Fio2 <50 If the defect is too large, a porous polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) patch is used.",

The next best step is to perform a contrast study to localize the site of obstruction. Small bowel atresias present with intestinal obstruction soon after birth. Bilious vomiting is the dominant feature in jejunal atresia Abdominal distension is more prominent in ileal atresia A small amount of pale meconium may be passed, despite the atresia. P ain abdomen radiographs in a jejunal/ileal atresia case will show multiple air-fluid levels and dilated loops. They don't reliably distinguish small and large bowels in neonates and hence contrast studies are often required to localize the obstruction. Water-soluble enemas (Gastrogaffin, Hypaque) are particularly useful in differentiating atresia from meconium ileus and Hirschsprung disease. Contrast studies also help to rule out distal intestinal obstruction and occasionally may act therapeutically to relieve obstructions. In most cases of jejunal/ileal atresia, the distal end of the dilated proximal small bowel is resected and a primary end-to-end anastomosis is done. If the proximal bowel is extremely dilated, it may need to be tapered to the distal bowel before anastomosis. Other options: Option A: CT is not recommended for neonates owing to the harmful effects of radiation. Option C: USG abdomen does not help to localize the site of obstruction and is more useful in the diagnosis of intussusception, where there is an abdominal mass.

If the intestine fails to return, the infant is born with the abdominal contents protruding directly through the umbilical ring, with an intact sac covering the abdominal viscera, termed an omphalocele. The sac is composed of an outer layer of amnion and an inner layer of peritoneum. It is seen in omphalocele and not in gastroschisis. Omphalocele can vary from a small defect with intestinal contents to a giant omphalocele in which the abdominal wall defect measures 4 cm or more in diameter. It may even contain liver. Omphalocele occurs in association with special syndromes such as: There is a 60% to 70% incidence of associated anomalies, especially cardiac anomalies (20–40% of cases) and chromosomal abnormalities. Exstrophy of the cloaca (vesicointestinal fissure) The Beckwith-Wiedemann constellation of anomalies (macroglossia, macrosomia, hypoglycemia, and visceromegaly and omphalocele) The Cantrell’s pentalogy (lower thoracic wall malformations like cleft sternum, ectopia cordis, epigastric omphalocele, anterior midline diaphragmatic hernia, and cardiac anomalies).",

Psoas abscess is a retroperitoneal abscess, caused due to various etiologies. Previously, tuberculosis of the spine was the most common cause secondary to spreading infection from the digestive or urinary tract, which can cause psoas abscess. Nowadays, Crohn’s disease is the most common cause. Patients present with flank pain, fever and chills, malaise and weight loss. They can have referred pain to the hip, groin or knee. When the swelling extends across the groin and below the inguinal ligament along the course of the iliopsoas, it becomes cross fluctuant across the inguinal ligament. Imaging is done by a CT scan, which shows a low-density mass with surrounding inflammation and infiltration of surrounding fat and gas or air-fluid levels. Treatment is done by percutaneous CT-guided drainage and appropriate antibiotics.

The mass may be apparent at birth or may appear in early childhood due to the increased accumulation of lymph. Since the sac is filled with lymph, it is soft, fluctuating, and brilliantly transilluminant. Treatment: Aspiration of the contents, followed by excision once the sac or capsule gets thickened by fibrous tissue. Single cysts can be treated with sclerosing therapy. Commonly used sclerosants include OK–432 or Picibanil, which is a mixture of group A Streptococcus pyogenes strain, pure ethanol, interferon alpha-2a, and doxycycline. Complete excision is done in case of multiple cysts. Option B: A branchial cleft cyst also presents as soft fluctuant swelling.

The predominant hormones regulating the ebb phase are catecholamines, cortisol, and aldosterone. The following mechanism leads to a reduction in insulin secretion during this phase: Pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1, tumour necrosis factor , IL-6 and IL-8 are produced within the first 24 hours of injury. In the later flow phase, insulin secretion begins to normalize i.e., relatively increases. However, insulin resistance by target cells occurs because of a defect in the insulin receptor/intracellular signalling pathway. Thus, the perioperative period is characterized by a state of functional insulin deficiency.",

        "explanation": "Hypotension in acute spinal injury is due to loss of sympathetic tone. The classic presentation of neurogenic shock is hypotension in the setting of warm, well-perfused extremities in a paralyzed patient. This condition requires intravascular volume expansion and vasopressor support. Option B: High cervical spinal cord injury (SCIs) may have immediate respiratory suppression. This requires airway management and ventilatory support because of paresis of the phrenic nerves. Hypoventilation can occur from paralysis of the intercostal muscles (injury to the lower cervical or upper thoracic spinal cord) or the diaphragm (injury to C3 to C5). Option C: Canadian C-Spine rule and NEXUS are validated clinical decision tools to help determine the need for radiographic evaluation and to clinically clear the cervical spine. NEXUS criteria: There are five criteria included under NEXUS. If a trauma patient meets all five criteria, then no radiography is required and the cervical c-spine collar may be removed. However, if any one of the criteria is met then radiography is done to evaluate further. The NEXUS criteria include: No posterior midline cervical spinal tenderness No evidence of intoxication A normal level of alertness No focal neurologic deficit No painful distracting injuries Option D: Patients with or without neurological deficits should be removed from the backboard as soon as possible. A patient who is allowed to lie on the hardboard for more than 2 hours is at high risk for pressure ulcers.",

Ultrasound evaluation using eFAST to look for pericardium, pleural cavities, and abdomen in combination with plain radiographs of the chest and pelvis will usually identify the source of the bleed. In patients with persistent hypotension due to blunt trauma, the pelvis should be wrapped in a sheet for stabilization until radiography can be done. Evaluation of CVP or ultrasound of the IVC may further assist in distinguishing between cardiogenic and hypovolemic shock. It is mostly fatal if not controlled, and requires immediate management.

A flail chest occurs when a segment of the chest wall does not have bony continuity with the rest of the thoracic cage. This condition results from blunt trauma associated with multiple rib fractures i.e., 2 adjacent ribs or 3 or more ribs fractured in two or more places. The blunt force required to disrupt the integrity of the thoracic cage typically produces an underlying pulmonary contusion as well. On inspiration, the loose segment of the chest wall is displaced inwards, and therefore, less air moves into the lungs. On expiration, the segment moves outwards. This is known as paradoxical respiration. The diagnosis is made clinically, not by radiography. To confirm, the paradoxical motion of a chest wall segment can be observed for several respiratory cycles and during coughing. Voluntary splinting as a result of pain, mechanically impaired chest wall movement, and the associated lung contusion are all causes of hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient is also at high risk of developing a pneumothorax or hemothorax. Treatment: Chest strapping or splinting should be avoided. Currently, treatment consists of oxygen administration, adequate analgesia (including opiates) or epidural analgesia, and physiotherapy. IPPV (Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation) is reserved for patients developing respiratory failure despite adequate analgesia and oxygen.

Rib fracture causes intense pain during breathing and increases the risk of pulmonary infections as the patient is not able to cough forcefully. In mild to moderate cases, pain can be managed by intravenous opioids. In severe cases, patients may require epidural analgesia. In addition to adequate analgesia, chest physiotherapy like deep breathing, frequent coughing, incentive spirometry should be encouraged in these patients.

        "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of trauma with decreased breath sounds and a hyper-resonant note on percussion indicates pneumothorax. The presence of tachycardia, hypotension and elevated JVP is suggestive of tension pneumothorax. Tension pneumothorax develops when there is a parietal or visceral pleural tear. This tear acts as a one-way valve i.e. air enters the pleural space from the lung or chest wall during inspiration but has no way to escape during expiration, leading to the collapse of the affected lung. It is characterized by chest pain, tachypnoea, acute dyspnea, sudden onset hemodynamic compromise (tachycardia, hypotension, low O2 saturation, loss of consciousness), neck vein distention, tracheal deviation away from the side of injury, decreased chest movements on the affected side, hyper-resonance on percussion on the affected side and absent or decreased breath sounds on the affected side. Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis, and treatment should never be delayed awaiting radiological confirmation. Management includes: Immediate management: Needle decompression or needle thoracostomy with a wide bore needle n the 5th intercostal space anterior to the mid-axillary line. In the pediatric age group, the needle thoracostomy location is at the 2nd intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. Definitive management: Tube thoracostomy or chest tube insertion in the 5th intercostal space n the triangle of safety. The triangle of safety is bounded anteriorly by the lateral border of the pectoralis major, posteriorly by latissmus dorsi and inferiorly by a horizontal line at the level of the nipple. The X-ray below shows a left-sided tension pneumothorax. There is a large, well-demarcated area devoid of lung markings on the left side. The yellow arrows are pointing to the tracheal deviation and the mediastinal shift to the right side. Other options: Options A: Pericardial tamponade can mimic tension pneumothorax, but the absence of a tympanic note on percussion rules out its possibility. A patient with pericardial tamponade can present with hypotension, raised JVP, and muffled heart sounds (Beck’s triad), with normal breath sounds and no tracheal shift. Option C: Dullness in percussion at the base of the left inferior angle of scapula in conjunction with tubular breath sounds (Ewart’s sign), chest pain that improves while sitting upright and worsens when lying down and pulsus paradoxus are indicative of pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusion develops into tamponade when the effusion leads to increased pressure, impairing ventricular filling and reducing cardiac output. Option D: Massive hemothorax is the accumulation of >1500 ml of blood or one-third or more of the patient’s blood volume in the chest cavity. The patient will have collapsed neck veins, decreased breath sounds and a dull note on percussion.",

Blast injury is a complex type of physical trauma resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an explosion. Primary blast injuries result from the rapid overpressure or shock waves produced by an explosion. These injuries result from the dramatic changes in barometric pressure projecting outwards from the point of detonation. They predominantly cause damage to air-filled hollow organs of the body from rapid pressure change (barotrauma). This includes the middle ear, lungs, and GIT. The most sensitive and most frequently injured hollow organs are the tympanic membranes > lungs. Blast damage to the lungs is the most common cause of life-threatening injury following an explosion. Solid organs are the most resistant to blast injuries as the parenchymal disruption requires very high levels of overpressure.

Cephalad displacement of the diaphragm results in decreased thoracic volumes and results in elevated peak and plateau pressures.

        "explanation": "This patient has a blunt trauma abdomen. He is hypothermic and he is battling acidosis. Thus, he should be subjected to damage control surgery and must be shifted to ICU for further resuscitation. Damage control surgery is minimal intervention done to stabilize the patient and do the definite surgery later. It centers on coordinating staged operative interventions with periods of aggressive resuscitation to salvage trauma patients sustaining major injuries. 3 Phases : Phase I (Initial Exploration) - This phase consists of an initial operative exploration to attain rapid control of active hemorrhage and contamination. Phase II (Secondary Resuscitation) - This phase focuses on secondary resuscitation to correct hypothermia, coagulopathy, and acidosis. Phase III (Definitive Operation) - It consists of planned re-exploration and definitive repair of injuries. This phase typically occurs 48 to 72 hours following initial and after successful secondary resuscitation. Pringle's manoeuvre can be performed to decrease the active haemorrhage from the liver in a liver laceration. It is done by applying pressure on the portal triad at the Foramen of Winslow. The pressure can be applied either digitally or with the use of a soft clamp. Rapid control of the vessels entering the porta hepatis can be obtained by compressing them in the free edge of the lesser omentum. Porta hepatis is a deep, transverse fissure that is situated on the inferior surface of the right lobe of the liver. Structures entering at porta hepatis: Portal vein Hepatic artery Hepatic nervous plexus Structures exiting the porta hepatis: Right and left hepatic bile ducts Lymphatics The images attached below shows the porta hepatis and the gif demonstrates the pringles manoeuvre. 4 P's in the management of liver injuries are: Push- Compression of the edges of the laceration Pringle- Applying pressure on the portal triad Plug the defects with silicon tubes Pack- Apply packs in and around the liver to arrest bleeding General guidelines for the management of blunt trauma to the liver: Patients who are haemodynamically unstable will require an immediate laparotomy for damage control resuscitation. For the patient who is haemodynamically stable, imaging by CT should be performed to further evaluate the nature of the injury. Most patients with a blunt liver injury who are haemodynamically stable can be managed conservatively. The indication for discontinuing conservative treatment is the development of haemodynamic nstability, evidence of ongoing blood loss despite correction of any underlying coagulopathy and the development of signs of generalised peritonitis. Interventional radiology has an important role in the management of liver trauma and embolisation to control hepatic artery bleeding is safe and effective in a stable patient with no evidence of hollow viscus perforation.

Inflammatory breast cancer is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. It mimics acute mastitis. The hallmark of inflammatory breast carcinoma is the diffuse tumor involvement of the dermal lymphatics within the breast and the overlying skin, often without a discrete underlying tumor mass (peau d' orange appearance). The patient presents with rapidly progressive swelling of the breast, warmth, erythema and edema. A breast lump may or may not be present. A diagnosis of inflammatory breast carcinoma should be suspected when a patient with rapidly progressive swelling with inflammatory skin changes does not respond to antibiotics. The imaging features with ultrasound and a mammograph is non-specific due to the underlying erythema and edema. A biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment includes combined-modality treatment: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy Mastectomy Radiation therapy Hormonal therapy- for ER-positive tumors Trastuzumab for HER-2-positive tumors Option B: Giant fibroadenomas occasionally occur during puberty. These are benign solid encapsulated slow-growing tumors over 5 cm in diameter. It presents as a painless lump in the breast. They are managed by excision via a submammary incision. Option C: Phyllodes tumors usually occur in women over the age of 40 years but can appear in younger women. Phyllodes tumor is mostly benign even though it is also called cystosarcoma phyllodes. It presents as a large tumor with an unevenly bosselated surface. They are usually mobile over the chest wall despite their large size. This tumor does not infiltrate the skin. Nipple retraction is not seen in this condition. Benign lesions can be treated with enucleation or wide local excision. Massive tumours, recurrent tumours and malignant lesions are treated with a mastectomy. Option D: Galactocele are the most common benign breast lesions in lactating women. It is a cystic enlargement of the mammary gland containing milk. They are mostly detected during lactation or in the third trimester of pregnancy but rarely, may also present after stopping breastfeeding. Clinically, the mass is usually firm and non-tender and presents as a solid tumour-like lesion on physical examination. The patient usually notes the lesion during lactation or some period after lactation. Needle aspiration, followed by excision should it recur, is the standard method of treating galactocele.",

        "explanation": "The generalized swelling of the left arm of the patient post-surgery for breast carcinoma is suggestive of post-mastectomy lymphedema. Lymphoedema occurs when interstitial fluid accumulates due to defective lymphatic drainage. It is a common complication of breast cancer treatment, involving axillary lymph node dissection and radiotherapy. Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) reduces the risk of lymphedema significantly. Clinical signs and symptoms are observed in the ipsilateral arm. A significant increase in limb size due to swelling is seen. Other symptoms are heaviness, tightness, numbness, tingling, limb fatigue, and reduced limb mobility. Diagnosis is predominantly based on the clinical swelling of the arm. The girth of the affected arm >2 centimetres than the normal limb, a 200-mL or more increase in limb volume, or a 5% or greater limb volume change are other diagnostic criteria. Management: Limb elevation, elastic arm stockings, and pneumatic compression devices to reduce swelling. Using a low-pH water-based moisturizer to prevent dry skin caused by excess fluid accumulation. Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) by a therapist followed by simple lymphatic drainage (SLD) by the patient daily aids interstitial fluid evacuation. Surgical options include lymphaticovenular anastomosis, liposuction, and debulking. Other options: Option B: Stewart-Treves syndrome refers to lymphangiosarcoma seen in chronic long-standing lymphedema following mastectomy (more than 10 years). They present as single/multiple bluish-red skin and subcutaneous nodules. They can ulcerate and hemorrhage. Option C: Axillary venous thrombosis or Paget-Schrotter disease is seen in patients doing rigorous exercise and in weightlifters. The compression of the subclavian vein at the thoracic outlet causes painful swelling of the arm. Option D: Cellulitis (lymphangitis) is a bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It is characterized by a painful area of erythematous and edematous tissue.",

        "explanation": "The gold standard in breast reconstruction with autogenous tissue is the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap. In DIEP flap, using a microvascular technique, only subcutaneous fat and skin are taken, and no muscle is removed. As the muscle is spared, there is a decreased risk of abdominal wall weakness and its associated complications. Lattismus dorsi flap (LD flap) - does not provide the bulk necessary and an implant is usually required. Transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (TRAM flap): Skin, fat, and muscle are moved to the chest. It is the most commonly used flap. It provides good cosmesis and bulk. An implant is usually not required. Since the rectus abdominis muscle is excised in the procedure, it can lead to abdominal wall weakness and hernias. The easiest type of reconstruction is using a silicone gel implant under the pectoralis major muscle. Capsular contraction is a dreaded complication of silicone implants. In breast reconstruction surgeries, the timing of reconstruction may be immediate or delayed. Impediments to immediate reconstruction include insufficient theatre time and a lack of experienced reconstructive surgeons. In addition, if the patient is likely to need post-op radiotherapy, then a delayed reconstruction using a flap often gives better results.",

Pregnancy-associated breast cancer is defined as breast cancer that is diagnosed during pregnancy or within 1 year postpartum. It is the most common non-gynecologic malignancy associated with pregnancy. Most patients present with a painless mass in the breast with or without bloody nipple discharge. Diagnosis is done by ultrasonography and tissue biopsy. Treatment of breast cancer in pregnancy involves: Mastectomy in any trimester along with chemotherapy in the second and third trimesters. Radiotherapy and hormonal therapies are absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy becaus of teratogenicity. They can be initiated after delivery. Since radiotherapy is a component of breast conservation therapy, it is contraindicated in th first trimester of pregnancy. However, breast-conserving lumpectomy and axillary lymph nod dissection with chemotherapy can be done in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy followed by radiation after delivery.",

        "explanation": "A thyroglossal cyst is the only midline neck swelling that moves with deglutition. This is because the thyroid gland is fixed to the hyoid. Thyroglossal duct cyst: It is a congenital midline neck swelling that typically presents during childhood often noticed after an upper respiratory infection. It represents the persistence of the track of the thyroid gland and can be found adjacent to the midline. The thyroid gland descends early in fetal life from the base of the tongue towards its position in the lower neck. At the time of descent, the hyoid bone has not been formed and the track of the thyroid gland is variable, passing in front, through, or behind the eventual position of the hyoid body. Clinical features of thyroglossal cyst: Classically the cyst moves upwards on swallowing and on tongue protrusion. This indicates attachment to the hyoid bone. Swelling is smooth, soft, fluctuant (cystic), nontender, mobile, often transilluminant. Thyroid fossa is empty, if there is no thyroid in the normal location. C mplications of thyroglossal cyst: The most common complication is infection. Thyroglossal fistula is an acquired condition that either follows infection of the cyst which bursts pen or due to inadequate removal of the cyst. 1% of thyroglossal duct cysts are found to be malignant of which the most common type f cancer is papillary (85%). Neck swellings that move with deglutition are: Thyroid swellings Subhyoid bursitis Dermoid cysts attached to the hyoid bone However, only the thyroglossal cyst moves with tongue protrusion. This is because the duct extends from the foramen caecum of the tongue to the isthmus of the gland. Sistrunk’s operation is performed to excise the cyst and prevent a recurrence. It involves the excision of the whole thyroglossal tract, involving removal of the body of the hyoid bone, and suprahyoid tract through the tongue base to the vallecula at the site of the primitive foramen caecum along with the core of tissue on either side.",

It is also known as struma lymphomatosa or lymphocytic thyroiditis. It is an autoimmune disease that results in the destruction of the thyroid gland and gradual & progressive thyroid failure. Clinical features: Most prevalent between 45-65 years of age More common in females Painless enlargement of the thyroid Hashitoxicosis: When the auto-antibodies attack and damage the follicles, there is a sudden release of thyroid hormones from these follicles. This leads to a transient phase of thyrotoxicosis. Hypothyroidism: Since the follicles are damaged and cannot form the hormones anymore, these patients tend to be in a state of hypothyroidism. Diagnosis: T3 and T4 are low TSH is raised Autoantibodies against: Thyroid receptors Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) Thyroglobulin These patients are managed with thyroid hormone replacement therapy. In patients with long-standing goiter, there is a risk of compressive features and the development of thyroid lymphoma. Such cases can be treated with total thyroidectomy.

Small, round anaplastic cells may be found in some cases and amyloid deposits derived from calcitonin polypeptides are present in the stroma. The given slide below shows medullary carcinoma of thyroid: Option C: Grave's disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by hyperthyroidism due to circulating autoantibodies. The thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins bind to the TSH receptors, causing overgrowth of the thyroid gland and increased thyroid hormone synthesis. Histologically, there is acinar cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia with the absence of normal colloid in the tall columnar epithelium (normally the epithelium is flat with colloid).

It predominantly occurs in women between the ages of 30-40 years. The condition is self-limiting, and management is symptomatic i.e. aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used for pain relief, but steroids may be indicated in more severe cases.

        "correct_option": "d",
        "explanation": "Most of the retrosternal goiters can be removed by neck incision (transcervical approach). Retrosternal goitre is defined as having >50% of the goiter below the suprasternal notch. It can be either primary or secondary. Primary: rare and arises from ectopic thyroid tissue in the mediastinum; receives blood supply from intrathoracic blood vessels. It is not related to thyroid tissue in the neck. Secondary: they are the most common type; an extension of enlarged thyroid from the neck, usually arising from the lower pole of nodular goitre. It receives its blood supply from superior and inferior thyroid vessels. The majority of patients are asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms. If the gland enlarges within the thoracic inlet, the pressure may lead to dysphagia, tracheal compression, and eventually airway symptoms. Pemberton sign can be positive (facial flushing and dilatation of cervical veins upon raising the arms above the head). CECT neck and thorax is the investigation of choice. Over 95% of retrosternal goiters can be removed via a transcervical incision since they are an extension from thyroid tissue in the neck. Other options: Option A: Surgical removal of the retrosternal goiter is indicated in patients with significant airway compression, and in young patients who have symptoms such as dyspnoea or dysphagia. Option B: Median sternotomy approach is indicated in: Primary mediastinal goiter Malignant retrosternal goitre Very large retrosternal goiter Recurrence in the mediastinum For a primary mediastinal goiter whose boundaries are completely within the chest, resection is often achieved through median sternotomy or thoracotomy to ensure that the vessels supplying the tumor are properly ligated. Removing the tumor through a cervical approach can result in uncontrolled bleeding and is generally avoided. Option C: Blood supply to the retrosternal goiter is from the thyroid vessels (secondary retrosternal goiter).",

        "explanation": "The last dose of carbimazole may be given the evening before surgery. Toxic adenoma is a benign functioning thyroid tumour, which usually presents as a toxic solitary nodule. It is an autonomously functioning tumour that does not respond to TSH. Treatment involves antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine. This is followed by hemithyroidectomy as the surrounding normal thyroid tissue regains normal function. Traditional preparation of a thyrotoxic patient aims to make the patient biochemically euthyroid. There are two methods of preparation that can be used: Carbimazole 30-40 mg per day is the drug of choice. When euthyroid (after 8-12 weeks), the dose may be reduced. Beta-blockers, if used preoperatively, must be given on the morning of surgery and continued for a week post-op. Propranolol 40 mg TDS or a longer-acting nadolol 160 mg once daily may be given to achieve beta-blockade. It is important to continue treatment up to 7 days postoperatively. Iodine may be given with carbimazole or a beta-blocker 10 days before the operation. It produces transient remission and reduces thyroid vascularity.",

They are derived from the neural crest cells of the ultimobranchial bodies. Most of the MTCs occur sporadically. However, around a quarter of the cancers are associated with familial MTC, MEN2A, and MEN2B. Patients with sporadic MTC present at an older age, whereas patients with familial MTC usually present at a younger age. Features of MTC include: Painful neck mass with cervical lymphadenopathy Dysphagia, dysphonia or dyspnea if locally invaded Diarrhoea due to increased intestinal motility by serotonin Cushingoid habitus due to ectopic ACTH production Metastasis is blood-borne Microscopically, they consist of sheets of neoplastic cells separated by collagen and amyloid stroma It is diagnosed by careful family history, physical examination, raised calcitonin, CEA levels, and fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the mass. Total thyroidectomy with central neck node dissection is the treatment of choice in MTC patients. External beam radiotherapy can be used in patients with unresectable tumors. Targeted therapy can be considered using vandetanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, and cabozantinib. Prophylactic total thyroidectomy should be considered within 5years of age in MEN2A mutation and within 1year of age in MEN2B mutation.",

A thyroid swelling with elevated calcitonin indicates a medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). MTC can either be sporadic (80%) or familial (RET gene mutation). In case of familial medullary thyroid carcinoma, stimulation with pentagastrin increases the release of calcitonin. This can be used for the screening of medullary thyroid carcinoma.

The Sestamibi scanning is a nuclear-based imaging test used to localize the parathyroid glands. Sestamibi is a monovalent lipophilic cation that accumulates in mitochondria. Due to this, there is a difference in the rate at which it gets washed out depending upon the number of mitochondria in each tissue. Parathyroid adenomas often have a high concentration of oxyphilic cells with high mitochondrial content and they retain tracers and have a slower washout compared to the normal glands. In patients with nodular goiter or functional tumors of the thyroid gland, increased uptake of sestamibi by the thyroid gland makes parathyroid visualization difficult. There are two primary techniques to differentiate sestamibi uptake by abnormal parathyroid and thyroid tissue: Dual-isotope subtraction imaging (with sestamibi and either iodine-123 or 99mTc pertechnetate) - 99mTc pertechnetate is taken up only by the thyroid. The 99mTc pertechnetate scintigram is then digitally subtracted from the sestamibi scan to allow parathyroid localization. Single-isotope dual-phase imaging (with sestamibi alone with early and delayed imaging) - since the rate of washout from the hyperfunctioning parathyroid gland is slower when compared to the thyroid gland.

TBA is a procedure used to control hypercortisolism in Cushing's disease (due to ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma) when resection of the primary tumor is not possible. The loss of feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis following TBA increases CRH. This leads to stimulation of ACTH-secreting corticotroph cells, causing enlargement of the original pituitary tumor or formation of a new one. Nelson's syndrome is associated with a clinical triad of: Hyperpigmentation Excessive ACTH secretion Corticotroph adenoma Screening is done with fasting plasma ACTH levels and MRI brain performed at regular intervals. Prophylactic pituitary irradiation may be recommended to prevent its incidence. The primary treatment is transsphenoidal surgery.

Autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency worldwide. Tuberculosis is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in India. Adrenal crisis requires immediate intervention owing to its high mortality rate. Immediate rehydration is initiated with a saline infusion at 1 litre/hr with continuous cardiac monitoring.

        "explanation": "The patient likely has achalasia cardia and the definitive treatment is Heller's myotomy. Surgical management is the first-line treatment modality. Achalasia or 'failure to relax' in Greek occurs due to the lack of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus (Auerbach's). The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) fails to relax leading to dysphagia, regurgitation of food, and progressive dilation of the esophagus proximal to the constriction. Barium radiology shows hold-up in the distal esophagus, abnormal contractions in the oesophageal body, and a tapering stricture in the distal esophagus often described as a ‘bird’s beak’. Laparoscopic Heller's myotomy is the procedure of choice. Here, the muscles of the lower esophagus and cardia are cut. However, this can cause iatrogenic gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) due to damage to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Thus, newer techniques involve a partial fundoplication like Dor's procedure to reinforce the sphincter and reduce GERD symptoms. Endoscopic myotomy is a newer, alternate procedure. Here, a submucosal tunnel is formed in the mid esophagus region that allows a long myotomy. Option A: Calcium channel blockers can be given in the initial stages of the disease. They relieve the chest pressure that occurs around mealtimes. However, they are not permanent treatments and can be used while waiting for surgery. Option B: Botulinum toxin injection can be used as a treatment in patients who may not be candidates for surgery or dilatation. Limitations to botulinum toxin injections are that the effect is short-lived (6-12 months) and patients often require multiple treatments. Option C: Pneumatic dilatation of the LES has is successful in 75% of patients. It involves using a balloon to stretch the LES and improve competence. It requires multiple sessions and has a low risk of esophageal perforation.",

It mimics symptoms of myocardial infarction and also shows improvement when sublingual nitroglycerin is administered. It causes smooth muscle relaxation of the esophagus. A barium swallow shows a corkscrew esophagus. However, manometry (high-resolution manometry is preferred) is the gold standard test for diagnosis. In classic manometry, if there are simultaneous, multi-peaked contractions of high amplitude (>120 mmHg) or long duration (>2.5 seconds) it is suggestive of diffuse esophageal spasm. On high-resolution manometry, a DCI (distal contractile integral) >450 mmHg is suggestive of DES.

It then courses behind the esophagus to supply blood to the right arm. This causes pressure on the esophagus and results in dysphagia. It is diagnosed by CT angiography. A barium swallow shows fixed narrowing of the esophagus at the level of the aortic arch without mucosal abnormality. Treatment is surgical repair either by reconstruction or ligation of the aberrant right subclavian artery.",

This causes increased gas in the stomach resulting in bloating sensation, abdominal discomfort, and flatulence. This is known as gas bloat syndrome and occurs more commonly with Nissen total fundoplication. Pneumothorax is the most common complication that occurs intraoperatively.",

Symptoms include heartburn, regurgitation and sometimes dysphagia. Obese white men over the age of 60 years represent the highest-risk group. Intestinal metaplasia in the esophagus occurs due to chronic irritation of the esophagus in GERD (option A) since intestinal epithelium is better suited to handling gastric acid exposure. Hence, mucus-secreting goblet cells are characteristic of Barrett's esophagus. Since all metaplasia are reversible, Barrett's esophagus is also reversible (option D). Only 0.2 to 1% of Barrett's esophagus leads to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. Alician blue is used in the staining of the biopsy specimen, as it stains the goblet cells (option C).

A gastric pull-up is done during esophagectomy for esophageal carcinoma. It is a surgical procedure where the stomach is pulled up into the thoracic cavity that now acts as a new passage (conduit) instead of the esophagus. During the esophagectomy, the proximal stomach and lymph nodes are typically resected along with the segment of the esophagus. The gastric conduit is then fashioned by tubularization of the stomach. The right gastroepiploic artery is preserved and the other arteries are ligated to make ample length and mobility for the conduit. It is of utmost importance the right gastroepiploic artery is preserved as ischemia to the stomach will result in anastomotic leakage, stricture, and even dehiscence. The rich supply of submucosal vascular networks can preserve the stomach on this single vessel.

If distal air is present, an upper GI contrast study should be considered to exclude midgut volvulus. Treatment: The initial treatment of infants with duodenal atresia includes nasogastric or orogastric decompression. IV fluids and parenteral nutrition are started to prevent acid-base imbalance. Echocardiography, renal ultrasound, and radiology of the chest and spine should be performed to evaluate for associated anomalies. Definitive correction of the atresia is done by duodenoduodenostomy.

When the infant is given a test feed, visible peristalsis is usually observed moving from left to right, followed by projectile vomiting. Infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis develop a characteristic metabolic abnormality i.e hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria. Persistent vomiting results in loss of hydrochloric acid leading to the development of metabolic alkalosis (due to loss of H+) and hypochloremia (due to loss of Cl-). The kidneys try to compensate for alkalosis by secreting Na+ and HCO3-. However, the loss of sodium stimulates the secretion of aldosterone via the RAAS pathway. The aldosterone causes active reabsorption of sodium in exchange for K+ and H+ ions. Loss of potassium ions leads to the development of hypokalemia. Loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH resulting in aciduria. It is called paradoxical aciduria, since the body initially lost H+ ions due to loss of HCl, and instead of compensating that loss, the body is losing more H+ ions through urine. The cervix sign and nipple sign are signs of CHPS seen on ultrasonography: Double-layered hypertrophic mucosa protrudes into the stomach, creating the so-called nipple ign. The sonographic appearance of the hypertrophied pylorus resembles that of the uterine cervix and is sometimes referred to as the cervix sign. The given ultrasound image shows thickened pylorus, with cervix sign and nipple sign. Treatment: The child should be rehydrated and the metabolic abnormality has to be corrected preoperatively. The Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is the standard surgical procedure for its treatment.",

This fluid shift induces autonomic responses. It is characterized by more GI and fewer cardiovascular effects such as: Epigastric fullne Sweating Lightheadedne Tachycardia Diarrhea Symptoms are aggravated by having more food and relieved by lying down. Late dumping syndrome is due to an increase in insulin levels and secondary hypoglycemia. This hypoglycemia causes a catecholamine surge, which results in predominantly cardiovascular effects such as: Diaphoresi Tremulousne Light-headedne Tachycardia Confusion The symptoms are aggravated by exercise and relieved by having food. The principal treatment for both types of dumping syndrome is dietary manipulation. Meals based on fat and protein are known to work the best. Octreotide before meals is useful.",

The disease seems to be caused by overexpression of transforming growth factor-alpha i.e., TGF-alpha (not TNF-alpha), which stimulates the EGFR pathway, resulting in increased proliferation of mucus cells/foveolar hyperplasia. This results in gross hypertrophy of the gastric mucosal folds, mucus production, and hypochlorhydria. The antrum is usually spared. There is a loss of albumin (up to 10 g/day), across the gastric mucosa leading to hypoproteinemia. Secondary symptoms include weight loss, diarrhea, and peripheral edema. Histologically, it is characterized by hyperplasia of foveolar mucous cells. The glands are cystically dilated and elongated with a corkscrew-like appearance as shown in the image below. Cetuximab, an EGFR inhibitory antibody, is now considered the first-line treatment for Menetrier's disease, leaving total gastrectomy for severe disease with persistent and substantial protein loss refractory to cetuximab.

Bariatric surgery, specifically, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery is associated with the creation of mesenteric defects. The small bowel can herniate through these defects (internal hernia) and get strangulated, resulting in bowel obstruction. In addition, as the person loses weight (due to the bariatric procedure), the protective, space-occupying effect of the mesenteric fat is lost and hernia spaces open up, further increasing the risk of internal hernia. The laparoscopic procedure has a higher risk compared to open surgery since fewer adhesions form to tether small-bowel loops and prevent them from herniating. Adequate closure of the mesenteric defects by the surgeon at the time of operation significantly reduces the risk of internal hernia. Other complications specific to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: Nutritional deficiencies: iron (most common), folate, Vitamin A, D, K and B12 Anastomosis site leak Bleeding from the site of gastrojejunostomy Dumping syndrome Marginal ulcers Increased risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism Option A: Sleeve gastrectomy is often complicated by staple line leak.

The ideal management is exploratory laparotomy as soon as possible with ongoing resuscitative measures until surgery. Bowel strangulation is a type of mechanical bowel obstruction, associated with complete cessation of blood supply leading to irreversible loss of viability of the affected bowel segment. Inguinal hernias, most commonly of non-reducible type, are associated with a high chance of strangulation and need urgent medical intervention. Bowel strangulation can be suspected in the presence of constant severe abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness with rigidity and peritonism, signs of shock, and lack of response to conservative management. Reduced bowel wall enhancement on CT When strangulation occurs in an external hernia, the lump is tense, tender, and irreducible with overlying skin changes (erythema or purplish discoloration). Supportive management: IV fluids Nasogastric tube to decompress the bowel and reduce abdominal distention IV antibiotics (adequate coverage required for gram -ve and anaerobes) Analgesia Definitive management: Continue supportive management up to 72 hrs if suspicious of adhesions. Surgical exploration and adhesiolysis should be done if there is no improvement.

Mesenteric ischemia may be acute or chronic. The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is most likely affected. An embolus is the most common cause of SMA occlusion. Possible sources for SMA emboisation include: Left atrium in atrial fibrillation Previous history of ischemic heart disease/myocardial infarction Vegetations on mitral and aortic valves associated with endocarditis An atheromatous plaque from an aortic aneurysm. Other causes of mesenteric ischemia include: Atherosclerosis of mesenteric vessels Vasculitides Venous thrombosis in factor V Leiden mutation Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia due to alterations in splanchnic blood flow. The most important clue to an early diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia is the sudden onset of severe abdominal pain in a patient with atrial fibrillation or atherosclerosis. The pain is typically in the central abdomen and out of proportion to the physical findings. Associated clinical features include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distension, peritonitis, and the passage of bloody stools. The gold standard for the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia is angiography, and management is laparotomy. The goal of operative exploration is to resect the compromised bowel and restore blood supply via embolectomy. Other options: Option B: A pulsatile abdominal mass is seen in the case of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Acute pain and hypotension occur with rupture of the aneurysm, which requires an emergency operation. Options A and D: Acute severe pancreatitis and peptic ulcer perforation have no association with atrial fibrillation.

Complications of mesenteric cyst include torsion, rupture, infection and hemorrhage into the cyst. U trasonography and CT are used to demonstrate mesenteric cysts. Treatment: Chlyolymphatic cyst is managed by enucleation. Enterogenous cyst is managed by removal of the cyst with resection of the adjacent bowel as it arises as a diverticulum or duplication from the adjacent bowel.

Enteroclysis has a sensitivity of over 90% in the detection of small bowel tumours and is the investigation of choice, particularly for tumours located in the distal small bowel. Advantages of enteroclysis: The contrast is administered at a controlled rate directly in the small bowel, bypassing the regulatory action of the pylorus. The entire small bowel is demonstrated in a distended state, allowing better diagnosis. As a result of the dilatation, the following can be visualised: Mild strictures Small sinus tracts and fistulas Minimal extrinsic compressions Skip lesions Proximal and distal extent of diffuse diseases.

In symptomatic patients, resection is indicated. B-cell lymphomas are more chemosensitive and have high remission rates, with or without surgery. T-cell lymphomas are more resistant to therapy and will progress to symptoms of obstruction or perforation if not resected. Small intestine lymphomas cause complications like haemorrhage and perforation. The best prognostic indicator is a response to systemic therapy.

        "explanation": "The clinical scenario and the radiograph are suggestive of toxic megacolon. Toxic megacolon may present with fever, abdominal pain, and abdominal distension. Abdominal radiography shows transverse or right colonic dilation of >6 cm and loss of haustrations. It is usually associated with ulcerative colitis as indicated by history of chronic bloody diarrhoea. It can be triggered by electrolyte imbalance and narcotics which interfere with gut motility. Features of secondary bacterial infecton and sepsis may be present. It can be complicated by intestinal perforation. It usually resolves with supportive treatment (correcting electrolyte imbalance, fluids, and bowel rest) and medical therapy which includes glucocorticoids, anti-inflammatory drugs, and antibiotics. However, an urgent colectomy is indicated in patients who do not show signs of improvement. Indications for urgent surgery include: Frank intraperitoneal peritonitis, secondary to perforation Life-threatening hemorrhage or increasing transfusion requirements Worsening systemic toxicity Worsening colonic dilatation Other options: Option B: Volvulus occurs when the air-filled segment of the colon twists around the mesentery. The sigmoid colon is the most commonly involved part of the large intestine (90%). The patient can present with abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting. X-ray abdomen shows a bent inner tube or coffee bean appearance. Option C: Ogilvie syndrome, also known as colonic pseudo-obstruction is a functional disorder with colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction. It occurs commonly in hospitalized patients and is associated with narcotics, bed rest and comorbid disease. X-ray shows dilatation of the colon (predominantly transverse colon) with absent mechanical obstruction. Option D: Pneumatosis intestinalis is the presence of gas within the bowel wall seen in any part of the GI tract but most commonly in the jejunum. It is a pathognomic feature of necrotizing enterocolitis. X-ray of the abdomen will show intramural gas in the bowel.",

The condition is usually asymptomatic until complications arise. They may be detected incidentally. On a barium X-ray, the colon with diverticular disease will have a saw-toothed appearance. Colonic diverticula are more often acquired than congenital. They are common in developed countries that have a low fiber diet. A low fiber diet results in low stool volume. As the colon generates higher intraluminal pressure to propel smaller volumes of stools, low stool volumes cause an increase in colonic wall tension and segmentation of the colon. Prolonged colonic contractions and high pressures (directed radially along the colonic wall) results in the formation of pulsion diverticula. The sigmoid colon is the most common site. Note: True diverticulum involves the herniation of all the layers of the intestine whereas false diverticulum involves the herniation of only the mucosa and submucosa.",

Ischemic colitis occurs due to interruption or decrease in colonic blood flow.

Major vascular surgery (both open and endovascular repair), especially involving the abdominal aorta, is a well-known risk factor for developing ischemic colitis. Although any area of the colon may be affected, the watershed areas of the splenic flexure (Griffith’s point) and the rectosigmoid (Sudeck’s point) are the most prone to ischemia because of the often incomplete anastomoses of the marginal artery in these locations. The next most common area afflicted is the cecum, secondary to low blood flow in the terminal branches of the ileocolic artery. Splenic flexure (also known as Griffith's point) is a watershed area between the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. Sudeck point is a watershed area between the sigmoid arterial branch from the inferior mesenteric artery and the superior rectal artery (branch of Inferior mesentric artery). The marginal artery of Drummond runs parallel to the colon, connecting the SMA and IMA circulation - the majority of blood flow to the left and sigmoid colon in case of occlusion of the IMA. Arc of Riolan is a variable collateral vessel that connects the SMA (middle colic vessel) to the IMA (left colic).",

When the preoperative diagnosis is reasonably certain, the widely used incision for appendectomy is known as the gridiron incision. It is made perpendicular to a line connecting the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus, with its center at McBurney's point. When better access is needed, the gridiron incision can be converted to a Rutherford Morison incision by extending the incision obliquely upwards and laterally. Rutherford Morison's incision is suitable for a para- or retrocecal appendix that is fixed. It is an oblique muscle-cutting incision starting from McBurney's point and extending upward and laterally as needed. All layers (skin, subcutaneous tissues, external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis, and the peritoneum) are divided along the incision line. In recent years, the transverse skin crease (Lanz) incision has gained popularity due to improved exposure and ease of extension when necessary. This incision is placed approximately 2 cm below the umbilicus along the midclavicular-midinguinal line, with its length adjusted according to the patient's size and obesity. If required, the incision can be extended medially by retracting or dividing the rectus abdominis muscle (statement 4). When there is uncertainty in the diagnosis, especially in the presence of intestinal obstruction, a lower midline abdominal incision is preferred over a right lower paramedian incision.",

        "explanation": "Explanation: The most common presentation of an abdominal desmoid tumor is an abdominal mass. Desmoid tumors, also known as fibromatosis, aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid-type fibromatosis are locally aggressive tumors that lack metastatic potential. Desmoid tumors can be sporadic in origin or associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. These tumors arise from fibro-aponeurotic tissue and typically are manifested as a slowly growing mass. They present as firm, non-painful, non-tender masses in the abdominal wall, shoulder, hip and limbs, mesentery, and pelvis. They are also associated with trauma, pregnancy, and oral contraceptive usage. The investigation of choice for a desmoid tumor is MRI. It is superior to CT in defining the pattern and the extent of involvement and can determine recurrence after surgery. Diagnosis is established by a biopsy with immunohistochemistry, which stains positive for beta-catenin, actin and vimentin, and negative for desmin, cytokeratin and S-100. Treatment: An initial observation is preferred for stable, asymptomatic, primary or recurrent desmoids, especially if surgery can cause high mortality. Surgical resection with negative margin clearance is reserved for patients with small abdomina wall tumors associated with pain or an increase in size. Tamoxifen and NSAIDs are used as first-line medical therapy. Other systemic treatment options are low-dose chemotherapy, tyrosinase kinase inhibitors, and full-dose chemotherapy Radiotherapy is preferred for candidates unfit for surgery, patients refusing surgery and when surgical resection is associated with high morbidity.",

Resection and primary anastomosis is done in patients who are hemodynamically stable and have pliable, nonedematous, well-vascularized bowel. In this procedure, the segment of the left colon containing the cancer is resected. The remaining colon is cleaned with saline lavage by inserting a catheter through the appendix or ileum into the cecum and irrigating the contents from the colon. Primary anastomosis between the prepared colon and rectum is fashioned subsequently, without the need for a temporary colostomy Stent placement via colonoscope is a temporary measure to obtain time for bowel preparation for primary anastomosis. A stent that traverses the tumor is placed to relieve the obstruction. It is done in partial obstruction and is preferred in old and frail patients.",

Transmesorectal resection involves complete removal of the lymph node bearing mesorectum along with its intact enveloping fascia. It is a curative resection of rectal tumours of the middle and lower thirds of the rectum, either as part of Low Anterior Resection (LAR) or Abdominoperineal Resection (APR). Option A: The majority of colorectal cancers are sporadic. Approximately 5% of all colorectal cancers are attributed to familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer). Option B: The large bowel can tolerate delivered radiation doses of up to 6000 cGy. However, a lower dose of 45 Gy is recommended for colorectal tumours. High levels of radiation targeted a colon tumours would include the small bowel in the treatment field. This results in complications such as radiation enteritis. Option D: The precise location of the rectal tumour is determined using rigid proctosigmoidoscope or flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsy. The other investigations used in rectal cancer include: Digital rectal examination - for assessing the depth of penetration Endorectal ultrasound or MRI - provides an accurate assessment of the extent of invasion of the bowel wall MRI with an endorectal coil - is the investigation of choice to assess the 'T' and 'N' stages CECT - for evaluation of metastasis.",

The type of surgery depends on multiple factors (size, location, age of the patient, etc). However, the general consensus is: Early cancer (T1 and a few T2) is locally excised via the transanal approach. Most rectal cancer is treated by anterior resection and colorectal/coloanal anastomosis. Low extensive tumors are treated by laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection(APR) and permanent colostomy. Hartmann’s operation (option A) is preferred in old and frail patients due to poor anal sphincter and postoperative incontinence.",

After the initial 48-72 hours, pain typically plateaus and hence the patient is treated conservatively with analgesics and a sitz bath. Grade1, grade 2, and some grade 3 hemorrhoids with only an internal component can be treated with simple procedures like rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, infrared and laser coagulation, and cryotherapy. Surgery is indicated in: Internal grade 3 or grade 4 hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids with a significant external component Early grade hemorrhoids not responding to simple procedures Surgical procedures used in the removal of hemorrhoids are: Open (Milligan–Morgan) hemorrhoidectomy Closed (Ferguson) hemorrhoidectomy Stapled hemorrhoidopexy - is circumferential rectal mucosectomy. It is associated with reduced postoperative pain, faster recovery and shorter hospital stay Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation Open hemorrhoidectomy - Artery forceps are applied to the skin-covered external components of the hemorrhoid and traction is given to reveal the internal components. Dissection of the lateral pedicle is performed and finally, the pedicles are transfixed. Mucocutaneous bridges are left intact in this technique. The image below shows the procedure. Closed hemorrhoidectomy - The hemorrhoid is excised with the overlying mucosa. The hemorrhoid is dissected from the underlying sphincter and the mucus defect is then closed. This technique is associated with higher chances of recurrence. This procedure is however quick to perform and less painful. The image below describes the procedure.",

Simple fistulas- include a single tract, subcutaneous tract, and those that involve less than 30% of the external sphincter. They are easier to treat, and have lower chances of recurrence. Complex fistulas- include fistulas involving more than 30% of the external sphincter, with multiple tracts, recurrent fistulas, and those associated with other predisposing factors, such as Crohn disease and radiation treatment. Fistulas can also be classified into high or low-lying fistulas, based on their location with respect to the puborectalis muscle.",

Setons can be classified as draining or cutting. Cutting seton A cutting seton has been used as a staged fistulectomy, especially in high trans-sphincteric fistulas. After the seton is passed during the primary surgery, it has to be tightened at regular intervals, till it cuts through completely. Loose/draining seton In this method, the seton is placed to maintain drainage and create scar tissue around the sphincter so that its edges do not retract after cutting. Option B: Fistulotomy involves opening the fistula tract and possibly dividing the sphincter muscle. It is very effective for simple fistulas with minimal sphincter involvement. Option C: Lateral internal sphincterotomy is a technique used for chronic anal fissures. Option D: In fistulectomy, the fistulous tract is cut out completely. Other surgeries for fistula in-ano include: Endorectal advancement flap- involves closure of the internal opening of the tract, debridement of the tract, and mobilization of anorectal mucosa to cover the defect. It is usually done for complex fistulas. LIFT- Ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract involves identification of the internal opening with suture ligation of the intersphincteric portion of the fistula. The tract and infected gland are then excised and the wound is debrided with curettage. It can be done for both simple and complex fistulas.",

Obstruction is characterized by colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal distension and obstipation. Features of obstruction along with vascular compromise is seen in strangluation. Strangulation occurs in 1% to 3% of groin hernias. It is more common at the extremes of life. Most strangulated hernias are indirect inguinal hernias. However, femoral hernias have the highest rate of strangulation (15% to 20%) of all hernias, and it is, therefore, recommended that all femoral hernias be repaired at the time of discovery. Tenderness is the first sign of strangulation. The first step is the correction of hypovolemia. The treatment of choice is immediate surgery. The fundus is opened first during surgery.",

        "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of a hernia medial to the inferior epigastric artery is suggestive of a direct hernia, for which Lichtenstein mesh repair is the appropriate surgical method for its management. The contents of a direct hernia protrude outward, forward, and medial to the inferior epigastric artery and the deep inguinal ring. Whereas, the contents of an indirect hernia protrude lateral to the inferior epigastric artery. The sac of an indirect inguinal hernia passes from the deep inguinal ring obliquely towards the superficial inguinal ring and then to the scrotum. A direct hernia protrudes through the Hesselbach triangle, which is a zone of weakness for direct hernias. A Lichtenstein mesh repair is currently one of the most frequently used methods for treating an inguinal hernia. It is done for the reconstruction of the inguinal floor in adults. It is an anterior tension-free mesh repair that reduces the chances of recurrence of a hernia. A piece of prosthetic nonabsorbable mesh is used to bridge the defect in this repair. Other surgical methods used for the repair of an inguinal hernia are: Bassini repair - It is done for the reconstruction of the inguinal floor in adults. In this method, a mesh is not used. It is associated with a high recurrence and is not used frequently now. It is used only in cases of hernial strangulation and peritonitis where the use of a mesh is not preferred. It is performed by suturing the transversus abdominis and internal oblique musculoaponeurotic arches/conjoined tendon to the inguinal ligament. Shouldice repair - It is a multilayered repair, where the posterior wall of the inguinal canal is strengthened by continuous sutures. It involves double-breasting of the transversalis fascia. It is associated with a very low recurrence rate. Gilbert repair (plug and patch repair) - It is an extension of Lichtenstein’s original mesh repair and has now become the most commonly performed primary anterior inguinal hernia repair. In this technique, a cone-shaped plug of polypropylene mesh is used. It is deployed like an upside-down umbrella when inserted into the internal inguinal ring to occlude the hernia McVay repair (Cooper's ligament repair) is used for the correction of direct inguinal hernia, large indirect hernia, recurrent hernia, femoral hernias (particularly suited for strangulated femora hernias). In this method, the transversus abdominis aponeurosis is approximated to Cooper's ligament. Stoppa-Rives repair - It is used for the repair of large, recurrent, or bilateral hernias. In this method, a sub-umbilical midline incision is given to place a large mesh into the preperitonea space. Herniotomy - It is used to treat inguinal hernia in a child which occurs due to the presence of a patent processus vaginalis. Therefore in herniotomy, the repair of the inguinal ring is not done.",

Stoppa's repair is an open preperitoneal mesh repair primarily indicated for large, recurrent, bilateral hernias. In Stoppa’s mesh repair, a large piece of mesh is placed in the retro muscular space, over the posterior rectus sheath or peritoneum. This mesh is not sutured in patients with small defects because it is held in place by intra-abdominal pressure (Pascal’s law). This allows the eventual incorporation of the mesh with the surrounding tissues. Alternatively, in larger defects, the mesh can be secured laterally with several sutures.",

        "correct_option": "d",
        "explanation": "The most appropriate mesh used in hernioplasty is a lightweight mesh with large pores. Lightweight meshes generally contain less material and induce a less-pronounced foreign body reaction and decreased inflammatory response, which results in better tissue incorporation, increased prosthesis compliance, and decreased patient discomfort and pain. Meshes with large pores exhibit less inflammatory infiltrate, connective tissue, and scar bridging, which allows increased soft tissue ingrowth. They have greater elasticity and flexibility and also shrink less resulting in lesser adhesions, better tissue incorporation, and decreased patient discomfort and pain. So the best mesh type among the given options is lightweight mesh with large pores. Meshes used in hernioplasty can be synthetic or biological depending on their composition. Synthetic meshes are made from polypropylene, polyester, or PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene). PTFE meshes are hydrophobic with a lower risk of adhesion. Biological meshes are acellular matrix materials derived from humans or animals and have lesser complications. But due to poor collagen deposition and absorption, they rapidly lose mechanical strength and hence their use is restricted to infected environments. Note: To promote better tissue integration, a composite mesh was developed which combines the attributes of polypropylene and PTFE by layering the two substances on top of one another.

Injury to this nerve in the right iliac fossa rarely causes sensory disturbances, as the suprapubic area has a rich nerve supply from other sources too. If the nerve is severed above the anterior superior iliac spine, it can lead to the weakened posterior wall of the inguinal canal resulting in direct inguinal hernia. Iliohypogastric nerve can also get injured following appendicectomy. Injury to the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve results in loss of sensation in the skin of the scrotum of males, and loss of sensation of the mons pubis and labia majora in females. Injury to the femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve causes hypoesthesia over the anterior thigh below the inguinal ligament.",

The next best step is the USG abdomen to diagnose if the anomaly is cystic, fibrous or fistula and it's connections. Omphalomesenteric duct abnormalities: Vitello intestinal duct or omphalomesenteric duct is the connection between the yolk sac and the midgut during embryonic life, which eventually gets obliterated. The persistence of the vitellointestinal duct leads to various abnormalities depending on which part of the duct remains patent. Persistence of the proximal intestinal end of the duct leads to Meckel’s diverticula. Persistence of the distal end near the umbilicus leads to the umbilical polyp or sinus. Persistence of the distal end with mucus retention leads to the cyst, which may be associated with the intestine or the umbilicus by a fibrous band. A fully patent vitellointestinal duct can lead to an enterocutaneous fistula. Patent urachus occurs due to the failure of urachus to obliterate, resulting in a connection between the bladder and the umbilicus. Urachal cyst occurs when the urachus fails to obliterate but there is no connection between the bladder and the umbilicus.

Secondary Budd–Chiari syndrome: when the veins are compressed or invaded by a neighboring esion originating outside the vein. Most common presentation: ascites and abdominal discomfort. Risk factors include-Primary myeloproliferative disorders, anticardiolipin antibodies, hyperhomocysteinemia, and oral contraceptive use. Caudate lobe hypertrophy is seen in approximately 50% of the cases and it is because the caudate lobe drains directly into the IVC. Abdominal ultrasonography with color Doppler is the initial investigation of choice and can demonstrate the absence of hepatic vein flow, spider web hepatic veins, and collateral hepatic veins. The definitive radiographic study is hepatic venography to determine the presence and extent of hepatic vein thrombus as well as measure inferior vena cava (IVC) pressures.",

Colour flow doppler is the initial investigation of choice. Treatment: Initial treatment consists of medically managing the underlying disease process and preventing the extension of the hepatic vein thrombosis through systemic anticoagulation. The associated portal hypertension and ascites are managed in a manner similar to that in most cirrhotic patients. Radiologic and surgical intervention should be reserved for patients whose condition is nonresponsive to medical therapy. Percutaneous angioplasty and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), in combination with thrombolytic therapy, are the preferred strategies to restore the outflow of blood from the liver. Surgical shunting, particularly with the side-to-side portacaval shunt, turns the portal vein into a hepatic outflow tract. Factors contributing to a bad prognosis in Budd-Chiari syndrome: Involvement of all three hepatic veins and/or portal vein Presence of ascites Older age at the time of presentation High Child-Pugh score Chronic disease at presentation Note: JAK2 mutation points to a possibility of polycythemia vera predisposing the patient to hypercoagulable states and the formation of thrombus anywhere in the body.

The cyst is surrounded by a fibrous capsule called pericyst that is derived from the host tissue. The cyst wall is composed of two layers, ectocyst (outer gelatinous membrane), and endocyst (inner germinal membrane). Ectocyst is a laminated membrane, which is acellular. It helps in the passage of nutrients. The endocyst helps in producing the laminated membrane and scoleces. The brood capsules are cellular masses in the hydatid fluid which consists of scoleces. In a definitive host, these scoleces develop into adult tapeworm while in the intermediate hosts these develop into new hydatid cysts. The brood capsules are attached to the endocyst by a pedicle or stalk. The brood capsules may mature and detach from the mother cyst and become the daughter cysts, which are an exact replica of the mother cysts.

This condition is characterised by focal overgrowth of functional liver tissue and the supporting fibrous stroma. Patients are mostly asymptomatic and FNH is often an incidental finding. If patients are symptomatic, they usually complain of abdominal pain. On histological examination, cords of hepatocytes are seen with atypical biliary epithelium scattered throughout. A central stellate scar containing a large artery branching out in a spoke-wheel pattern is also seen.",

Acute cholecystitis is the inflammation of the gallbladder that develops over hours, usually because a gallstone obstructs the cystic duct. In the majority of cases, the process is limited by the stone slipping back into the body of the gallbladder. Clinical features include: Pain in the right hypochondrium with referred pain to the back Fever Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia Jaundice Positive Murphy's sign Positive Boas' sign Murphy's sign: After asking the patient to exhale, the examiner places his hand below the costal margin on the right side at the mid-clavicular line of the patient. The patient is then instructed to take a deep inspiration. If the patient stops breathing and winces with a ‘catch’ of breath, Murphy’s sign is said to be positive. Boas' sign: It is the presence of an area of hyperaesthesia at the site of radiation of the pain to the back, typically, below the scapula. USG and CT scans are helpful in establishing a diagnosis. The gold standard investigation of acute cholecystitis is the HIDA scan. The radioisotope used is Technetium-99m ( 99mTc)-labeled derivative of iminodiacetic acid. The following image depicts the radioisotope scan in which the gallbladder is not visualized even after 4 hours. Unlike bilirubin, iminodiacetic acid (IDA) compounds do not undergo conjugation in the hepatocytes. They are rapidly excreted into the bile. This enables excellent visualization of the bile ducts and gallbladder within 30–60 minutes of injection. Since cystic duct obstruction initiates acute cholecystitis, there is non-visualization of the gallbladder 3 - 4 hours after the intravenous injection of 99m Tc-IDA. This is characteristic of acute cholecystitis. Thus visualization of the GB establishes cystic duct patency and rules out acute cholecystitis.",

        "explanation": "The given clinical scenario with an X-ray showing gas in the biliary tract (pneumobilia) and multiple air-fluid levels indicating small bowel obstruction is suggestive of gallstone ileus. The distal ileum is the most common site to be obstructed in gallstone ileus because it tapers before entering the cecum. Gallstone ileus is caused by the obstruction of the intestinal lumen by a gallstone, leading to a mechanical blockage. Big gallstones will not be able to pass through the normal cystic duct. This causes inflammation of the gallbladder and results in pressure necrosis. This in turn leads to biliary-enteric fistula formation. Plain radiographs demonstrate air-fluid levels consistent with a small bowel obstruction. Rigler's triad is seen in gallstone ileus. It includes: Intestinal obstruction Gas in the biliary tract (pneumobilia) Ectopic gallstone (Radio-opaque shadow in the right iliac fossa) The investigation of choice is the CT scan. Pneumobilia is a ubiquitous finding because the fistula that permitted a stone to pass into the duodenum allows air into the gallbladder and the biliary tree. Initial management involves keeping the patient nil per-oral, IV fluids, IV antibiotics, and analgesics. If there is no strangulation or peritonitis, it can be managed by: Milking the stone beyond ileocaecal junction Crushing the stone Enterotomy to remove the stone If there is perforation or strangulation, resection and anastomosis are done. Cholecystectomy should be performed to avoid future complications. Fistula closure can be performed along with cholecystectomy or it can be performed later (two-stage procedure). Given below is a plain X-ray of the erect abdomen showing air in the biliary tract (pneumobilia). A large gallstone causing gallstone ileus is shown below.",

CBD stone detected during surgery (intraoperatively): Laparoscopic cholecystectomy + laparoscopic CBD exploration should ideally be done in the same sitting to avoid the need for additional operative sitting and anaesthesia. A transcystic approach is preferred usually. If there is a small, friable cystic duct; numerous (more than eight) stones in the common bile duct; and large stones (>1 cm), laparoscopic choledocholithotomy is performed. If laparoscopic choledocholithotomy exploration is not feasible, it would necessitate the need for an open CBD exploration. A T-tube is placed in the CBD after laparoscopic choledocholithotomy or open CBD exploration. It is followed by a cholangiography to exclude retained stone.

ERCP is the next line of management for this patient. Choledocholithiasis is the presence of stone in the common bile duct (CBD) or biliary tree. It can be primary or secondary: Primary stones are formed in the CBD or biliary tree itself and are rare. Secondary stones are passed from the gallbladder to the CBD. They are easier to manage than primary stones. It can be an asymptomatic and incidental finding or present with features such as jaundice (most common), abdominal pain, and fatigue. When there is inflammation of the biliary tree (cholangitis), the patient will have intermittent pain, fever, and jaundice (Charcot's triad). Investigations: Liver function tests will show elevated direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. Abdominal ultrasound is the first imaging modality done and may show gallstones and dilated bile duct (>8 mm). CT is sensitive for CBD stones. It shows stones, location, ductal stricture or block, ducta dilatation, and intrahepatic biliary changes. MRCP is highly sensitive and specific for CBD stones, but it is only diagnostic and intervention cannot be performed. Management: ERCP with sphincterotomy is the procedure of choice, followed by the removal of stones using a dormia basket or placement of a stent. Despite ERCP being an invasive procedure, it has the advantage of being both a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure and is more suited for elderly patients who cannot tolerate anesthesia and surgery. Other options: Option A: Cholecystectomy is not recommended for elderly patients, owing to the risk of old age and associated anesthetic and surgical complications. Option C: Wait and watch approach can be done for asymptomatic patients, and patients with smaller stones. Option D: CT is sensitive for CBD stones, but it is only diagnostic and intervention cannot be performed.",

        "explanation": "The presence of fever and chills, along with the MRCP showing multiple areas of intrahepatic beading is typical of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Option B: Caroli's disease is a rare congenital condition characterized by irregular dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts with a normal extrahepatic duct system. It is common in both sexes and mostly presents before the age of 30 years with abdominal pain, cholangitis, or end-stage liver disease. MRCP shows irregular, cystic dilation of the large proximal intrahepatic bile ducts with a normal common bile duct. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an autoimmune condition characterized by inflammatory strictures involving the intra and extra-hepatic biliary tree. It is a progressive condition that leads to secondary biliary cirrhosis. MRCP or ERCP will show demonstrate multifocal, diffuse dilatation and strictures of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary trees, this pattern is a beading or chain of lakes appearance. Pseudodiverticula of extrahepatic bile ducts are pathognomic of PSC. MRCP is useful in diagnosis and surveillance, while ERCP is reserved for the treatment of dominant strictures and to exclude malignancy. The below image shows a cholangiogram of primary sclerosing cholangitis: The common age group of primary sclerosing cholangitis is 30-45 years. Men are affected twice as commonly as women. Two-thirds of these cases are associated with ulcerative colitis. It is also associated with Riedel’s thyroiditis and retroperitoneal fibrosis. 10–20% of patients develop cholangiocarcinoma. Clinical features of a patient with PSC include pruritis, fever, chills, right upper quadrant discomfort, jaundice, and weight loss. Liver function tests show a cholestatic pattern with an elevation of ALP and GGT and smaller rises in the aminotransferases. Bilirubin values may be variable. Liver biopsy excludes other causes of cholestatic liver disease and defines the stage of PSC. It shows onion skin concentric periductal fibrosis. With disease progression, periportal fibrosis occurs, progressing to bridging necrosis, and eventually biliary cirrhosis. Currently, there is no known effective medical therapy. Surgical management involving resection of extrahepatic biliary tree and hepaticojejunostomy has shown reasonable effects. For patients with advanced liver disease, liver transplantation is the only available option. Other options: Option C: Oriental cholangitis, also known as recurrent pyogenic cholangitis is characterized by recurrent attacks of cholangitis due to bile stasis and stone formation. Patients between 30-40 years and both sexes are equally affected. It is caused due to infections (liver flukes, E.coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Proteus). Patients present with Charcot's triad (intermittent fever, pain, and jaundice). MRCP shows intra or extrahepatic calculi, dilatation of ducts, and strictures. Option D: Biliary carcinoma (cholangiocarcinoma) most commonly affects patients >60 years and presents with fever, abdominal pain, weight loss, and features of obstructive jaundice. MRCP shows irregular narrowing of the bile duct involved by the tumor, with asymmetric upstream dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts.",

MRCP shows fluid collections arising from bile leaks but cannot differentiate these from other causes of fluid collections. ERCP is the best investigation as it has the advantage of being both diagnostic and therapeutic. ERCP is useful post-cholecystectomy as there is a high likelihood of a retained stone and stone extraction and/or temporary stenting may be required.

In idiopathic/immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), the spleen is palpable in fewer than 10% of the patients, and the presence of gross splenic enlargement should raise the suspicion of an alternative diagnosis. Management of ITP: In patients with platelet counts <30,000/L, treatment may be instituted if there are symptoms of life-threatening bleeding. Prednisone at 1 mg/kg is the initial treatment of choice. Rh(D) immune globulin is used only in Rh-positive patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Splenectomy is indicated in patients who have relapsed on glucocorticoid therapy. Relapse patients with intermittent or high platelet count can be managed with anti-Rh0(D) immunoglobulin, IVIG, or with a thrombopoietin receptor agonist. Subcutaneous romiplostim and oral eltrombopag are thrombopoietin receptor agonists used in adults who are at risk of bleeding even after splenectomy. Option A: The acute form is more commonly seen in children following a viral infection, while the chronic form is more often seen in adult women of childbearing years. Option C: The bone marrow examination can be normal or show an increased number of megathrombocytes. Option D: 80% of cases undergo spontaneous remission in children.

The unique characteristic of acid-induced diarrhea is that it is controlled by nasogastric aspiration of gastric secretions. Gastric pH <2.5 and a serum gastrin concentration >1000 pg/mL confirm the diagnosis of Zollinger Ellison syndrome. If the diagnosis remains in doubt, a secretin stimulation test is done.

Duodenal obstruction typically causes non-projectile, non-bilious vomiting in neonates. Plain abdominal radiographs may demonstrate the classic double bubble sign.

        "explanation": "The diagnostic test with the best sensitivity and specificity for chronic pancreatitis is the secretin test. Secretin is a hormone secreted by the small intestines. It normally stimulates the pancreas to secrete a fluid with a high concentration of bicarbonate. Secretin stimulation test is a test that measures the ability of the pancreas to respond to secretin. In order to perform the test, a tube is passed into the duodenum. Secretin is administered intravenously and the contents of the duodenal secretions are aspirated and analyzed over a period of about 2 hours. The test becomes abnormal when  60% of the pancreatic exocrine function has been lost. This usually correlates well with the onset of chronic abdominal pain. Other investigations to diagnose chronic pancreatitis: Pancreatic calcifications can be seen on abdominal X-rays. Endoscopic ultrasound showing the presence of four or more of these following features is highly suggestive of chronic pancreatitis: Presence of stones Visible side branches Cysts Lobularity An irregular main pancreatic duct Hyperechoic foci and strands Dilatation of the main pancreatic duct Hyperechoic margins of the main pancreatic duct An abdominal CT scan is the initial modality of choice for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis. CT or MRI scan will show the outline of the gland, the main area of damage, and the possibilities for surgical correction. The investigation of choice for chronic pancreatitis is MRCP with secretin stimulation. ERCP is the gold-standard investigation. They help in identifying the presence of biliary obstruction and the state of the pancreatic duct.",

Haemosuccus pancreaticus, also known as pseudohaemobilia, is a rare cause of GI bleeding, due to blood originating from the pancreatic duct into the duodenum via the ampulla of Vater. It is usually caused by the erosion of a pancreatic pseudocyst into the splenic artery. In hemosuccus pancreatitis, abdominal pain radiating to the back accompanied by melena is the most typical presentation. The pain usually has an up and down pattern, which means it changes in intensity over time. This is due to the transient closure of pancreatic ducts. Other features include: Hematochezia Hematemesis Anemia Jaundice A palpable pulsatile mass with a thrill murmur Retroperitoneal bleeding Laboratory values show elevated lipase and low hemoglobin levels. The diagnosis is mainly through imaging modalities like upper GI endoscopy, ERCP, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and contrast-enhanced CT scan. CT angiography is the gold standard diagnostic tool. It helps to localize the site of bleed and plan the management accordingly.

Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction or dyskinesia (SOD) is a clinical syndrome in which pain, biochemical abnormalities, and dilatation of the bile duct and/or pancreatic duct are attributed to abnormal functions of the sphincter of Oddi. SOD may result from stenosis of the sphincter or from dysmotility. Scarring or stenosis of the sphincter can result from the passage of stones, pancreatitis, or prior endoscopic sphincterotomies. Milwaukee classification of the sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) : Type I SOD is usually managed by Sphincterotomy. Whether such patients should undergo dual sphincterotomies (biliary and pancreatic) is debatable. Type II SOD is usually assessed by a manometry first, followed by surgical or medical management based on manometry findings. Type III SOD is difficult to manage. Surgical management, such as sphincterotomy has variable outcomes with response rates ranging from 8% to 65%. Medical management in the form of nifedipine, proton-pump inhibitor, botulinum toxin injection, etc. does not have long-term benefits as well.

Patients are usually in their seventh or eighth decade of life and present with abdominal pain or recurrent pancreatitis. This is caused by the obstruction of the pancreatic duct by thick mucin. Some patients have symptoms secondary to pancreatic insufficiencies like steatorrhea, diabetes, and weight loss. IMPNs are of three types: Branch-duct IPMN (BD-IPMN) - affects only the small side branches. It is less frequently associated with malignancy. Main duct IPMN (MD-IPMN) - Affects the main pancreatic duct. Malignant transformation is commonly seen. Mixed-type IPMN - side-branch IPMNs that extend into the main duct",

        "explanation": "The kidney has an extensive lymphatic network. It begins in three plexuses which drain into the lateral aortic nodes. These are located around the renal tubules, under the renal capsule, and in the perirenal fat. The renal arteries are end arteries without collateral circulation. The right renal artery is longer than the left renal artery. This is due to the position of the abdominal aorta which is slightly to the left of the midline. The left renal vein is much longer than the right renal vein. This is due to the position of the IVC which is slightly to the right of the midline. The line of Brodel is the avascular plane of the kidney. It lies between anterior and posterior segmental branches. It is an important access route for both open and endoscopic surgical procedures, as it minimizes the risk of damage to major arterial branches.",

Patients may be asymptomatic or may present with: Dull renal pain Abdominal lump Urinary tract infections Increased angulation of ureters resulting in - Nephrolithiasis Hydronephrosis Radiological diagnosis is by intravenous pyelogram which shows flower vase sign or handshake sign. Symptomatic management is preferred. Heminephrectomy is usually not indicated for horseshoe kidneys with unilateral RCC/ Wilms tumor. This is because it can result in devascularisation due to the unpredictable blood supply of the horseshoe kidney from nearby major vessels.

Nephrogram shows a swiss cheese appearance. On prenatal USG, the presence of either > 3 cysts in unilateral kidneys or > 2 cysts in each kidney is suggestive of PKD. Treatment includes: Long-term dialysis Renal transplantation Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) occurs secondary to a mutation of the PKHD1 gene.

Investigations: Ultrasound is the least invasive technique for diagnosing hydronephrosis. Retrograde pyelography is rarely indicated but will confirm the site of obstruction before corrective surgery. Intravenous urogram (IVU) is helpful only if the obstructed kidney is functional. In IVU, the extrarenal pelvis is dilated and the minor calyces lose their normal cupping. In early stages, there is blunting of calyces followed by its clubbing in the late stages. A renal isotope scan (DTPA or MAG-3) is the best modality to confirm the obstructive dilatation of the collecting system.",

Hence, a Coude catheter is advised over suprapubic catetherization as the immediate next step as larger Fr Coude catheter is helpful in negotiating past the angulation in the prostatic urethra. (Note: In acute urine retention, urethral strictures should be suspected when there is resistance at the urethral meatus as the strictures are more common in distal urethra than proximal urethra) Bladder outlet obstruction is usually the most common cause of acute retention of urine. Its clinical features include: Inability to pass urine Severe suprapubic pain A distended, palpable, and tender bladder Acute urinary retention is managed by placing a urethral catheter as early as possible. Usually in BPH, smaller catheters will not pass through the angulation of the prostatic urethra as they are flexible and kink. Hence in BPH, the Coudé-tip catheter, which has a rigid and angulated tip, can be used to overcome the urethral obstruction. If urethral catheter placement is not successful, suprapubic catheterization should be done. If there is a urethral stricture, a council tip catheter is used to dilate it using a cystoscope, guide wires, and urethral dilators.",

The failure of the balloon to deflate may be caused by: Faulty valve mechanism Blockage of the inflation channel by debris Crystallization of the fluid within the balloon (when saline is used) The next best step in the management of a retained Foley's catheter is to further inflate the balloon with 20mL of water, following which the inflated balloon is ruptured percutaneously with needle under USG guidance. A suprapubic approach is used in males, while in females, either a transurethral or transvaginal route can be used. A cystoscopy should be done to ensure that all fragments are removed. Other methods of approach include cutting the sidearm of the catheter, thereby disabling the valve mechanism, or advancing a ureteric stylet or fine-gauge wire through the inflation port to dislodge debris or puncture the balloon. But these are often unsuccessful. Option A: CT is not routinely used in most settings with retained Foley's. Option B: Injection of ether through the balloon port causes the rupture of the balloon within seconds. But this technique causes significant bladder irritation. Option C: Balloons should not be overinflated until they rupture. This may cause severe pain and could cause bladder rupture.",

Muscle-invasive bladder cancer - invades the detrusor muscle. Diagnosis is by cystourethroscopy (directly visualizing the growth) and biopsy. Management is as follows: Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer: Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) followed by intravesical chemotherapy with mitomycin C or epirubicin Immunotherapy with regular intravesical instillations of Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) in high-risk tumors. Muscle invasive bladder cancer: Radical cystectomy along with urinary diversion procedure and lymph node dissection +/- neoadjuvant chemotherapy Other options: Option B: Cisplatin is an anticancer drug used to treat testicular cancer.

Incomplete infection eradication lead to recurrent attacks and chronic prostatitis. Acute bacterial prostatitis is usually caused by an ascending urinary tract infection (UTI) or reflux of infected urine into prostatic ducts. The most common organism is Escherichia coli. An associated increase in levels of PSA(>4ng/ml) may be present due to prostate inflammation. Catheterization and prostatic massage are contraindicated in patients with suspected acute prostatitis, as they increase the chance for bacteremia and sepsis. Instead, suprapubic tap should be performed to alleviate retention. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is the sequela of inadequately treated acute prostatitis. Diagnosis includes: Three-glass urine test - If the first glass with the initial urine sample is clear, but the second and third samples contain prostatic threads and leukocytes, it indicates the presence of prostatitis. Digital rectal examination - Prostate may be normal, boggy, or tender. Prostatic fluid examination - post-prostatic massage fluid shows pus cells and bacteria.",

The patient presents with fever, perineal pain, chills and rigor, and dysuria. Per rectal examination will reveal a tender, boggy prostate.

Urine examination reveals threads in urine. Management: Patients with systemic signs of infection should be admitted for IV antibiotics, hydration, and monitoring of laboratory parameters. Patients who have no signs of systemic infection, who can tolerate oral intake, and who have no urinary retention can be treated with oral antibiotics. Antibiotics are given for 2-6 weeks to ensure the eradication of the infection as antibiotics don't penetrate the prostate capsule easily. ‘or outpatient therapy: Ciprofloxacin 500 mg oral every 12 hours or levofloxacin 500 mg OD or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole double-strength tablet oral every 12 hours can be used. ‘or hospitalized patients: Intravenous ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin with or without an aminoglycoside (gentamicin or tobramycin) or intravenous beta-lactam with or without an aminoglycoside.

PUV is classified into three types based on Young's classification. Diagnosis is made antenatally with ultrasound, which demonstrates bilateral hydronephrosis above a distended bladder. If the diagnosis is not made antenatally, then neonates typically present with urinary infection or uremia and renal failure. The investigation of choice for a posterior urethral valve is micturating cystourethrography (MCUG). Initially, the obstruction is relieved by catheterization to preserve renal function.

For staging, MRI is the investigation of choice. The first lymph node to be involved is the superficial inguinal lymph node and thus, the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is helpful for evaluating the spread of penile cancer. The management is divided into treatment of the primary tumour and the treatment of the lymph nodes. The main principles of penile cancer surgery are to remove a 1cm margin of normal tissue and have at least a 2cm stump after surgery. Surgery is the mainstay treatment of penile cancer. Chemotherapy regime includes 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. Radiotherapy can be done for inguinal lymph nodes if lymph node dissection is not done.",

The gross specimen shows a well-circumscribed, pale, gray-white, fleshy, homogenous mass, with a lobulated cut surface, usually devoid of hemorrhage or necrosis. Histopathology shows uniform tumor cells with abundant clear cytoplasm, distinct cell borders, and large central nuclei. There is a sparse lymphocytic infiltrate. Classically, they have a fried egg appearance. Other options: Option B: Yolk-sac tumor has a yellowish-white, mucinous appearance. Histologically, they are typically composed of a lace-like (reticular) network of medium-sized cuboidal, flattened, or spindled cells, which generally show less cytologic atypia than embryonal carcinoma. In approximately 50% of tumors, structures resembling endodermal sinuses (Schiller-Duval bodies) may be seen; these consist of a mesodermal core with a central capillary and a visceral and parietal layer of cells resembling primitive glomeruli. Option C: Embryonal cell carcinoma appears variegated with foci of hemorrhage or necrosis. Histologically, the cells grow in alveolar or tubular patterns, sometimes with papillary folds. More undifferentiated lesions may display sheets of cells with cleft-like spaces. The neoplastic cells have an epithelial appearance, are large and anaplastic, and have hyperchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The cell borders are usually indistinct, and there is considerable variation in cell and nuclear size and shape (pleomorphism). Mitotic figures and tumor giant cells are frequently seen. Option D: Teratomas also have a variegated appearance but have cysts reflecting the multiplicity of tissue types. Histologically, collections of differentiated cells or organoid structures originating in all 3 germ layers can be seen. Elements may be mature (resembling various adult tissues) or immature (sharing histologic features with fetal or embryonic tissue).",

The most common cause is trauma and is managed conservatively. The second most common cause is a rupture of a berry aneurysm. CT scan is the investigation of choice. A hyperattenuating material is seen filling the subarachnoid space. Most commonly this is apparent around the circle of Willis, on account of the majority of berry aneurysms occurring in this region. A lumbar puncture should be performed if the CT scan fails to establish the diagnosis of SAH. It will show xanthochromic CSF. Delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) is attributed to vasospasm of the cerebral vasculature typically developing 3–10 days following ictus. It is the main cause of a poor outcome. Management: Endovascular treatment (\"coiling\") is generally preferred over craniotomy and clipping for aneurysms amenable to this approach. The combination of induced hypertension, hypervolemia, and hemodilution (Triple-H therapy) is often utilized to prevent and treat cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

It is elicited by squeezing the glans penis in males and applying pressure to the clitoris or pulling the Foleys catheter in females. Any of these will lead to anal sphincter contraction. Spinal shock is a condition of transient physiologic reflex depression of spinal cord function (motor, sensory, tone, reflexes) below the level of injury. It usually results from a high-impact, direct trauma to the spinal cord. When the level of injury is above T6, it can result in hemodynamic changes such as hypotension and bradycardia (due to loss of sympathetic tone and unopposed parasympathetic function). The resolution of spinal shock occurs over a period of days to months, when the areflexia slowly transitions to hyperreflexia and spasticity. Reflexes return sequentially rather than simultaneously. The resolution of the somatic component of spinal shock is classically signaled by the return of the bulbocavernosus reflex, a polysynaptic cutaneous spinal reflex (mediated by the conus medullaris) which is then followed by monosynaptic deep tendon reflexes (e.g. ankle jerk).",

        "correct_option": "a",
        "explanation": "The use of antiepileptics in late post-traumatic seizure (PTS) patients is recommended. Post-traumatic seizures (PTS) are seizures that result from traumatic brain injury (TBI). They are classified into early and late. Early PTS occurs within 1 week and late PTS occurs after 1 week of trauma (Option C). Early PTS are acute symptomatic events, attributed to a direct reaction to injury and hemorrhage. Risk factors for early PTS are: Younger age (especially <5 years) Moderate to severe head injury (measured by GCS) Acute intracerebral hematoma Subdural / Subarachnoid hemorrhage Depressed skull fractures Diffuse cerebral edema History of alcohol abuse Penetrating head injury Late PTS usually occurs due to underlying permanent structural and physiologic changes within the brain. Patients with late PTS may develop post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). It refers to recurrent and unprovoked PTS that occur at least 1 week after TBI. Risk factors for PTE are: Early PTS Severe head injury Older age (especially >65 years) Focal neurological deficit Intracranial hemorrhage Intracranial infection Abnormalities on EEG Alcohol-related head injury Prolonged seizures (30 to 60 minutes) can cause secondary brain injury, not primary (Option B). Hence, it is imperative to control acute seizures as soon as possible. The initiation of antiepileptics in early PTS patients is to prevent damage due to seizures themselves. It does not reduce the likelihood of developing PTE (Option D). For patients who develop late PTS, because of the high risk of seizure recurrence after the first episode of late PTS, the use of antiepileptic medication is recommended even after a single late seizure episode. The long-term sequelae of head injury are headache, raised ICP, impaired short-term memory, lack of concentration, emotional disinhibition, and depression. Prophylaxis for PTS is indicated in patients at risk of early PTS, for 7 days and is stopped without tapering the dose if no seizures have occurred during this duration. Prophylaxis is not recommended for late PTS.",

Periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes): Pooling of blood surrounding the eyes, associated with fractures of the anterior cranial fossa. Retroauricular or mastoid ecchymosis (Battle sign): Pooled blood behind the ears in the mastoid region is associated with fractures to the middle cranial fossa.

Battle sign and raccoon eyes are both typically not present during the initial evaluation and are delayed by 6 hrs up to 3 days after head injury. CSF leaks may be delayed hours to days after the initial trauma. Fluid suspicious for CSF is confirmed by testing for 2 transferrin. Most CSF leaks are conservatively managed. Persistent leaks >7 days have a heightened risk of meningitis and are often surgically repaired.

It is the most common type of traumatic brain injury, which can result from vehicle accidents, falls, sports injuries, etc. Clinical features of concussion include: Anterograde amnesia/post-traumatic amnesia - a hallmark of a concussion. In this type of amnesia, the events following the injury cannot be recalled. Confusion Headache Dizziness Nausea Vomiting Observation in the emergency department is essential following the clinical exam to look for alterations in mental status or focal neurological signs. The presence of either of which may signal more serious underlying pathology (e.g., intracranial bleeding). Following discharge, the patients are advised to not return to contact sports e.g., football, boxing, etc. which carries the risk of further injury, for at least a week. Then, there should be a gradual, stepwise increase in physical activity. Option A: There are no focal neurological deficits to warrant an NCCT of the brain. Option B: Immediate discharge and return to intense physical activity following mild TBI are inappropriate. Because those who are symptomatic after a head injury, are vulnerable to a repeat impact. Due to disturbed cerebral autoregulation, even a minor second injury may trigger a form of malignant cerebral edema refractory to treatment.

It is also referred to as a mixed tumor due to its combination of epithelial and mesenchymal components. This tumor most commonly occurs in females around the age of 40. Clinical features: Painless, slow-growing swelling Lobulated, firm, variable in consistency Lifts the earlobe No facial nerve involvement Curtain sign positive - cannot be moved above the zygomatic bone. In case of deep lobe involvement, tonsils, and faucial pillars will be pushed medially. Features of malignancy - a sudden increase in size, ulceration of the overlying skin, facial nerve palsy (involvement of facial nerve), painful swelling, and restriction of jaw movements. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is the investigation of choice in diagnosing pleomorphic adenoma. Open biopsy is contraindicated due to the chances of injury to the facial nerve. All tumors of the superficial lobe of the parotid gland should be managed by superficial parotidectomy. Radical parotidectomy is performed for malignant pleomorphic adenoma. Other options: Option A: Adamantinoma is a low-grade malignant tumor that usually presents with pre-tibial pain and swelling since it most commonly affects the tibial diaphysis. Option B: Dermoid cysts present as firm painless subcutaneous nodules and are of 4 types: Sequestration dermoid - sequestration of epithelium during embryological development. Tubulodermoid - accumulation of secretions from ectodermal tube/duct Implantation dermoid - implantation of the epidermis due to trauma Teratomatous dermoid - having all 3 germ layers (ecto, meso, and endoderm) Option D: Sebaceous cysts are retention cysts of the sebaceous glands that present as smooth, non-tender, non-transillumination swelling with a punctum (in 70% of the patients).",

It commonly develops after parotid surgery. It is caused by an aberrant regeneration of post-ganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers crossed along the sympathetic pathways to the sweat glands near the parotid region. Clinical features are due to the result of salivary stimulation (by the smell or taste of food) leading to the sweating and flushing of the periauricular region on the involved side of the face. A starch iodine test is used for diagnosis. Treatment ranges from antiperspirants (in mild cases) to tympanic neurectomy or botulinum toxin injection (in severe cases). It can be prevented by incorporating careful extracapsular dissection and closure of the superficial musculoaponeurotic layer during parotidectomy. Other options: Option A: Facial nerve is the 7th cranial nerve that supplies the muscles of the face, and results in facial paralysis if injured during parotidectomy Option B: Oculomotor is the 3rd cranial nerve which supplies the extraocular muscles.

        "explanation": "After parotid surgery, the nerve involved in the loss of sensation while shaving is the great auricular nerve. The great auricular nerve (GAN) originates from the second and third nerve roots of the cervical plexus (C2-C3). It supplies the skin over the lower pinna, pre-auricular region, and angle of the mandible (image below). The main trunk passes over the sternocleidomastoid and into the anterosuperior portion of the parotid glands and branches into the anterior and posterior GAN. The anterior branch of GAN is often injured during parotid surgery during the initial elevation of the skin flap. When GAN is injured, it can cause reduced sensations in the earlobe, pre-auricular skin, and the angle of the mandible that can interfere with habits such as shaving, wearing earrings, etc. Other options: Option A: The auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve (V3 of trigeminal) supplies the posterior part of the temple, tragus, and adjoining auricle. It does not supply the area where a person is likely to shave. However, the injury to the auriculotemporal nerve resulting in aberrant regeneration would result in Frey's Syndrome (gustatory sweating). Option C: Though the facial nerve is the most common nerve affected during parotidectomy, any damage would result in facial paralysis and not loss of sensation of the face. Option D: The mandibular nerve is a branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) that supplies the skin over the mandible, lower lip, and cheek.

This approach provides a wide exposure to remove larger lesions involving the anterior oral cavity that is not amenable to a peroral approach. This avoids a lip-splitting incision but has the disadvantage of anesthesia of chin/lower lip (due to the sacrifice of submental nerves). The surgical approach selected for excision of oral cavity tumors depends on the size of the tumor, location (anterior vs posterior), proximity to bone (mandible or maxilla), and the need to perform neck dissection. The most commonly employed approaches are as follows: Peroral - accessible early-stage tumors Lower cheek flap - tumors requiring partial mandibulectomy or large posterolateral tumors that cannot be accessed via a peroral approach Upper cheek flap - tumors requiring partial maxillectomy or those involving the hard palate, upper gum, upper gingivobuccal sulcus and anterior soft palate Mandibulotomy - larger tumors of the posterior oral cavity, tumors that involve the base of the tongue or pharyngeal wall. Visor flap - larger lesions of the anterior oral cavity involving the anterior floor of the mouth and lower gum that are not amenable to a peroral approach Commando operation is the combined mandibular resection and neck node dissection. It is used mainly for carcinoma of the tongue.",

The cervical sinus is formed when the 2nd arch mesoderm overgrows the succeeding arches and overhangs them as shown in the image. The space between the overhanging 2nd pharyngeal arch and the 3rd, 4th, and 6th arches is called the cervical sinus. The cavity of the cervical sinus is lined by ectoderm and normally gets obliterated. Branchial cysts are usually lined by squamous epithelium and contain thick, turbid fluid full of cholesterol crystals. It is fluctuant and may transilluminate when it contains clear fluid. A branchial fistula may be acquired or congenital. The congenital fistula is seen at the junction of the middle and lower third of the sternomastoid (option B). An acquired fistula is usually seen in cases of incomplete surgery for the branchial cyst or spontaneous rupture, and it is seen at the same site as the cyst.",

Hydrofluoric acid is the strongest inorganic acid and it can cause liquefaction necrosis of deeper tissues (since the acid is highly lipophilic). Pain out of proportion to physical examination is a hallmark finding in HF burns. Systemic absorption of fluoride ions can result in intravascular chelation of calcium causing hypocalcemia. Depletion of calcium causes inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, leading to hyperkalemia and subsequent life-threatening arrhythmias. Therefore ECG monitoring is imperative. ECG abnormalities that can occur include prolonged QTc (from hypocalcemia) and QRS widening (from hyperkalemia). Following copious irrigation of the burn site with water, the mainstay of treatment is with topical application of calcium gluconate gel. If the pain does not subside, or if systemic signs ensue, an intraarterial injection of calcium gluconate can be given in the affected extremity.",

This is double what the ATLS guidelines advise for other burns as electrical burns may cause myoglobinuria and acute kidney injury. Most of the electrical burns are of severe degree and cause third-degree burns. The fluid resuscitation is done to ensure urine output of 100 mL/hr in adults and 1–1.5 mL/kg/hr in children < 30 kg, until the urine clears from pigmentation. The IV fluid is then titrated down to ensure the urine output of 0.5 mL/Kg/hr. Electrical injuries are usually divided into low and high-voltage injuries. Low voltage injuries cause small, localized, deep burns. High voltage injuries damage by flash (External burn) and conduction (Internal burn) The myocardium may be directly damaged without pacing interruption. Thus, ECG must be monitored for arrhythmias.",

Half this volume is given in the first 8 hours and the second half is given in the subsequent 16 hours. This has been recommended to reflect concerns about over-resuscitation when using the traditional Parkland formula. Adequacy of fluid resuscitation is assessed by monitoring for a urine output of 0.5-1.0 mL/kg/hr. However, in cases of electrical burns, the formula is: Total percentage body surface area burned× weight (kg) × 4 = volume (mL). Parkland and Modified Parkland formula: Parkland's formula for resuscitation in the initial 24 hours is given by = Total percentage body surface area × weight (kg) × 4 = volume (mL).

Colloid-based resuscitation using the Muir-Barclay formula results in the administration of lower volumes of fluid than Parklands formula and carries a lower risk of complications from over-resuscitation.

Blisters are de-roofed and an appropriate dressing is applied. Biological dressing (collagen dressings, amniotic membrane, etc.) is the preferred dressing material, especially in partial thickness burns. If this is not available then a non-adhesive dressing like paraffin gauze impregnated with silver sulfadiazine (SSD) cream, colloidal silver, ionic silver cream, or silver nitrate cream can be applied.

        "explanation": "Contaminated wounds older than 6 hours should be managed with delayed primary closure. The wound is cleaned, debrided, and left open for a few days. This allows soft tissues to drain and also ensures no infection is present before surgical closure can be done. Wound closure is categorized into primary, secondary, or tertiary: Primary closure is done for clean wounds with minimal tissue loss that are amenable to approximation of wound edges. Healing occurs by primary intention. Primary closure is ideally performed within 6 to 8 hrs of trauma, but wounds in vascular areas (e.g. face) may be delayed to up to 24 hours after trauma. Secondary closure allows healing by secondary intention. The wound is left open to heal largely by the formation of granulation tissue and contraction. These wounds often have significant tissue loss precluding tension-free approximation of edges, with devitalized edges. Wound dressings are changed daily to aid in the formation of granulation tissue and subsequent contraction. Tertiary closure, also known as delayed primary closure, results in a combination of healing by primary and secondary intention. The wound is thoroughly irrigated, debrided, and left open for 2 to 5 days before surgical closure. It is used for wounds that are grossly contaminated without significant tissue loss.",

Pressure sores are skin or soft tissue injuries that occur due to prolonged pressure over specific areas of the body. An external pressure of >30 mmHg leads to the formation of pressure sores. The common sites of pressure sores in decreasing frequency are the ischium, greater trochanter, sacrum, heel, malleolus (lateral followed by medial), and occiput. Pressure sores can be prevented with good skincare, the use of air-fluidized beds, special pressure-dispersion cushions, or foams. Repositioning the patient every two hours can lessen the pressure on the area. Ulcers of stages 1 and 2 often do not require operative measures. They are managed with regular wound cleaning and dressing with a good antibiotic cover. Stage 3 and 4 ulcers are adequately debrided, and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) is used to promote the growth of granulation tissue required for surgical closure. Large skin flaps that have muscle with sensory innervation are best for reconstruction.",

During the second postoperative week, fibroblasts proliferate rapidly and begin to produce type I collagen in addition to type III. The strength of the wound is still limited to less than 10% of its final strength. By week 6, the concentration of strong collagen fibers begins to resemble that of intact skin. As the collagen matures and becomes denser, the scar becomes almost acellular as the fibroblasts and blood vessels reduce.The disorganized collagen fibers become aligned along stress lines with their strength being in their weave rather than in their amount. Most of these changes occur over the first three months but a scar will continue to mature for 1 to 2 years. Tensile strength will continue to increase but would not be expected to exceed 60–80% of that of normal skin.",

It is more common in darker-pigmented ethnicities. It can arise from surgery, burns, skin inflammation, infections, ear piercing, and even spontaneously. It occurs 3 months to years after the initial insult with even minor injuries causing keloid formation. It most commonly occurs on the skin of the earlobe, deltoid, presternal, upper back, and rarely extends into the subcutaneous tissue. The histology of keloid scars shows excess collagen and hypervascularity with collagen fibres arranged haphazardly in loose sheets (option C). Treatment: Keloid scars do not improve spontaneously with time and excision alone has a high rate of recurrence (option B). The following can be done: Pressure - local moulds or elastic garments. Silicone gel sheeting. Intralesional triamcinolone injection. Excision and steroid injections. Excision and postoperative radiation (external beam or brachytherapy). Intralesional excision.

Intralesional 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, and verapamil should be used in accordance with established treatment protocols. Refractory cases after 12 months of therapy should be considered for surgical excision in combination with adjuvant therapy. Excision alone results in a high recurrence rate of 50% to 100% and enlargement of the keloid. Immediate postoperative electron beam irradiation or brachytherapy with iridium-192 reduces recurrence rates. The risk of malignancy attributable to keloid radiation therapy is minimal. An additional new invasive treatment modality is internal cryotherapy, in which a metal rod is introduced into the keloid and the subsequent extreme cooling leads to tissue necrosis.",

Angles smaller than 60&deg; are easier to transpose but result in less lengthening and realignment of the scar to less than 90&deg;. Angles larger than 60&deg; should be avoided because the force required to transpose the flaps increases markedly, making the closure of the wound difficult.

Skin tension lines reflect internal tension within the skin and are produced by the parallel alignment of connective tissue of the dermis. Several different skin tension lines have been described. Borge's lines which are also called relaxed skin tension lines are most useful to guide surgical incision. These are often confused with Langer's lines. Langer's lines, also called cleavage lines are topological lines drawn based on the shape of wounds on cadavers. These were not intended as a guide for surgical incisions and they do not always correspond to the best orientation of skin tension and often run perpendicular to skin folds. On the face, these two sets of lines often run at right angles to one another.",

The chest X-ray is the first investigation followed by rigid or flexible bronchoscopy. The cause of death in massive hemoptysis is usually due to asphyxiation (rather than blood loss itself). This is why airway stabilization by intubating into the non-bleeding lung is the priority. After ventilation is achieved, the bleeding site should be identified using bronchoscopy. Bleeding is controlled by laser, bronchial occlusion, or arterial embolization. Surgical resection of the involved area is also done in some cases.

This is gradually replaced by fibrin resulting in thinning of the arterial wall leading to pseudoaneurysm formation. Rupture of Rasmussen's aneurysm can cause massive hemoptysis. CT angiography plays an important role in locating the aneurysm. Most cases of massive hemoptysis arise from the bronchial arterial tree because of high pressure within bronchial arteries.

Normally, lung sliding corresponds to the to-and-fro movement of the visceral pleura on the parietal pleura that occurs with respiration. It is a dynamic sign and can be identified on ultrasound as horizontal movement along the pleural line. In pneumothorax, the air separates visceral and parietal pleura and prevents visualization of visceral pleura. Hence lung sliding is absent and typical to and fro movement and shimmering of the pleural lines will not be present. Comet tail artifacts are seen in the normal lungs due to the acoustic impedance differences between water and air, whereas it is absent in pneumothorax. The image given below shows a sliding sign seen in a normal lung. Option A: The quad sign is seen in pleural effusion. It consists of four lines representing the pleura, rib, fluid, and lung. Option C: The motionless portion of the chest above the pleural line creates horizontal ‘waves,’ and the sliding below the pleural line creates a granular pattern, the ‘sand’. The resultant picture is one that resembles waves crashing onto the sand and is therefore called the ‘seashore sign’ and is present in normal lungs.",

The first line of management in tension pneumothorax is to insert a wide-bore needle in the 5th intercostal space just anterior to the midaxillary line. Pneumothorax is the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space. Tension pneumothorax develops when air enters the pleural space through a point that acts as a one-way valve. More and more air enters with every breath without any way for the air to escape. This is a medical emergency where the patient can quickly deteriorate. A patient with pneumothorax presents with acute dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain. A physical examination will reveal: An enlarged hemithorax Decreased chest movements Hyper-resonance on percussion Absent vocal fremitus Diminished breath sounds In addition to the above findings, a tension pneumothorax would also have the following: Deviation of trachea to the opposite side Distended neck vein Cyanosis Sudden onset hemodynamic compromise: Hypotension Tachycardia Low O2 saturation Loss of consciousness A diagnosis of tension pneumothorax is usually made based on the clinical findings. If the tension in the pleural cavity is not relieved, the patient can die due to hemodynamic collapse. Hence, treatment should never be delayed waiting for radiological confirmation. The management of tension pneumothorax is to convert a tension pneumothorax into a simple pneumothorax. This can be done by rapid decompression using a wide-bore cannula on the affected side, followed by the insertion of a chest tube for definitive management. The safest site for insertion of a drain is in the triangle (Triangle of safety) that lies: Anterior to the mid-axillary line Above the level of the nipple Below and lateral to the pectoralis major muscle Note: If immediate management is asked, the answer will be to insert a wide-bore needle in the 5th intercostal space in the midaxillary line.

A double lumen endotracheal-bronchial tube is placed by the anesthetist for single-lung ventilation. At the end of the procedure, chest drains are placed to allow dependent drainage. The following precautions must be noted before placing the drains: The drain should exit the skin anterior to the midaxillary line. If this is not done then the patient will have to lie on the tube which will cause pain and obstruction of the tube. The course of the drain should be oblique to the skin, chest wall, and pleura, or else it will lead to kinking of the tube. The main advantage of VATS is that a large incision is avoided. This causes less postoperative pain and a rapid recovery. However, VATS procedure limits the ability of the surgeon to palpate the lung to identify occult metastases.",

Intermittent claudication is the debilitating cramp-like pain felt in the leg muscles due to reduced blood flow brought on by peripheral arterial disease. It usually signifies mild to moderate chronic vascular occlusive disease. The pain classically occurs during activity and is relieved with rest. The distance that a patient can walk without stopping till the pain is experienced in the muscles is known as claudication distance. This distance varies only slightly from day-to-day. The muscle group affected is one anatomical level below the arterial disease. Boyd’s classification Class l - Pain on walking but pain decreases on continuation of walking. Class ll - Pain on walking, but continues to walk despite the pain. Class lll - Pain forces the patient to stop walking. Class lV - Pain at rest.

Duplex Scanning is a major non-invasive technique that uses B-mode ultrasound to provide an image of the vessel. Most scanners now have color coding, which allows detailed visualization of blood flow in a vessel. Different colors indicate changes in the direction and velocity of flow, with areas of high flow usually indicating stenotic lesions. Other options: Option A: CT Angiography (CTA) is more useful in the evaluation of visceral arterial disease (eg. mesenteric ischemia). It can be beneficial in peripheral artery diseases where a duplex scan shows poor images (aortoiliac segment involvement). CTA is not routinely recommended in peripheral artery disease because of concomitant renal dysfunction in these patients which can lead to contrast-induced nephropathy. Option B: MR Angiography is time-consuming and expensive, hence not done as the next investigation. It is contraindicated in patients with claustrophobia and metallic implants. Option C: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is an invasive and expensive procedure compared to other investigations. The benefits of DSA are that it provides dynamic arterial flow information and can be combined with a definitive endovascular intervention when indicated. DSA is indicated only when there is a discrepancy in diagnosis or intervention is planned. Complications associated with DSA include bleeding, hematoma, false aneurysm formation, thrombosis, arterial dissection, distal embolisation, renal dysfunction, and allergic reaction.",

During the procedure, anticoagulation is achieved by administration of unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, or bivalirudin (a direct thrombin inhibitor). The femoral artery is punctured under local anesthetic, followed by insertion of a guidewire. The guidewire is negotiated through the stenosis or occlusion under fluoroscopic control. A balloon catheter is then inserted over the guidewire and positioned within the lesion. The balloon is then inflated at high pressure for approximately 1 minute and deflated.

For bypass above the inguinal ligament, while both GSV and PTFE grafts have similar patency rates in the first 2 years, the GSV is superior thereafter and hence preferred over PTFE or any other grafts. The ipsilateral GSV is the conduit of choice for femoropopliteal bypass. When it is not available, contralateral GSV should be used. Other veins are preferred when both ipsilateral and contralateral GSV is not available and they include a small saphenous vein, cephalic vein, and basilic vein. Non-autogenous grafts are used for patients who lack a suitable venous conduit. The most commonly used prosthetic conduit is PTFE.

Digital vascular occlusion may result in ischemia and the \"blue toe\" syndrome; digital necrosis and gangrene may develop. Localized areas of tenderness, pallor, and livedo reticularis occur at sites of emboli. Since the atheroemboli tend to lodge in the small vessels of the limbs and may not occlude the large vessels, distal pulses are usually palpable. Large protruding aortic atheromas are a source of emboli that may lead to limb ischemia, as well as stroke and renal insufficiency. Skin or muscle biopsy may demonstrate cholesterol crystals.

Caused by: Postoperative thrombosis (most common cause) Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) After childbirth Immobility Sites: Pelvic veins—common Leg veins—common in femoral and popliteal veins (common on the left side). Fever is the earliest symptom, which is also most commonly accompanied by pain and tenderness in the calf and thigh (option C). The following signs could be elicited: Positive Homan's sign: Resistance of calf muscles on passive foreceful dorsiflexion of the foot. Mose's sign: Gentle squeezing of the lower part of the calf from side to side is painful. Neuhof's sign: Thickening and deep tenderness seen on deep palpation of the calf muscles. Sometimes, the thrombus may get dislodged and present as pulmonary thromboembolism (option D) with features of dyspnoea, tachypnoea, and chest pain. Clinical features are unreliable for making a definitive diagnosis (option A), and a venous Doppler is the best modality for confirming DVT. It reveals a non-compressible dilated vein. The likelihood of pulmonary embolism can be predicted using modified Wells criteria. Patients with DVT should be immediately started with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). If contraindicated due to renal insufficiency or thrombocytopenia-related conditions, they should be started on fondaparinux (indirect factor Xa inhibitor) or bivalirudin (direct thrombin inhibitor). Anticoagulants should be administered for a minimum period of 3 months. Vena cava filters are used in patients with bleeding risks (like hemophilia).",

The lack of cyanosis differentiates this entity from phlegmasia cerulea dolens. In phlegmasia alba dolens, the thrombosis involves only major deep venous channels of the extremity, thus sparing collateral veins. The venous drainage is decreased but still present. In phlegmasia cerulea dolens, the thrombosis extends to collateral veins, resulting in severe venous congestion with massive fluid sequestration and more significant edema. Both phlegmasia cerulea dolens and phlegmasia alba dolens results from acute massive deep vein thrombosis and can be complicated by venous gangrene.

        "explanation": "Heparin, especially low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is more effective for prophylaxis of DVT in patients who have undergone major surgeries where early ambulation is not possible. The choice of prophylaxis depends on the type of surgery, trauma, and duration of postoperative immobilisation. Major trauma, abdominal and orthopaedic surgeries warrant a longer duration of postoperative immobilisation. So, the pharmacological method is preferred in these situations. Mechanical methods are advised in patients who are expected to be up and walking within 24 to 48 hours such as after minor trauma. The simplest method is for the patient to ambulate. The activation of the calf pump mechanism is an effective means of prophylaxis. Additionally, compression stockings are advised. It can reduce the risk of DVT by exerting graduated pressure on the leg, with the pressure being greatest at the ankle. Advantages of LMWH over unfractionated heparin: LMWH has a longer plasma half-life and significantly higher bioavailability. The consistent bioavailability and clearance of LMWH do not require monitoring of aPTT or anti-factor Xa activity. Dosing is merely based on the patient’s weight. There is a more predictable anticoagulant response than with unfractionated heparin. LMWH inhibits factor Xa and not IIa activity, with the ratio of anti-factor Xa to anti-factor IIa activity ranging from 1:1 to 4:1.",

Important risk factors for varicose veins are: Sex – Females > Males Age – increases with age Pregnancy (especially multiparity) Family history Body mass and height: Increasing BMI (obesity) and height are associated with a high prevalence of varicose veins. There is inconclusive evidence regarding the increased prevalence of varicose veins in smokers, patients who suffer constipation, and occupations that involve prolonged standing. Primary varicose veins are due to genetic or developmental defects in the vein wall that causes diminished elasticity and valvular incompetence.

The detergent destroys the lipid membranes of endothelial cells causing them to shed, leading to thrombosis, fibrosis and obliteration (sclerosis). Injection sclerotherapy alone can be successful in varicose veins <3 mm in diameter and in telangiectatic vessels. Complications of sclerotherapy: Allergic reaction, Local hyperpigmentation Thrombophlebitis DVT Skin necrosis Patients with symptomatic GSV or SSV reflux may be treated with endovenous ablation techniques or surgical removal of the affected vein. Saphenous vein ligation and stripping is preferred therapy for patients with GSVs of very large diameter (>2 cm). Types of sclerosants: Detergents Sodium tetradecyl sulfate Polidocano Sodium morrhuate Ethanolamine oleate Osmotic agents Hypertonic saline Chemical irritants Chromated glycerin Polyiodinated iodine Alcoholic solution of zein Bleomycin Tessari method Widely used method to prepare foam for sclerotherapy Sclerosant : Air ratio taken is 1:3 or 1:4.",

Primary mediastinal lymphoma is an uncommon type of lymphoma. Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), and T-lymphoblastic lymphoma are the most common primary mediastinal lymphomas. In about 50% of patients who have both Hodgkin’s and Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, the mediastinum may be the primary site. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome refers to symptoms produced by the obstruction of blood flow through the SVC by the enlarging mediastinal mass, resulting in symptoms of dyspnea, facial and upper-extremity edema, cough, chest pain, and dysphagia. Video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) is used to obtain a biopsy of the mediastinal mass for confirmation and diagnosis. Chemotherapy with six cycles of R-CHOP regimen is preferred. Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody and has become a standard component of treating all B-cell lymphoma histologies that express CD20. Note: Thymoma is the most common mediastinal tumor in adults (overall).",

They may also occur within the internal organs and connective tissues in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Cavernous lymphangioma or cystic hygroma: They also occur in the neck or axilla. Rarely they may occur in retroperitoneum. Treatment includes surgical excision of the tumor and image-guided sclerotherapy. If there is any residual lymphatic malformation after the treatment, then a conservative excision or unroofing of the cyst is done. It may be combined with sclerosing therapy or repeated partial excisions. Note: The terms lymphangioma and cystic hygromas are older terms. They are now called lymphatic malformations.",

Lymphoedema occurs when interstitial fluid accumulates due to defective lymphatic drainage. It is a common complication of breast cancer treatment involving axillary lymph node dissection and radiotherapy. Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) reduces the risk of lymphedema significantly. Clinical signs and symptoms are observed in the ipsilateral arm. A significant increase in the limb size due to swelling is seen. Other symptoms are heaviness, tightness, numbness, tingling, limb fatigue, and reduced limb mobility. Diagnosis is predominantly based on the clinical swelling of the arm. The girth of the affected arm >2 centimeters than the normal limb, a 200-mL or more increase in limb volume, or a 5% or greater limb volume change are other diagnostic criteria. Management: Limb elevation, elastic arm stockings, and pneumatic compression devices can help reduce swelling. Dry skin can be seen due to fluid accumulation, which can lead to cellulitis/skin infections. Using a low pH water-based moisturizer is helpful. Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) by a therapist followed by simple lymphatic drainage (SLD) by the patient daily aids interstitial fluid evacuation. Benzpyrones and flavonoids are some naturally occurring substances that may be of use to treat lymphedema. Surgical options are lymphaticovenular anastomosis, liposuction, and debulking. Other options: Option B: Stewart-Treves syndrome refers to lymphangiosarcoma seen in chronic long-standing lymphedema following mastectomy (more than 10 years). They present as single/multiple bluish-red skin and subcutaneous nodules. They can ulcerate and hemorrhage. Option C: Axillary venous thrombosis or Paget-Schrotter disease is seen in patients doing rigorous exercise and in weightlifters. The subclavian vein is compressed at the thoracic outlet. Painful swelling of the arm is observed. Option D: Cellulitis usually presents with an ulcer and the skin is erythematous, swollen, and painful. Fever, chills, and rigor follow.",

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is an epithelial tumor arising from basal cells. It is the most common type of skin cancer most commonly seen over the face, above the line joining corner of the mouth, and lobule of the ear. Risk factors for BCC include ultraviolet radiation (strongest risk factor), age 40-80 years with excessive sun exposure, light-skinned people, and exposure to arsenic compounds, coal tar, aromatic hydrocarbons, and infrared light. It is more common in males than females. It is also associated with syndromes such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Gorlin's syndrome. Features of BCC include: Pearly nodule with rolled border Tortuous telangiectatic vessels Surface which can get ulcerated with raised and beaded edge, often with a central depression or umbilicatio Bleeding on minor trauma BCC has various subtypes such as nodular (most common type), pigmented, nodulocystic, morphoeic, infiltrative, and fibroepithelioma of Pinkus. It is locally aggressive and can erode the bone or facial sinuses. It rarely metastasizes via lymph nodes. The occasional presence of melanin in the nodular variant of BCC (pigmented BCC) may lead to confusion with melanoma. Depending upon the type of the lesion, a shave, punch or excisional biopsy may be employed for diagnosis. X-ray or CT may be needed if there is a local invasion. Histology shows peripheral palisading of cells. Treatment: Surgical: Wide excision (4-6 mm clearance) with a skin graft or flap or primary suturing Mohs' surgery for BCC close to the eyes, nose, or ear to preserve more tissue. Non-surgical: Radiotherapy, vismodegib and sonedegib. Other options: Option A: Dermatofibrosarcoma, also known as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare, slow-growing, well-differentiated primary fibrosarcoma of the skin, associated with increased production of platelet-derived growth factor-beta. It presents as a protuberant nodule within a firm, indurated plaque that can ulcerate. They are locally aggressive tumors with high recurrence rates. Treatment is wide excision and Mohs microscopic surgery. Imatinib is used for unresectable, metastatic, and recurrent tumors. The given image below shows a DFSP near the umbilicus. Option B: Marjolin's ulcer is a painless, slow-growing, locally malignant, well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma that occurs in a chronic scar (burns scar, scar of venous ulcer). It presents as an indurated, non-tender ulcer with raised and everted edges with scarring in the surrounding area with marked fibrosis. The ulcer can spread to the lymph nodes when it reaches the normal skin. A wedge biopsy and MRI of the region involved confirm the diagnosis. Management is by wide excision, for larger ulcers, amputation is done. The given image below shows a marjolin's ulcer of the leg. Option D: Naevus is a common benign neoplasm caused due to mutations in the components of the RAS signaling pathway. It has various types, such as congenital naevus, blue naevus, Spitz naevus, halo naevus, and dysplastic naevus. The given image below shows a patient with multiple dysplastic nevi.",

Hutchinson's nail sign is an important clinical clue to subungual melanoma. It is characterized by the extension of brown or black pigment from the nail bed, matrix, and nail plate to the adjacent cuticle and proximal or lateral nail folds. It is also associated with nail dystrophy. Note: Pseudo-Hutchison’s sign is a reflection of the pigmentation of the nail bed and nail matrix through the transparent nail folds. Option A: Subungal hematoma is a close differential of subungual melanoma. It is seen secondary to trauma which causes bleeding and resultant hematoma formation and pigmentation. It is important to note that the features of Hutchinson's nail sign are not seen with subungual hematoma. Option B: Nodular melanoma is a condition where malignant melanoma cells proliferate downwards through the skin – this is known as vertical growth. The lesion presents as a nodule that has been rapidly enlarging. Option D: Lentigo maligna is an early form of melanoma, in which the malignant cells are confined to the tissue of origin, the epidermis, hence it is often reported as in-situ melanoma. Note: Subungual melanoma can be either superficial spreading melanoma or acral lentiginous melanoma. A difference of opinion has been noted in Bailey and Love, 27th ed. where it has been mentioned that melanoma under the fingernail is usually superficial spreading melanoma. However, most dermatology textbooks including the Rooks 9th ed. and Fitzpatrick's 9th ed and several research articles mentioned subungual melanoma as a variant of acral lentiginous melanoma.",
