When the —OH group on the penultimate carbon atom of the sugar is on the right side, then the sugar is designated as a D- isomer. When the –OH group is on the left, it is an L-isomer. Naturally occurring monosaccharides are D-sugars and naturally occurring amino acids are L-isomers. Racemase enzyme interconverts between D and L isomers.

The deficient enzyme is glucocerebrosidase (also known as beta-glucosidase). I Gaucher's disease is an inborn error of metabolism caused due to a deficiency of beta glucocerebrosidase. It is the most common lysosomal storage disorder and the mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive. There is an accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the spleen, liver, and other tissues. There are three clinical subtypes - type I (chronic non-neuronopathic), type II (acute neuronopathic), and type III (intermediate). Clinical features include anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and neurological features depending on the subtype. Gaucher's cells - These are formed as a result of the accumulation of massive amounts of glucocerebrosides within the phagocytes. The cells have a fibrillary cytoplasm and give a crumpled tissue paper appearance. Option A: Deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A is seen in Tay-Sachs disease. The deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A and B causes Sandhoff's disease. Clinical features are seizures, macrocephaly, and hyperacusis. Option C: Deficiency of sphingomyelinase leads to Niemann-Pick disease. It is characterized by the presence of foam cells in the bone marrow. There may be pulmonary infiltrates leading to lung failure. Option D: Deficiency of N-acetylglucosaminidase leads to Sanfillipo's disease. It is a type of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS - III). There is an accumulation of heparan sulfate leading to severe cognitive degeneration. Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis",

Besides, this enhanced glycolysis enables the cancer cells to proliferate in the reduced oxygen tension conditions, which is seen in tumors. This switch from aerobic to anaerobic glucose metabolism also acts as an impetus to tumorigenesis. The increased glucose consumption is used as a carbon source for anabolic processes needed to support cell proliferation such as the de novo generation of nucleotides, lipids, and proteins. Also, the major isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase in cancer cells is PK-2 (in contrast to PK-1 in normal cells), which appears to play a role in the Warburg effect.

If acetyl-CoA accumulates, it acts as an activator of pyruvate carboxylase and an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase, thereby ensuring an adequate supply of oxaloacetate. Other anaplerotic reactions are: Compounds that are metabolized to yield propionyl CoA, which can be then carboxylated and isomerized to succinyl CoA. Glutamate and glutamine are important anaplerotic substrates because they yield -ketoglutarate as a result of the reactions catalyzed by glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase.

The amino acid has two ionizable groups: an amino group and a carboxyl group. The above graph resembles the titration curve of the amino acid glycine. Titration curve of Glycine: The titration is completed at a pH of 12, where the glycine predominantly exists in the form of H2N - CH2 - COO-. pK1 and pK2 correspond to the point where the buffering capacity is maximum. Characteristics of the titration curve: Buffering capacity is referred to as the ability of the aminoacid to resist the change in pH due to the addition of acid (H+) or base (OH- equivalents), by accepting or losing the protons respectively. An ionizable group refers to the group which can either lose or accept a proton and becomes negatively charged or positively charged ion respectively. During the titration, the buffering capacity of the compound reaches its maximum, at points where the pKa of the ionizable groups is reached. Each of these pKa are labeled as pK1, pK2, pK3, etc. The presence of two pKas indicates that the compound has two ionizable groups. Ex. Glycine. The presence of three or more pKas indicates the presence of side chains on the amino acid, with additional ionizable groups. Ex. histidine has three ionizable groups, an amino group, an imidazole group (on the side chain), and a carboxyl group.

If this fails then patients are usually started on chelation therapy with penicillamine.",

The defect in this enzyme leads to the accumulation of homogentisate, which is then excreted in the urine. The excreted homogentisate gets oxidized when exposed to the air and causes the urine to turn black. In some cases, the excessive homogentisate may get oxidized to benzoquinone acetate, which binds to the connective tissue.

This process may be reversible under ideal conditions, such that the protein refolds into its original structure when the denaturing agent is removed.",

It is the most frequent urea cycle defect. Biochemical findings include elevated levels of glutamine in the blood, urine, CSF, low citrulline, and high urinary orotic acid. This condition may be precipitated by a switch from formula to whole milk. Urea cycle disorders are all characterized by hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, and respiratory alkalosis. There is an accumulation of the precursors of urea - ammonia, and glutamine. They include: Defect in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I - Hyperammonemia type 1 Defect in ornithine transcarbamoylase - Hyperammonemia type 2 Defect in argininosuccinate synthetase - Citrullinemia Defect in argininosuccinate lyase- Argininosuccinic aciduria Defect in the gene for arginase- Hyperargininemia Clinical features of urea cycle disorders are common to all and include vomiting, avoidance of high-protein foods, intermittent ataxia, irritability, lethargy, and severe mental retardation.

There is an accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate, which then enters into pyrimidine synthesis producing orotic acid and uracil and leading to orotic aciduria and high uracil in blood and urine. Since the ammonia from glutamine is not converted into urea, its level increases. Glutamate is not regenerated. Since glutamate is not available for transamination, amino acids cannot be used for gluconeogenesis. Hence, the glucose level drops in the blood. Treatment: Reducing intake of ammonia - Dietary protein, a metabolic source of ammonium, is restricted and caloric intake is provided by glucose and fat. Increasing excretion of ammonia - Addition of phenylbutyrate, which scavenges nitrogen by combining with amino acids to form a more water-soluble product. This can be easily excreted by the kidneys.",

The configuration of groups in a trans fatty acid is such that the acyl chains are on the opposite side of the double bond. They are formed during the hydrogenation of vegetable oils and in the production of margarine. Trans fatty acids raise the level of triglycerides, total and LDL cholesterol and also lower the level of HDL. Hence their consumption is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

Therefore (N-1) cycles of beta-oxidation will produce (N-1) FADH2 and (N-1) NADH.

        "correct_option": "a",
        "explanation": "2, 3 and 4 statements correctly explain the reason behind increased ketogenesis as seen in type1 DM. Type 1 DM is characterized by a deficiency in insulin production. Since insulin is deficient, GLUT4 (insulin-dependent uptake) mediated glucose uptake is not possible in the heart or skeletal muscles. So adipose tissue mobilizes fat to be used as an energy source. These FFA (free fatty acids) are oxidized to acetoacetyl CoA which serves as a precursor for ketone body synthesis. As the level of serum FFA is raised, proportionately more of the acetyl-CoA produced from their breakdown is converted to ketone bodies and less is oxidized via the citric acid cycle to CO2. A fall in the concentration of oxaloacetate, particularly within the mitochondria, can impair the ability of the citric acid cycle to metabolize acetyl-CoA and divert fatty acid oxidation toward ketogenesis. Such a fall may occur because of an increase in the (NADH)/(NAD+) ratio caused when increased -oxidation alters the equilibrium between oxaloacetate and malate so that the concentration of oxaloacetate is decreased. Beta-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase is one of the enzymes used in ketone body synthesis. Increased rate of ketone body synthesis in insulin-deficient state implies an increased activity of beta-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase enzyme. Biosynthesis of fatty acids and Eicosanoids",

It is formed from acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase. During fatty acid synthesis, acetyl CoA primarily acts as the primer. The enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) adds two carbons from malonyl-CoA to the inital acetyl-CoA, forming a 4-carbon intermediate (butyryl-ACP). FAS then sequentially adds two carbons from malonyl-CoA to the ACP-intermediates (eg: butyryl-ACP) to elongate the fatty acid chain. Thus, in the end product palmitic acid (C16), only carbon atoms 15 and 16 are from acetyl CoA. The remaining 14 carbon atoms are derived from malonyl-CoA. Thus, malonyl-CoA is the most active donor of two carbon atoms in fatty acid synthesis. Note: Option 3: Fatty acid synthesis is not a simple reversal of oxidation of fatty acids. These two processes involve completely different enzymes and occur in different compartments of the cell.

The above graph is called the 'Lineweaver-Burk plot' or 'double reciprocal' plot. 1/v0 (v0 - initial velocity) is plotted versus 1/[S] ([S] - substrate concentration) and a straight line is obtained. This plot can be used to calculate Km and Vmax as well as to determine the mechanism of action of enzyme inhibitors. The x-intercept represents -1/Km while the y-intercept represents 1/Vmax. In non-competitive inhibition, Vmax decreases (or 1/Vmax increases) but Km is unchanged. Hence the graphs of inhibited and uninhibited reactions have the same x-intercepts (converge at the same -1/Km) but different y-intercepts. Note: An allosteric inhibitor alters the conformation of an enzyme upon binding. Enzymes affected by allosteric inhibitors exhibit a sigmoid, not hyperbolic, relationship between V0 and [S].",

        "explanation": "Among the given graphs, the Gibbs free energy change of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is shown by graph A (Option B). Graph B (Option A) cannot represent the Gibbs free energy of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, as the energy state of an intermediate cannot be lower than the product. A lower energy state of th intermediate implies that the enzyme-intermediate complex is stable and such a complex will usually not further form a product. During any chemical reaction, the product is formed by the breaking of substrate bonds and the conformational change of the substrate into a highly unstable transition state. This transition state is denoted by the peak of the graph. The Gibbs free energy curve of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction (with no intermediate state) is shown in the image given below: The below graph shows the normal intermediate formation with an energy state still higher than that of the product: All the reactions have a transition state, but not all reactions have an intermediate state. Every intermediate state is again always followed by another transition state. Activation energy is the energy difference between the free energy of the substrates and that of the transition state. Because of the high activation energy, the rates of uncatalyzed chemical reactions are often slow. In an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the activation energy is reduced by forming a relatively stable intermediate-enzyme complex. Enzymes provide attachment sites for the substrate and speed up the rate of reaction. They don't change the energy state of either the substrate or the product. The Gibbs free energy change remains the same. Graph C: Free energy change cannot be a straight line. Every reaction passes through a high-energy intermediate transition state. Graph D: The activation energy of any reaction is never lower than the free energy of the product.",

        "explanation": "The highest catalytic efficiency is seen when Km= 2 micromole and Kcat = 200 per sec. Catalytic efficiency is calculated as Kcat/Km, where Km is inversely proportional to the binding affinity of the enzyme and Kcat is the catalytic constant (Vmax divided by the total number of active sites of the enzyme present). Higher values of Kcat and lower values of Km gives better catalytic efficiency. Catalytic efficiency can be used to compare the performance of 2 different enzymes in catalyzing a reaction. Step 1: Km of each option after converting respective units to moles will be 10, 2, 2 and 4 (each multiplied by 10-6) moles. Step 2: The catalytic efficiency is calculated as Kcat/Km. On substituting the values in various options after converting to moles, the values come out to be 2, 25, 100 and 50 (each multiplied by 106) M-1 s-1. Some enzymes can be so efficient that they convert the substrate to product instantaneously. They are limited only by the rate at which substrate diffuses towards the enzyme in a solution. These are called diffusion-limited enzymes and their catalytic efficiency is as high as 108 M-1 s-1. Fat soluble vitamins",

Pellagra presents with 4 Ds: Diarrhea, Dermatitis, Dementia, and if untreated, Death. Early symptoms of pellagra are loss of appetite, generalized weakness and irritability, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Photosensitive dermatitis is seen over sun-exposed areas. Diarrhea occurs due to proctitis or malabsorption. Bright red glossitis (beefy tongue) and Casal’s necklace (a pigmented, scaly skin rash that forms a ring around the neck) follow. Depressive psychosis and dementia also commonly occur. Corn/ maize/ jowar based diets are the main causes of niacin deficiency. Corn/maize lacks niacin and tryptophan. The excess leucine in jowar and maize disrupts the conversion of tryptophan to niacin. Niacin deficiency is also seen in alcoholism. Hence, additional histories of diarrhea and memory loss will aid in supporting the diagnosis of pellagra (along with dietary history).

Vitamin B12 is absorbed from the distal third of the ileum via receptors known as cubulin, which binds the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex. Dietary vitamin B12 is normally bound to proteins in food. Pepsin and gastric acid in the stomach degrade these food proteins and release vitamin B12. The free vitamin B12 then binds to a salivary glycoprotein called haptocorrin (R-binder). In the alkaline pH of the duodenum, pancreatic proteases degrade the haptocorrin, and vitamin B12 is released again. It then binds tightly to intrinsic factor (IF), a glycoprotein secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach and this binding takes place in the duodenum. The IF-Vitamin B12 complex reaches the terminal ileum and attaches to a receptor on the enterocyte, from where it is absorbed. Vitamin B12 is transported in the blood bound to a carrier protein called transcobalamin II and delivered to the peripheral tissues. Absorption sites: Iron- Duodenum Folate- Jejunum Vit B12- Ileum",

The only way to make further use of 5-methyl-THF and to maintain the folate cycle is by the vitamin B12-dependent remethylation of homocysteine to methionine by methionine synthase enzyme.

In vitamin B12 deficiency, defective methionine synthase leads to the following: In the absence of methionine, there is decreased methylation in the CNS.

The final diagnosis of XP can be confirmed by special laboratory tests by examining the DNA damage repair in cells from cultures exposed to ultraviolet radiation. The most common tests are skin biopsy and culture of skin fibroblasts. There is no cure for XP. Treatment consists of minimizing exposure to sunlight and regular dermatological care, as well as surgery for recurrent tumors excision. Patients should be followed up every 3 months.

As a result, the repressor cannot bind to the operator and transcription of the structural genes occurs. This is an example of negative regulation. This can only occur when glucose is absent. In the absence of glucose, adenylyl cyclase is active. This generates sufficient quantities of cAMP which bind to catabolite activator protein (CAP).The cAMP–CAP trans-acting complex binds to the CAP-binding site, another regulatory region present upstream of the structural genes of the operon.

        "explanation": "The lac operon is induced only when cyclic AMP and lactose levels are both high within the cell. When lactose is present in abundance, a small amount of lactose is converted to allolactose. This compound binds to the repressor protein of the lac operon and creates a conformational change. As a result, the repressor cannot bind to the operator and transcription of the structural genes occurs. This is an example of negative regulation. This can only occur when glucose is absent. In the absence of glucose, adenylyl cyclase is active. This generates sufficient quantities of cAMP which bind to catabolite activator protein (CAP).The cAMP–CAP trans-acting complex binds to the CAP-binding site, another regulatory region present upstream of the structural genes of the operon. This causes RNA polymerase to more efficiently initiate transcription at the promoter site. This is an example of positive regulation.",

Epigenetic changes include alterations of chromatin structure by: Methylation of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides Modification of histones by acetylation or methylation Changes in higher-order chromosome structure Sumoylation of histones (SUMO - Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier) is associated with transcription repression. Other possible roles of posttranslationally modified histones: Acetylation of core histones is associated with chromosomal assembly during DNA replication. Phosphorylation of histone H1 is associated with the condensation of chromosomes during the replication cycle. ADP-ribosylation of histones is associated with DNA repair. Methylation of histones is correlated with activation and repression of gene transcription. Acetylation of histones H3 and H4 is associated with the activation or inactivation of gene transcription.

The exact area of hybridization is localized by layering photographic emulsion over the slide and after exposure, lining up the grains with some histologic identification of the chromosome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) utilizes fluorescent probes, not radioactive probes. Fluorescent probes have greater safety, stability, and ease of detection (Option C).",

RFLPs result from single-base changes (e.g., sickle-cell disease) or from deletions or insertions (CNVs) of DNA into a restriction fragment (eg, the thalassemias) and have proved to be useful diagnostic tools. SNPs(single nucleotide polymorphisms)/RFLPs can be used to establish linkage groups, which in turn, by the process of chromosome walking, will eventually define the disease locus.",

Cleavage of a sample of DNA with a restriction enzyme produces a characteristic set of smaller DNA fragments.

T e wobble hypothesis states that codon-anticodon pairing follows the traditional Watson–Crick rules (G pairs with C and A pairs with U) for the first two bases of the codon but can be less stringent for the third/last base. It has been observed that a tRNA can recognize more than one codon for a specific amino acid, especially in the last nucleotide of the codon triplet. This is referred to as degeneracy and its mechanism can be explained by the wobble hypothesis. T e first base of the anticodon moves to permit nontraditional pairing with the last base of the codon. This movement is called wobble and is possible because the first base of the anticodon is not as spatially defined as the other two bases. Due to the wobbling, 6‰ tRNA species are not required to read the 6‰ codons. For example, three codons for glycine—GGU, GGC, and GGA—can form a base pair from one anticodon, 3 CCI 5 ie, I, inosine, can base pair with U, C, and A, as shown in the diagram below. Other options: Option A: The genetic code is universal because it is the same for all living organisms. Option B: The genetic code is unambiguous because each codon is specific for only one amino acid. Example: GGA only codes for Glycine. Option D: The genetic code is non-punctuated. This means that once the reading commences at a specific start codon, it is continuous and is read continuously as triplets until a stop codon is reached without stopping.",
