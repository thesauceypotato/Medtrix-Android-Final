Generally, movements occur in the limb only at the joints. If one is able to elicit mobility at locations other than the joints (say in the middle of the arm), it is a definite sign of a fracture. Crepitus may be felt while doing this. Other features of a fracture include: Pain Bruising Swelling Deformity These can be due to a soft-tissue injury or dislocation as well. Clinically, eliciting abnormal movement or crepitus inflicts more pain. Hence it is no longer recommended.",

They include: Greenstick fractures: The outer cortex breaks and the inner cortex bends causing the bone to buckle like the snapping of a green twig. It is seen in the pediatric population. Compression fractures: Cancellous bone crumple due to force. This is typically seen in vertebra bodies, calcaneum, and the tibial plateau.",

Pathological fractures are fractures that occur in a weakened bone that has structurally changed due to some condition. They occur either spontaneously or due to minor trauma. In Gaucher's disease, there is a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. This leads to an accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the bone tissue, weakening the bone and causing fractures. Osteogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal dominant disorder that occurs most commonly due to mutation in the COL1A and COL2A genes. This results in the abnormal formation of type 1 collagen. Since type 1 collagen is mainly present in the bone, the patient presents with repeated fractures with no or minimal trauma. Hyperparathyroidism can cause severe bone resorption leading to bone pains and pathological fracture. Overall, osteoporosis is the most common reason for pathological fractures. Below the age of 20, the common causes of pathological fracture are benign bone tumors and cysts.",

Common sites for stress fractures include: Metatarsals (especially the second, march fracture) Calcaneum Navicular Distal shaft of the fibula (runner’s fracture) Tibial shaft Patella Femoral neck MRI is the investigation of choice to diagnose stress fractures. It can visualize lower-grade stress injuries before X-ray changes appear. A bone scan is the investigation of choice when multiple sites have stress fractures.

Reduction of the fracture is done to ensure normal alignment and adequate apposition of the bone fragments.

Closed reduction of fracture relies on indirect fragment alignment utilizing the pull of the soft tissue envelope (ligaments and capsules), which is known as ligamentotaxis. Open reduction: Operative reduction of the fracture under direct vision. Option A and C: Callotaxis is callus distraction or distraction osteogenesis.

Distraction osteogenesis (distraction histogenesis) is the mechanical induction of new bone that occurs between bony surfaces that are gradually pulled apart. This is described as the tension stress effect. The most important application of the tension-stress principle is known as callus distraction (or callotaxis). A careful fracture of the bone is performed, followed by a short wait. The young callus formed is gradually distracted using a circular or unilateral external fixator. This is used in limb lengthening or for the filling of large segmental defects in the bone. Distraction or compression is carried out at the rate of 1 mm per day. This is done in four sittings - 0.25 mm, four times a day. It is also used in the following scenarios: Non-union Deformity correction Osteomyelitis - as it offers the possibility of liberal excision of bone Arthrodesis - crushing articular surfaces can stimulate union between opposing bones An illustration of distraction osteogenesis using the Ilizarov apparatus and the radiograph depicts the procedure is given below:",

Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency caused by increased pressure within a fascial compartment, leading to tissue ischemia. It is characterized by rapid progression of pain and swelling in an extremity, commonly precipitated by traumatic injury. The classic features of ischemia in acute compartment syndrome include the 5 P's: Pain - It is the first symptom of acute compartment syndrome. Ischemic muscle is highly sensitive to touch. On passive stretching of the muscles, severe pain can be elicited. Paresthesia - It is the first sign of nerve ischemia. Pallor - It may not be seen always. The skin outside the compartment may be normally perfused, as only the intra-compartmental perfusion may be affected. Paralysis - Paralysis of muscle groups affected in that compartment is a late sign. Pulselessness - Usually, the peripheral pulses and capillary return are intact in the early stages, unless there is a major arterial injury. If pulses are absent, arteriography is indicated. The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring the intra-compartmental pressure using a split catheter introduced into the compartment. The difference between diastolic pressure and compartment pressure is known as differential pressure (P). A differential pressure (P) of less than 30 mm Hg (4.00 kilopascals) is an indication for immediate compartment decompression by performing a fasciotomy.",

This results in hypoperfusion and myonecrosis in the crushed limb. When the limb is released from the compression, toxic metabolites get released to cause reperfusion injury. Crush syndrome can result in a systemic reaction due to tissue necrosis. Free myoglobin can lead to acute tubular necrosis and renal failure. Myonecrosis can lead to metabolic acidosis with hyperkalaemia and hypocalcaemia. The procoagulants escaped into the systemic circulation can produce systemic coagulopathy.

Reperfusion results in an inflammatory response in the ischemic tissue, which is probably triggered by muscle breakdown products. These activate the intrinsic clotting system resulting in microvascular thrombosis. When a large amount of muscle is ischemic, there can be a systemic inflammatory response and systemic coagulopathy.

Since the nutrient artery enters the scaphoid near its distal end, proximal fractures are associated with avascular necrosis and non-union. The more proximal the fracture in the scaphoid, the higher the chances of avascular necrosis and non-union. Certain bones have a relatively limited or watershed blood supply that can potentially get interrupted by fracture. These include: Head of the femur: after fracture of the neck or posterior dislocation of the hip. Proximal scaphoid: due to fracture through the waist of the scaphoid. Lunate: following a dislocation. Body of talus: after fracture of its neck. Fractures in these sites have a higher risk for non-union or development of osteonecrosis. Other options: Option B: Inter-trochanteric fractures involve either the greater or lesser trochanters or both, more common in the elderly following a history of a fall. Malunion is the most frequent complication. The vast metaphyseal region has an abundant blood supply, contributing to a higher union rate and fewer chances of avascular necrosis. Option C: Distal radius fractures occur by fall on an outstretched hand and they include Colles' fracture (most common), Smith's fracture, Barton's fracture, and Chauffer's fracture. The complications include joint stiffness, malunion (more common), carpal tunnel syndrome, subluxation of the inferior radio-ulnar joint, Sudeck's dystrophy, and rupture of the extensor pollicis longus tendon. Avascular necrosis or non-union is rare. Option D: Olecranon fracture results from a direct injury as in a fall onto the point of the elbow.

Basilar invagination is invagination (infolding) of the base of the skull that occurs when the top of the C2 vertebra migrates upward. It can cause narrowing of the foramen magnum (the opening in the skull where the spinal cord passes through to the brain). It also may press on the lower brainstem. Basilar impression can be primary (congenital) or secondary (acquired). Primary: Congenital defect in bone development at the craniocervical junction. The tip of the dontoid bone is more cranial than normal. Secondary: Acquired deformity due to systemic diseases that affect bony structures at the base of the skull. Neurologic symptoms are seen due to pressure on the brainstem such as weakness and paresthesia in the limbs. There can be symptoms related to compression of cranial nerves (trigeminal, vagus, glossopharyngeal, hypoglossal) and the vertebral artery. Craniometric parameters used for diagnosis include McRae’s line, Chamberlain’s line, and McGregor’s line. Treatment is by surgical decompression and stabilization with a posterior occipito-cervical arthrodesis. Odontoidectomy is done if compression is due to aberrant odontoid.

Allen's test is mainly used to test the adequacy of ulnar collateral blood flow to the hand, which is usually done prior to radial artery cannulation. Procedure: The radial and ulnar arteries are occluded as the patient makes a tight fist so as to exsanguinate the palm. Then the patient is asked to open the hand and the occlusion over the ulnar artery is released. Interpretation: As occlusion of the ulnar artery is released, the color of the open palm is observed. Normally, the color will return to the palm within 5 – 6 seconds. If the palm remains pale for more than 6-10 seconds, it indicates reduced ulnar collateral flow. The modified Allen’s test considers a threshold of 5 to 15 seconds. Clinical significance: In recent years, studies have shown that, although the Allen test is often used to identify patients at increased risk for ischemic complications from radial artery cannulation, the predictive value of this test is poor. It is also used for identifying patients acceptable for radial artery harvest or use for coronary angiography.",

Pulled elbow or nursemaid's elbow refers to the dislocation of the radial head over the annular ligament, commonly seen in children under the age of 6 years. The mechanism of injury is through axial traction on the extended and pronated forearm. This happens when a child is pulled, lifted, or swung by the arm. Following the dislocation, the child holds the arm relatively immobile, with the elbow extended and the forearm pronated, and resists supination. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, though X-rays are usually obtained to exclude a fracture. To treat the condition, simple analgesia is administered, and while the child's attention is diverted, the elbow is extended and pronated to relocate the radial head with a snap. This technique is preferred over the alternative method of supination and flexion, which tends to be more painful and less successful.",

This injury usually happens when one falls on an outstretched hand. Patients present with pain, swelling, and deformity at the lower end of the radius. On examination, the disruption of the radio-ulnar joint can be elicited by pressing the lower end of the ulna. The ulna moves down and comes back like the key of a piano (piano-key sign). The aim of treatment for this fracture is to preserve supination and pronation of the forearm. In children, closed reduction is usually enough to achieve perfect reduction. However, in adults, open reduction using a k-wire fixation or compression plating is usually required. It is also important to look for ulnar nerve damage. Galeazzi's fracture can cause complications such as malunion due to displacement of the fragment. This often results in deformity and limitation in supination and pronation.",

In peri-lunate dislocation, the lunate remains in position in the lunate fossa of the distal radius but the rest of the carpals dislocate dorsally. It is frequently associated with compression of the median nerve. Prompt reduction reduces swelling and potential damage to the median nerve. The Tavernier maneuver is the most commonly used method of closed reduction. It involves locking the capitate into the distal concavity of the lunate. If the injury cannot be reduced using this method, urgent reduction in the theater should be performed. In lunate dislocation, the lunate dislocates anteriorly while the rest of the carpal bones remain in place.",

Trigger finger is caused by stenosing tenosynovitis of the flexor sheath. There is nodular or fusiform swelling on the flexor tendon that prevents it from moving along the A1 pulley. A1 pulley is an annular ligament that acts as a belt that straps the flexor tendon to the underlying phalanges. There are 5 annular ligaments in each finger namely A1. A2, A3, A4, and A5. The image given below is showing the nodule in the flexor tendon and the 5 annular ligaments of the finger. When the finger is flexed or extended, the nodular swelling passes through the A1 pulley with a snap, leading to a triggering effect. The nodule can get trapped behind the A1 pulley leading to a locking of the finger in flexion. Surgical treatment involves the release of the A1 pulley, which is thickened and fibrosed.",

Posterior hip dislocation is commonly seen following dashboard injuries and the patient presents with flexion, adduction, and internal rotation deformity of the lower limb. Radiological findings: Loss of continuity of acetabulum with the femoral head (break in Shenton's line) Upward and lateral displacement of the femoral head The femoral head appears smaller than normal The lesser trochanter is not visualized as the thigh is internally rotated Femoral head and posterior acetabular wall fractures may also be seen The image below shows posterior dislocation with disruption of Shenton's line: Treatment: An early reduction should be done as the risk of osteonecrosis and subsequent osteoarthritis increases with time. Closed reduction under sedation or general anaesthesia is done in most cases. If there is an associated femoral neck fracture, a closed reduction should not be attempted as it can lead to the displacement of the femoral neck and disrupt the blood supply to the femoral head. In closed reduction the following steps are done: The pelvis is kept in a steady position and traction is applied in line of the femur with the knee flexed at 90&deg;. The hip is then flexed maintaining the traction along with internal rotation and adduction. This is called Allis' maneuver. The below image describes this technique: Other methods of closed reduction include - Stimson's maneuver, East Baltimore lift maneuver, and Bigelow's maneuver. After reduction, the stability of the hip is tested by flexing the hip to 90&deg;, and a longitudinal and posteriorly directed force is applied. While performing this the joint is monitored in an image intensifier to look for any signs of subluxation. In case of evidence of subluxation or any significant fractures then surgical repair should be done. If there is a delay in surgical correction, skeletal traction with a distal femoral traction pin can be done. If there is damage to the acetabulum, or intervening structures between the femoral head and the acetabular surface are present - open reduction can be considered. Early complications: Sciatic nerve injury - It can be damaged in 10-20% of the cases Vascular injury - Superior gluteal artery tear can occur Concurrent femoral shaft fracture - When both occur together hip dislocation may be missed Late complications: Osteonecrosis of the femoral head Myositis ossificans Secondary osteoarthritis Recurrent instability",

As Pauwel's angle increases, the fracture line becomes more vertical and the shearing forces act on the fractured ends. Hence, at higher angles the fracture becomes unstable.",

        "explanation": "The complaints of hip pain in an overweight man with a history of long-term steroid use along with the radiological findings of subchondral cysts and positive crescent sign in the femoral head are characteristic of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis is a painful bone condition that results from diminished blood supply mainly due to trauma or non-traumatic etiologies. Alcohol, corticosteroids, immunosuppressives, and cytotoxic drugs, either singly or in combination, are the most common causes of non-traumatic osteonecrosis. The typical features are pain with movements in or near the joint, click in the joint, joint stiffness, limping gait, and deformity. Restriction of movements is also a feature of this condition. An x-ray shows reactive new bone formation, increased radiolucency in the subchondral bone, and a distorted articular surface. The crescent sign is a subchondral fracture overlying the necrotic segment of the femoral head seen on radiography. MRI is the investigation of choice in early disease. It allows the identification of AVN of the femoral head and also determines the exact stage and extent of the pathologic process. Management is based on Ficat and Arlet Classification: Other options: Option A: Tuberculosis of the hip is characterized by painful and restricted movements of the hip, especially at night. The radiographic findings are not appreciable in the early stages. Later stages show periarticular osteoporosis, hazy and irregular joint margins with a reduction in the joint space, and wandering acetabulum. Stag e Findings Management Method 1 X-ray normal, MRI +ve Conservative Bisphosphonates 2a X-ray: sclerosis, cysts, no coll apse Conservative Bisphosphonates 2b X-ray: crescent sign, no colla pse Surgical decompressi on Core decompression 3 Collapse+loss of sphericity Surgical Osteotomy 4 Advanced arthritis Reconstructive Total hip replaceme nt Option B: Fracture neck of femur is common in elderly people after a trivial fall due to osteoporosis. Examination reveals tenderness in the groin along with shortening and external rotation of the leg. Xrays show a break in Shenton’s line and trabecular stream, overriding of greater trochanter so that it lies at the level of the head of the femur, and external rotation of the femur is evident by prominent lesser trochanter. Option C: Osteochondromas are common benign bone tumors commonly present in adolescents. The lesions consist of a bony mass, often in the form of a stalk, produced by endochondral ossification of a growing cartilaginous cap. They are usually painless. The common sites of involvement are the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus.",

But in Haglund deformity, there is chronic inflammation of this retrocalcaneal bursa due to increased or repetitive chafing between the tuberosity and Achilles tendon. Due to prolonged inflammation, degenerative changes occur and osteophytes form within the tendon leading to calcification at the site of the tendon insertion. This leads to deformity and pain symptoms.

Chronic osteomyelitis may occur by direct inoculation of the infective organism during trauma (like road traffic accidents). The infection continues to thrive within the bone leading to alternating quiescent and flare-up stages of chronic osteomyelitis. Sequestrum is a piece of dead bone. It is formed when a fragment of bone gets separated from the healthy bone due to necrosis. It varies in size from a spicule to a large fragment and acts as a nidus for infection. It leads to abscess and persistent pus discharge in the bone. Sinus tracts are formed when the abscess from the infected bone drains out through the skin.

The typical radiographic finding is a circumscribed, round or oval radiolucent cavity measuring 1-2 cm in diameter, surrounded by a halo of sclerosis, with minimal or no periosteal reaction. The radioisotope scan shows markedly increased activity. MRI may be helpful in diagnosis. Open biopsy with curettage is indicated if there is any doubt in the diagnosis. Differential diagnoses include: Cystic tuberculosis Eosinophilic granuloma Osteoid osteoma Ewing's sarcoma Treatment: Immobilization and antibiotics (flucloxacillin and fusidic acid) intravenous for 4-5 days, followed by oral administration for another 6 weeks; healing may take up to 12 months Curettage is needed if the x-rays show no healing after conservative management.

        "explanation": "The given clinical scenario is suggestive of the infantile form of osteopetrosis. It is characterised by decreased osteoclastic activity due to defect in carbonic anhydrase ll proton pump. The excessive new bone formation with defective resorption leads to abnormal development of the skull, especially causing narrowing of the foramina of the skull. This leads to various complications like hydrocephalus, cranial nerve compression leading to deafness and facial palsy, sinus blockage, etc. Failure of bone resorption results in poorly formed medullary cavity. This leads to defective hematopoiesis in the medullary cavity and stimulation of extramedullary hematopoiesis. Hence, the infant presents with pancytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly. Abnormal bone density may also lead to altered vasculature causing complications like osteitis of the mandible. Excess bone density also leads to endobone appearance and rugger jersey appearance of vertebrae on radiograph. X-ray spine of a patient with osteopetrosis is given below. Renal osteodystrophy also shows rugger jersey appearance of vertebrae on x-ray. However, renal osteodystrophy is a complication of chronic kidney disease and the patient is an infant. So the likely answer in the patient in the given scenario is osteopetrosis (Option B). Osteoporosis and Osteomalacia",

Alendronate and risedronate can be administered daily or weekly with different dosages. Ibandronate can be administered daily, weekly or quarterly. Zoledronate is administered annually. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody with an affinity for RANKL. RANKL stimulates osteoclast that results in bone resorption. By inhibiting the RANKL, denosumab prevents activation of osteoclast and decreases bone resorption. SERMs: Raloxifene and tamoxifen are approved for the treatment of osteoporosis.

The second phase is a period of very active bone formation and resorption. It is characterised by normal lamellar bone replaced with haphazard (woven) bone. In the final sclerotic phase, bone resorption declines progressively and leads to a hard, dense, less vascular mosaic bone, which represents the so-called burned-out phase of Paget’s disease. The arrow mark in the following image indicates blade of grass appearance.",

        "explanation": "Methotrexate with anti-TNF is superior to any other treatment in limiting progression of joint destruction and disability. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) joint inflammation is the main cause of joint damage and is the most important factor of joint disability and deformities. Methotrexate belongs to the category of drugs known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). They slow down or prevent the structural progression of RA and hence are used in most combination therapies. Among the DMARDs, methotrexate is the preferred first-line drug. Biologic DMARDs such as anti-TNF agents target cytokines and cell-surface molecules to slow the progression of joint inflammation. These drugs are typically used in combination with background methotrexate therapy. Combination therapy with methotrexate and an anti-TNF drug is the most commonly used next step for the treatment of patients with deformities, having an inadequate response to methotrexate therapy. Steroids are used when rapid control of the disease is required. They have a rapid onset of action, while the DMARDs take anywhere from 6-12 weeks to come into effect. They can be used as a cover during this period. Steroids can also be used in short courses for acute flare-up episodes of RA. Long-term use of steroids is not advised due to their adverse effects such as osteoporosis. They are usually not used alone (option A) but are used as an adjunct to DMARDs like methotrexate (option B). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used as adjunctive therapy for the management of uncontrollable symptoms because of their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Chronic use is not advised due to their side effects namely gastritis and peptic ulcer disease as well as impairment of renal function (option D) Hence, among the given options methotrexate with anti-TNF is the best therapy in a patient with deformity.",

AS is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the spine and sacroiliac joint. It is more common in young males and has a strong association with HLA-B27. Features of lower back pain in AS: Age at onset < 40 years Insidious onset Morning stiffness > 30 minutes Improvement with exercise Pain persists with rest and is also present at night. Alternating gluteal pain Persistence for more than 3 months Examination findings in AS: Loss of lumbar lordosis Increased thoracic kyphosis Diminished spinal movements Decreased chest expansion ( <7 cm) Tenderness over sacroiliac joints Important X-ray features of ankylosing spondylitis: Sacro-iliac joints: Cardinal sign/earliest sign is the erosion and fuzziness of the sacroiliac joints Later- periarticular sclerosis and bony ankylosis of the joint. Vertebral changes: Early spondylitis is characterized by small erosions at the corners of vertebral bodies with reactive sclerosis: Romanus lesions of the spine (Shiny corner sign) Squaring of vertebral bodies or flattening of the normal anterior concavity of the spine due to inflammatory resorption of the bone. Later signs are ossification of the ligaments around the intervertebral discs producing syndesmophytes (bridges) between adjacent vertebrae Bamboo spine appearance is due to bridging at several vertebral levels Linear ossification along the central spine, representing interspinous ligament ossification can give a Dagger sign appearance on frontal radiographs. CT imaging in AS helps to visualize bone erosions, osteoporosis/osteosclerosis, and new bone formation in the form of syndesmophytes, ligamentous ossification, and ankylosis. The X-ray below shows the bamboo spine appearance in AS: Nerve Injuries",

They are usually asymptomatic, but pathological fractures may occur through the cyst wall and may cause pain and swelling. The cyst may cause growth disturbances due to its proximity to the growth plate. On X-ray, a bone fracture fragment may be seen resting in a dependent portion of the cyst. This is known as the fallen fragment/fallen leaf sign and it is pathognomonic of a simple bone cyst. The trapdoor sign is a variant of the fallen leaf sign. Here, a periosteal hinge keeps the fragment from falling dependently and allows it to change position with a change in the patient's position.",

The tumor stroma is well-vascularized with bands of cellular or collagenous fibrous tissue. The image below shows the histopathology of GCT: Other options: Option A: Aneurysmal bone cyst usually occurs in the metaphysis of long bones and the posterior elements of vertebral bodies. It is characterized by multiloculated blood-filled cystic spaces separated by septae, composed of multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells and reactive woven bone. Radiographically, an aneurysmal bone cyst is seen as an eccentric, expansile, lesion with well-defined margins. Most lesions are completely lytic and often contain a thin shell of reactive bone at the periphery. Option C: Chondroblastoma is a benign cartilaginous tumor that occurs mainly in bones around the knee joint. On x-ray, the tumor appears as a well-circumscribed, round, or oval lytic lesion in the center of the epiphysis of long bones, with areas of calcification within the tumor, giving the characteristic mottled appearance. On histology presence of \"chicken wire calcification\" is pathognomic. Option D: Langerhans cell histiocytosis commonly involves the skull, pelvis, femur, and mandible. Radiographs show a lytic lesion with periosteal new bone formation. In the skull, lesions appear as a hole within a hole, and in the vertebra, vertebra plana (flattening of the vertebral body) can be seen. Histopathologically, Langerhans cells have a single large nucleus with a characteristic folded or grooved nucleus (“coffee-bean” appearance) with small inconspicuous nucleoli.

Giant cell tumor is a benign but locally aggressive tumor seen involving the metaphysis and /or the epiphysis of long bones, as seen in the image, in young adults of age 20-45 years and rarely teenagers less than 20 years. Although an aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is also a benign, locally destructive, eccentric multiloculated lytic tumor that can present with a similar radiographical picture in any age group (most commonly in adolescents), it is confined within the metaphysis of the long bones, unlike GCT, thus ruling it out in this case. On MRI a fluid sign can be seen. The following is an x-ray image of the knee showing ABC confined to the metaphysis of the long bones: An ABC is treated by extended curettage and grafting with a bone graft substitute (option B). GCT is most commonly seen in the distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus, and distal radius. It presents with complaints of swelling and vague pain and Sometimes, the patient can presents for the first time with a pathological fracture because of the lesion. Important x-ray features of a GCT: Eccentric, solitary lytic lesion In epiphysis and metaphysis Expansile- expands overlying cortex Soap bubble appearance - due to the trabeculae of the remnants of bone traversing the lytic lesion, giving it a loculated appearance. No or minimal reactive sclerosis around the tumor No calcification Histologically, GCTs consist of undifferentiated spindle cells profusely interspersed with multi-nucleated giant cells. The tumor stroma is well-vascularized with bands of cellular or collagenous fibrous tissue. The treatment of choice for GCT is by Extended curettage and bone grafting (Option A). GCT in the relatively insignificant bone like the distal ulna, clavicle, and proximal fibula is treated by resection without reconstruction. Bisphosphonates have been shown to reduce the proliferation of osteoclasts and hence have been shown to stabilize local and metastatic disease. Radiotherapy can be used for vertebral tumors Additional supportive therapy such as cryotherapy, when used reduce the reccurence rate.",

The clinical vignette of a 12-year-old boy presenting with fever, swelling over the right leg, an elevated leukocyte count, ESR and CRP, MIC-2 staining being positive and the X-ray showing onion skin appearance are all suggestive of Ewing's sarcoma. It is a highly malignant tumour that frequently affects males between 10 and 20 years of age. It usually affects the diaphysis of long bones like the femur and tibia. The femur is the most commonly affected, followed by the tibia, humerus and fibula, but overall the pelvis accounts for the majority of cases. Pain is the earliest symptom, followed by swelling and a low-grade fever. Serologically, the ESR and WCC may be elevated and haemoglobin may be reduced. An x-ray shows an aggressive, poorly defined osteolytic lesion with cortical destruction and periosteal reaction. A distinct ‘onion-skin’ appearance is observed due to the destruction of the cortex and new bone formation in layers. Histologically, Ewing’s sarcoma is composed of primitive, undifferentiated, small, round blue cells with large nuclei and scant cytoplasm that bears no resemblance to normal tissue. The characteristic translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 results in a fusion gene, EWSR1-FL11, which is present in 90% of cases. The presence of the translocation may be supported by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Immunohistochemical staining for MIC-2 is specific for Ewing’s sarcoma. The most common sites of metastasis include lungs, bones and lymph nodes. Bone marrow involvement is a unique feature of Ewing’s sarcoma. Preoperative chemotherapy with vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide results in extensive tumour necrosis and shrinkage. Wide excision may be combined with adjuvant radiotherapy if surgical margins are poor. Definitive radiotherapy rather than surgical excision may be advocated if it is non-resectable or metastasis has occurred. It is a radio-sensitive tumour. Indicators of a favourable prognosis include younger age, involvement of distal appendicular sites, small tumour volume, normal ESR and greater chemotherapy response.",

        "explanation": "The above radiograph depicts the lengthening of the limb using Ilizarov apparatus. The rate of compression/distraction is 1 mm per day, not 2 mm per day. Ilizarov's technique is based on the principle of distraction osteogenesis. This is the mechanical induction of new bone which occurs between bony surfaces that are gradually pulled apart. Compression and distraction at the fracture site enhance osteogenesis. A careful fracture of the bone is performed, followed by a short wait. The young callus formed is gradually distracted using a circular or unilateral external fixator system called a ring fixator. Transfixing thin Kirschner wires (K-wires) are the key components of the Ilizarov fixator regarding its axial stiffness. This affects the mechanobiological environment in which the bone heals. Distraction or compression can be applied by twisting nuts on the fixation system at the fracture or corticotomy site. Distraction or compression is carried out at the rate of 1 mm per day. The uses of Ilizarov's apparatus are as follows: Limb lengthening Non-union Deformity correction Osteomyelitis - as it offers the possibility of liberal excision of bone Arthrodesis - crushing articular surfaces can stimulate union between opposing bones Disadvantages of this technique include pin tract infection, nerve palsy, and joint stiffness. The below images show the Ilizarov apparatus and an illustration of distraction osteogenesis.",

An example of open degloving injury is finger avulsion injury with loss of skin. Closed degloving injuries result from shearing forces (e.g. motor vehicle collisions). The extent of degloving injuries are often underappreciated and much of the skin may be non-viable. Disruption of perforating vascular and lymphatic vessels may result in a characteristic haemolymphatic collection between the fascial planes called a Morel-Lavallée lesion. Patterns of degloving injury: Limited degloving with abrasion or avulsion Non-circumferential degloving Circumferential single plane degloving Circumferential multiplanar degloving Assessing the viability of degloved tissue can be difficult and may therefore require more than one surgical exploration and debridement before definitive reconstruction. Non-viable skin may show fixed staining and thrombosis of subcutaneous veins. Most surgeons serially excise the degloved skin until punctate dermal bleeding is seen from viable tissue. Intravenous fluorescein can help in delineating non-viable tissue, but it requires specialist equipment and there is a small risk of anaphylaxis. Indocyanine green has been found to have less risk of allergy. Open degloving injuries are managed by reattaching the viable skin and grafting. Closed degloving injuries are managed by draining the accumulated fluid, removing the dead tissue and sclerotherapy. For severe, multiplanar degloving, amputation is done.

In Thompson's test, the patient lies prone with his foot over the end of the examination table. The examiner squeezes the calf muscles, specifically the gastrocnemius-soleus complex, with his hand. This should normally cause contraction of the Achilles tendon, resulting in plantar flexion. If the Achilles tendon is completely ruptured, plantar flexion would be absent. Achilles tendinitis is usually seen in athletes, joggers, and hikers. It is caused due to the local irritation of the tendon sheath. Patients present with gradually progressive pain over the Achilles tendon. On examination, there may be thickening of the tendon with inflammation over the affected area. Ultrasound may be needed to exclude tendon tear or rupture. It is usually treated by physiotherapy.",
