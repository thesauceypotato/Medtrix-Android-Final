Unlike necrosis, the process is regulated by specific signals and can, therefore, be prevented by reducing iron levels. Ferroptosis has been linked to cell death in a variety of human pathologies including: Cancer Neurodegenerative diseases Stroke Other forms of cell death that are not dependent on lipid peroxidation include: Necroptosis or programmed necrosis - programmed cell death without caspase activation Pyroptosis - programmed cell death that is dependent on caspases 1, 4, and 5",

During normal protein synthesis, chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) control the proper folding of newly synthesized proteins. Misfolded polypeptides are ubiquitinated and targeted for proteolysis. Sometimes, unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER as a result of inherited mutations or environmental stress. This induces a protective response called the unfolded protein response that increases the production of chaperones. This reduces the levels of misfolded proteins in the cell. However, when the accumulation of misfolded proteins overwhelms these adaptations, it results in ER stress which leads to the activation of caspases and, ultimately, apoptosis. Some diseases that occur due to the accumulation of abnormal folded proteins are: Alzheimer's disease Huntington's disease Parkinson's disease Prion diseases Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Tay-Sachs disease Intracellular Accumulations, Pathological Calcification and Cellular Ageing",

During inflammation, stasis leads to slow blood flow and reduced wall shear stress. This further pushes the WBCs towards a peripheral position along the endothelial surface. This is called margination. Subsequently, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium, then detach and bind again. This is referred to as rolling on the vessel wall.

They also contain a high concentration of antimicrobial proteins like neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and histones that have a high affinity for DNA. They are produced by neutrophils in response to the following triggers: Pathogens - Mainly bacteria and fungi Inflammatory mediators - Chemokines Cytokines (mainly interferons) Complement proteins Reactive oxygen species NETs have also been detected in the blood during sepsis. In this condition, platelet activation is involved in NET formation The nuclear chromatin in the NETs is a source of nuclear antigens (histones and associated DNA) in systemic autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Exudative effusions are protein-rich and often cloudy due to the presence of WBCs. Subcutaneous edema has the following features: Dependent edema - dependent areas (towards gravity) have high hydrostatic pressures i.e., in the legs when standing and the sacrum when recumbent Pitting edema - finger pressure over markedly edematous subcutaneous tissue displaces the interstitial fluid and leaves a depression. Edema resulting from renal dysfunction often appears initially in parts of the body containing loose connective tissue, such as the eyelids.

        "explanation": "A non-sense mutation is seen in  0 thalassemia. A point mutation is a change in which a single base is substituted with a different base. The point mutations within the coding sequences of the DNA are of two types: Missense mutations: These involve alteration of a single base in a triplet of bases. It leads to the replacement of one amino acid by another in the gene product. These mutations alter the meaning of the sequence of the encoded protein. Based on the substituted amino acid coded, the missense mutations are again of two types: Conservative missense mutation: The substituted amino acid is biochemically similar to the original. It typically causes little change in the function of the protein. Non-conservative missense mutation: This type of mutation replaces the normal amino acid with a biochemically different one. Nonsense mutations: It is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon. For example, a point mutation affecting the codon for glutamine (CAG) creates a stop codon (UAG) if U is substituted for C. This change leads to premature termination of  -globin gene translation, and the short peptide that is produced is rapidly degraded. The resulting deficiency of  -globin chains can give rise to a severe form of anemia called  0 thalassemia. Option B: -thalassemias are caused by inherited deletions that result in the reduced or absent synthesis of -globin chains. Option C: Sickle-cell anemia is an example of non-conservative missense mutation. It occurs due to the replacement of the 6th glutamic acid by valine in the beta-globin gene on chromosome 11. Option D: Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is an inherited disorder caused by intrinsic defects in the red cell membrane skeleton that render red cells spheroid less deformable and vulnerable to splenic sequestration and destruction.",

Thereby resulting in an offspring with a phenotype that is neither dominant nor recessive and both the alleles of a gene pair contributes to the phenotype. Mendelian traits are usually described as dominant or recessive: A dominant allele produces a dominant phenotype in individuals who have one copy of the allele, which can come from just one parent. A recessive allele produces a recessive phenotype, in individuals who have two copies of the allele, one from each parent. The illustration below shows the codominant inheritance pattern of the blood group. Hair colour, height, and skin color are polygenic traits.",

This leads to splenic fibrosis, organ infarcts, and bone changes. The numerous differing end-organ derangements are all related to the primary defect in hemoglobin synthesis. Option B: In variable expressivity, a trait is seen in all individuals carrying the mutant gene but is expressed differently among them. Option C: Polymorphisms are caused by interactions between multiple variant forms of genes and environmental factors. Option D: Genetic heterogeneity refers to mutations at several genetic loci that may produce the same trait.

After causing the cleavage of the aortic layers for a considerable length, sometimes extending to the root of the aorta or down to the iliac arteries, the hemorrhage often ruptures through the aortic wall. Although mitral valve lesions are more frequent, they are clinically less important than aortic lesions. Loss of connective tissue support in the mitral valve leaflets makes them soft and billowy, creating a so-called floppy valve. Valvular lesions, along with the lengthening of the chordae tendineae, frequently give rise to mitral regurgitation. Similar changes may affect the tricuspid and, rarely, the aortic valves.",

Ring chromosomes behave abnormally in meiosis or mitosis and usually result in serious consequences. In rare cases, the telomeres at the ends of a chromosome fuse without any loss of genetic material, which results in a normal phenotype. A ring chromosome is denoted by the symbol r in human genetics. The following image shows a representative karyotype from a well-differentiated transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. The chromosome indicated by 'r' represents a ring chromosome. Also evident are monosomy 9, 18, and X and trisomy 7. Option A: In a translocation, a segment of one chromosome is transferred to another. Option C: Inversion refers to a rearrangement that involves two breaks within a single chromosome, with reincorporation of the inverted, intervening segment. Option D: Isochromosome formation results when one arm of a chromosome is lost and the remaining arm is duplicated. It results in a chromosome consisting of two short arms only or of two long arms.",

However, children born to an affected father and a normal mother do not inherit the disease. Hence, only the daughters of the affected mother will transmit the disease. This is because this condition is due to a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is derived from the maternal mitochondria. The ovum contains several mitochondria, while the spermatozoa have very few mitochondria if present. Hence, the mitochondrial DNA of the zygote is entirely derived from the ovum. LHON is a neurodegenerative disease that manifests as progressive bilateral loss of central vision. Visual impairment starts between ages 15 and 35, leading eventually to blindness.

GNAS mutation causes pituitary adenoma and other endocrine tumors. The 3 RAS genes in humans (H-RAS, K-RAS, and N-RAS) are the most common oncogenes in human cancer. They code for a family of proteins called GTP-binding (G) proteins, which are involved in transmitting signals within cells (cellular signal transduction). When RAS is 'switched on' by incoming signals, it subsequently switches on other proteins, which ultimately results in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in RAS genes can lead to the production of permanently activated RAS proteins. As a result, this can cause unintended and overactive signaling inside the cell, even in the absence of incoming signals. Because these signals result in cell growth and division, overactive RAS signaling can ultimately lead to cancer.",

Two mutations (hits), involving both alleles of RB at chromosome locus 13q14, are required to produce retinoblastoma. In familial cases, children inherit one defective copy of the RB gene in the germline (the first hit), and the other copy is normal. Retinoblastoma develops when the normal RB allele is mutated in retinoblasts as a result of a spontaneous somatic mutation (the second hit). Most individuals inheriting a germline defect in one RB allele develop unilateral or bilateral retinoblastoma as it is an autosomal dominant disease. Sporadic cases are comparitively rare.

        "explanation": "Anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab was the first drug to achieve a significant improvement in survival of advanced-stage melanoma. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) plays an important inhibitory role in the control of T-cell activation. Ipilimumab is a fully-humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4). It has been postulated that anti-CTLA-4 antibodies act by blocking inhibitory signals from effector T-cells, allowing costimulatory signaling and generation of antitumor T-cell responses. In vitro studies demonstrated also that the antitumor activity of CTLA-4 blockade is mediated by Fc gamma receptor-expressing macrophage and hypothesized a possible role of regulatory T-cell depletion in the tumor microenvironment. Option B - Mutation of tumor supressor genes is associated with increased risk of cancer. Antigen toxicity is when the immune response to an antigen is excessive or misdirected, causing damage to tissues or organs. Option C - PD1/PDL1 is an immune checkpoint whose activation inhibits T-cell function and helps with immune tolerance. Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction using immune checkpoint inhibitors reactivates T cells and enhances immune responses against tumors. Option D - CD28 is primarily involved in providing the second signal required for T ce activation. The first signal comes from the interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) and the antigen presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Without CD28-mediated costimulation, T cells that only receive the TCR signal (without the second signal) can become anergic. Carcinogenesis, Paraneoplastic Syndromes and Tumor Markers",

        "explanation": "NRG-1 (Neuregulin-1) is not a marker for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). GIST are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the abdomen, the stomach being the most common site. They arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal, the pacemaker cells of the GIT. GIST is seen in the 5th to 6th decade of life and has an equal preponderance among males and females. Most patients present with haematemesis, melena, or vague abdominal pain. The most common indications for surgery include bleeding and obstruction. The GIST may occur in a sporadic form or as part of familial syndromes. In sporadic GIST, the most common mutations seen are gain-of-function mutation in KIT (75-80%) and PDGFRA mutation (8%). Microscopically, GIST has elongated spindle cells or plumper epithelioid cells, or a mixed pattern. The below image shows the microscopy of GIST composed of bundles, or fascicles, of spindle-shaped tumor cells. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient GIST is a subset of wild-type GIST seen with Carney triad or Carney-Stratakis syndrome. Imatinib can be used to treat GIST with mutations in KIT or PDGFRA. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) - deficient GIST is imatinib-resistant, so sunitinib, sorafenib, or regorafenib can be used instead. During surgical resection of GIST, care must be taken to prevent capsule rupture, which causes seeding of nearby tissues leading to relapse in 100% of the cases. If capsule rupture occurs, adjuvant therapy with imatinib is indicated regardless of tumor extent. Other options: Option A: KIT (CD117): This is the most well-known marker for GISTs. About 85% of GISTs show mutations in the KIT gene, leading to the expression of the KIT protein on the cell surface. KIT is a receptor tyrosine kinase, and its activation is a key driver in the pathogenesis of GISTs. Option B: SDH (Succinate Dehydrogenase): SDH mutations are associated with a subset of GISTs, particularly those that are KIT and PDGFRA wild-type. Loss of SDH function is characteristic of this subgroup, and SDH deficiency can be demonstrated through immunohistochemistry. Option C: PDGFRA (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha): Mutations in the PDGFRA gene account for approximately 5-10% of GISTs. Similar to KIT, PDGFRA is a receptor tyrosine kinase, and mutations in this gene can lead to the development of GISTs. Components of Immune System",

NK cells can lyse IgG-coated target cells by binding to the Fc tail of IgG, through the CD16 receptor expressed on NK cells. This phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). NK cells secrete various cytokines such as interferon- (IFN-), which activate macrophages to destroy ingested microbes. Target cell destruction by NK cells is also mediated through two others receptors - activating receptors and inhibitory receptors. The activating receptors enable NK cells to recognize infected and stressed cells. The inhibitory receptors recognize self class-I MHC molecules, that are expressed on all healthy cells thereby preventing NK cells from killing normal cells. Virus infection / neoplastic transformation overexpresses the activating receptors and simultaneously reduces the expression of class-I MHC molecules. As a result, NK cells are activated and the infected cells are killed. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes directly kill damaged cells.

This promotes the expansion of antigen-stimulated T cells and their differentiation into effector and memory cells. T-cell activation requires two signals that are delivered by APCs. They include: Antigens displayed by APCs in the form of peptides bound to MHC molecules, that are recognised by T-cell receptors Costimulatory signal (as it stimulates T cells in conjunction with antigen) provided by molecules on APCs that engage particular costimulatory receptors on T cells In the absence of costimulation, T cells that recognize antigen either fail to respond and die or enter a state of unresponsiveness known as anergy. Thus, costimulation is a key determinant of the outcome of a T-cell encounter with an antigen.",

They are induced by environmental antigens (allergens) that stimulate strong TH2 responses and IgE production in genetically susceptible individuals. IgE coats mast cells by binding to Fcg receptors. Reexposure to the allergen leads to cross-linking of the IgE and FcRI, activation of mast cells, and release of mediators. The principal mediators are histamine, proteases, and other granule contents like prostaglandins and leukotrienes and cytokines. It occurs in two phases: immediate phase and late phase. The mediators are responsible for the immediate vascular and smooth muscle reactions and the late-phase reaction (inflammation). The clinical manifestations may be local or systemic and range from mildly annoying rhinitis to fatal anaphylaxis. The image given below shows the sequence of events in immediate hypersensitivity.",

The biopsy of the thymus showing remnants of Hassall's corpuscles indicates it is due to adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. SCID is a defect in both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Usually the defect lies in the T-cell compartment with secondary impairment in humoral immunity. Affected infants present with prominent thrush (oral candidiasis), extensive diaper rash, and failure to thrive. Some patients develop a morbilliform rash shortly after birth because maternal T cells are transferred across the placenta and attack the fetus, causing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Persons with SCID are extremely susceptible to recurrent, severe infections by a wide range of pathogens, including: Candida albicans Pneumocystis jiroveci Pseudomonas Cytomegalovirus Varicell There are 2 types of SCID based on inheritance: X-linked SCID is the most common form and hence it is more common in boys than in girls. The genetic defect is the mutation in the common -chain (c) subunit of cytokine receptors. T-cell numbers are greatly reduced, and although B cells may be normal in number, antibody synthesis is impaired because of the lack of T-cell help. The thymus contains lobules of undifferentiated epithelial cells resembling fetal thymus. Autosomal recessive is most commonly caused due to deficiency of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA). The deficiency of ADA leads to the accumulation of deoxyadenosine and its derivatives (e.g., deoxy-ATP). They are toxic to rapidly dividing immature lymphocytes, especially those of the T-cell lineage. Hence, there may be a greater reduction in the number of T lymphocytes. In the two most common forms (c mutation and ADA deficiency), the thymus is small and devoid of lymphoid cells. In SCID caused by ADA deficiency, remnants of Hassall’s corpuscles can be found.

This is due to CD40L-mediated macrophage activation, a key reaction of cell-mediated immunity being defective.

The ATM protein is a sensor of DNA damage (double-strand breaks), and it activates p53 by phosphorylation. Ataxia-telangiectasia is characterized by abnormal gait (ataxia), vascular malformations (telangiectases), neurologic deficits, increased incidence of tumors, and immunodeficiency. It may affect both B and T cells. There is a high incidence of lymphomas and leukemias.",

HIV-1 virion is spherical and contains an electron-dense, cone-shaped core surrounded by a lipid envelope derived from the host cell membrane. Target cells of HIV include CD4+ helper T cells (worst affected), monocyte-macrophages, and dendritic cells. The virus core contains: Major capsid protein p24 Nucleocapsid protein p7/p9 Two copies of viral genomic RNA The three viral enzymes (protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase) The viral core is surrounded by a matrix protein called p17, which lies underneath the virion envelope. The viral envelope is studded by two viral glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, which are critical for HIV infection of cells. Viral glycoprotein gp120 binds to CD4+ cells in the host. CXCR4 and CCR5 function as coreceptors for HIV-1 entry into CD4+ cells. This binding leads to a conformational change in gp41 causing exposure of a hydrophobic region called the fusion peptide at the tip of gp41. This peptide inserts into the cell membrane of the target cells (e.g., T cells or macrophages), leading to the fusion of the virus with the host cell.

Acute GVHD develops within days to weeks. There is the involvement of the immune system and epithelium of the skin, liver, and intestines. It presents with: Generalized rash Jaundice Bloody diarrhea due to mucosal ulceration Non-infectious pulmonary infiltrates (rarely), the outcome is generally poor Chronic GVHD may follow the acute syndrome or occur insidiously.

        "explanation": "In iron deficiency anaemia, there is an increase in transferrin receptor mRNA concentration and synthesis. Iron absorbed through diet or which is released from circulation is bound to transferrin (iron transfer protein). When erythropoiesis is stimulated, iron-transferrin complexes act as transferrin receptors on the surface of bone marrow erythroid cells. Through receptor-mediated endocytosis, this complex is internalised. This iron is then made available for heme synthesis while the transferrin-receptor complex is recycled to the surface of the cell, from where the transferrin is released back into circulation and the transferrin receptor re-anchors into the cell membrane. The excess iron after hemoglobin synthesis binds to apoferritin (storage protein), forming ferritin. Senescent RBCs undergo phagocytosis in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system. The hemoglobin is broken down, the globin and other proteins are returned to the amino acid pool, and the iron is shuttled back to the surface of the reticuloendothelial cell, where it is taken up by transferrin via ferroportin (iron export channel). There is no regulated excretory pathway for iron, and the only mechanisms by which iron is lost are blood loss (via gastrointestinal bleeding, menstruation, or other forms of bleeding) and the loss of epithelial cells from the skin, gut, and genitourinary tract.

It will show you if the patient is making enough reticulocytes for the degree of anemia present. As the hemoglobin drops, reticulocytes increase from the normal range of 0.5–2.0%. The standard reference range of hemoglobin concentration in females is 12-15 g/dl. Accordingly, in this scenario, corrected reticulocyte count would range between 3-3.75%. So, the best answer to this question remains option C. Absolute reticulocyte count is the percentage of red cells that are reticulocytes (normal is about 0.5 – 2.0%). However, it does not reflect the fact that as the hemoglobin drops, there should be more reticulocytes, percentage-wise (for example, at a hemoglobin of 5, you should have a much higher percentage of reticulocytes than you should at a hemoglobin of 10). To take this into account, we use corrected reticulocyte count. Reticulocyte Index = Corrected reticulocyte count / maturation factor This corrects for the longer life span of prematurely released reticulocytes in the blood which is a phenomenon of increased red blood cell production.

The decreased  chain production leads to a relative excess of  chains. This leads to the formation of HbH which has a high affinity for oxygen. Such RBCs are more prone to oxidation which causes precipitation of HbH to form golf ball inclusion bodies. This leads to increased sequestration and phagocytosis in the spleen.",

        "explanation": "Aplastic crisis in sickle cell anaemia is caused by parvovirus B19. It is a transient arrest of erythropoiesis, usually triggered by an acute parvovirus infection. Parvovirus infects and kills red cell precursors. It occurs in sickle cell disease and other hemolytic anaemias. Vaso-occlusive crises (pain crises) are episodes of hypoxic injury and infarction that cause severe pain in the affected region. The most commonly involved sites are the bones, lungs, liver, brain, pleen, and penis. Acute chest syndrome is a type of vaso-occlusive crisis involving the lungs. It typically presents with fever, cough, chest pain, and pulmonary infiltrates. Pulmonary inflammation may cause blood flow to become sluggish and “spleenlike,” leading to sickling and vaso-occlusion. Sequestration crises occur in children with intact spleens. Massive entrapment of sickle red cells leads to rapid splenic enlargement, hypovolemia, and sometimes shock. Both sequestration crises and acute chest syndrome may be fatal and sometimes require prompt treatment with exchange transfusions.",

In G6PD-deficiency, the RBCs are exposed to high levels of oxidants. This causes cross-linking of reactive sulfhydryl groups on globin chains. The globin chains become denatured and form membrane-bound precipitates known as Heinz bodies. These can be detected by supravital staining. Heinz bodies can damage the membrane sufficiently to cause intravascular hemolysis. As RBCs with Heinz bodies pass through the spleen, the macrophages pluck out the Heinz bodies. As a result, some of these partially devoured cells retain an abnormal shape i.e. as if a bite was taken out of them. Such cells are called bite cells.

The half-life of G6PD- is moderately reduced, whereas that of G6PD Mediterranean is markedly reduced; hence, the severity of deficiency is greater with the Mediterranean variant. The most common normal variant is G6PD B. The hemolysis in G6PD deficiency is both extravascular and intravascular hemolysis. The damaged red cells are sequestered in the spleen and killed by macrophages, causing extravascular hemolysis. The oxidative stresses can denature hemoglobin, resulting in intravascular hemolysis. In individuals with G6PD deficiency, acute intravascular hemolysis begins 2 to 3 days after exposure to oxidants. Only older RBCs are at risk for lysis. The hemolytic episode is self-limited because hemolysis stops when only younger G6PD-replete red cells remain, even if the patient continues to take the offending drug.",

For the first 15 minutes after the infusion has begun, the patient should be kept under close observation to detect any signs of a serious transfusion reaction.

Infusion of a unit for longer than 4 hours is not recommended, as there is a risk of bacterial proliferation because the opened unit is at room temperature. No other solution and no medication should be added to or infused through the same tubing as a blood product.

It occurs within 6 hours, and not after 2 days following transfusion. TRALI is a severe fatal complication of blood transfusion. The incidence of TRALI is low (1 per 10,000 transfusions). However, it may occur more frequently in patients with preexisting lung disease. The pathogenesis involves a two-hit hypothesis: Priming event - increased sequestration and sensitization of neutrophils in the microvasculature of the lung Second hit - the factor (most commonly MHC class I antigens) present in the transfused blood roduct activates the primed neutrophils TRALI can occur in transfusions with all plasma-containing blood products. However, it is more likely to occur following the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets. This is because these products contain high levels of donor antibodies. Note: TRALI is important to recognize because donor products that induce complications in one patient are much more likely to do so in a second. Indeed, recent measures to exclude multiparous women from plasma donation have resulted in reduced incidence of TRALI.",

This fusion gene encodes for a chimeric protein, which consists of a part of the PML protein and a part of the retinoic acid receptor- (RAR). The normal RAR binds to the D•A and activates the transcription in the presence of retinoids. However, the chimeric protein produced by PML-RARA has reduced affinity for retinoids. This causes inhibition of transcription, thereby preventing gene expression for cellular differentiation. This leads to the accumulation of myeloid progenitor cells. The condition is treated with all-trans retinoic acid. It binds to the PML-RARA chimeric protein.

EBV+ tumor cells express latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) which upregulates NF-B. Activation of NF-B may occur in EBV tumors as a result of the acquired loss-of-function mutations in TNF alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3). Activation of NF-B by EBV rescues crippled germinal center B cells that cannot express Igs from apoptosis, eventually leading to the formation of Reed–Sternberg cells.",

This large number of monotonous, uniform-looking, mature lymphocytes is often described as a \"convent-girl\" appearance. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) / Small lymphocytic lymphoma(SLL) is the most common leukemia among adults in the western world. The differentiating point between CLL and SLL is that in CLL the absolute lymphocyte count is >5000 per mm³ and in SLL:<5000 per mm³. It is usually asymptomatic at diagnosis but can present with easy fatigability, weight loss, and anorexia. Generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are usually seen. Total blood count: Total leukocyte count is highly variable; leukopenia is seen when the marrow is involved. Hypogammaglobulinemia is common and contributes to increased susceptibility to infections. 10% to 15% of patients develop hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia due to autoantibodies made by nonneoplastic B cells. Peripheral smear: Predominantly shows small lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm Smudge cells or basket cells or parachute cells - artifacts of the lymphocytes which are disrupted during the process of making smears. Contains a large number of monotonous, uniform-looking, mature lymphocytes, which is often described as a convent-girl appearance.

If monocytosis is 0.5 and <1 × 109/ L: supporting criteria 1 and 2 must be met. Subtype criteria: Myelodysplastic CMML (MD-CMML): WBC < 13 × 109/L Myeloproliferative CMML (MP-CMML): WBC  13 × 109/L Blasts and blast equivalents include myeloblasts, monoblasts, and promonocytes. MPN with monocytosis can mimic CMML. In these instances, a documented history of MPN excludes CMML. The presence of MPN features in the bone marrow and/or a high burden of MPN-associated mutations (JAK2, CALR, or MPL) tends to support MPN with monocytosis rather than CMML. Criteria for myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with tyrosine kinase fusions should be specifically excluded in cases with eosinophilia.

A mutation in JAK2, a key member of the cytokine intracellular signaling pathway, can be found in 90–95% of patients with polycythemia vera. It is characterized by : Increased marrow production of red cells, granulocytes, and platelets (panmyelosis) Low erythropoietin levels and elevated hematocrit Blood viscosity and sludging lead to both thrombosis and bleeding. Headache, dizziness, hypertension, dizziness, venous thrombosis (Budd Chiari syndrome due to hepatic vein thrombosis), bowel infarction, and stroke. Intense pruritus especially aquagenic pruritus Peptic ulceration, hyperuricemia 15% to 20% of patients after an average period of 10 years ->Myelofibrosis and extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis, PCV transforms into AML in 2% of patients. Primary myelofibrosis Marrow fibrosis associated with extramedullary hemopoiesis in the spleen. Activating mutation in JAK2 (more commonly) or MPL. Presence of neoplastic megakaryocytes, which are responsible for the release of fibrogenic factors like PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) and TGF- . Bone marrow aspiration yields dry tap due to fibrosis of the bone marrow. So, bone marrow biopsy is the investigation of choice, which shows the presence of hypocellularity with increased deposition of reticulin inside the marrow, abnorma megakaryocytes and the characteristic finding of dilated marrow sinusoids. Blood shows mild leukocytosis, decreased Hb and hematocrit levels, and elevated LAP scores. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in 5% to 20% of cases. Essential thrombocytosis (ET) may also be associated with JAK2, MPL, or CALR mutations. Essential thrombocytosis (ET) is often associated with activating point mutations in JAK2 (50% of cases) or MPL (5% to 10% of cases), a receptor tyrosine kinase that is normally activated by thrombopoietin. In addition, recent DNA sequencing studies have revealed that most of the remaining cases have mutations in calreticulin (CALR), a protein with several functions in the endoplasmic reticulum and the cytoplasm. Since JAK2 and calreticulin mutations are mutually exclusive, it is hypothesized that the calreticulin mutations also increase JAK-STAT signaling through mechanisms that are currently unknown. CML is the consequence of the balanced translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (t[9;22]). PV, PMF, and ET are characterized by driver mutations that directly or indirectly constitutively activate JAK2, a tyrosine kinase essential for the function of the erythropoietin andthrombopoietin receptors and also utilized by granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor.",

There is intimal thickening that reduces the luminal diameter. Granulomas with multinucleated giant cells, infiltrate of T cells (CD4+ >CD8+), and macrophages. Note : According to the 21st edition of Harrison's Medicine, as involvement of the vessel may be segmental, getting a biopsy segment of 3–5 cm together with serial sectioning of biopsy specimens would help to increase a positive yield.

Takayasu's arteritis is a granulomatous vasculitis affecting medium and large-sized arteries, in this case, the aortic arch and its branches. Clinical manifestations include vision disturbances and profound weakening of the pulses, especially in the upper extremities. Histopathology: Irregular thickening of the vessel wall is seen with associated intimal hyperplasia. Characteristic granulomatous inflammation, with the presence of giant cells and patchy media necrosis. Disease progression is associated with collagenous scarring and chronic inflammatory infiltrates across all layers of the vessel wall. Other options- Option A: Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, is an inflammation of medium and large-sized vessels. It is more common in women and people aged >50 years. The clinical features include headache associated with scalp pain and jaw claudication, fever, fatigue, malaise, and weight loss. Half of the patients have temporal artery abnormalities such as enlargement, tenderness, nodular swelling, and loss of pulse of the temporal artery, either unilateral or bilateral. Gentle pressure on the scalp may elicit focal or generalized tenderness. Though the arch of the aorta may also be involved in giant cell arteritis (known as giant cell aortitis), it is seen in people more than 50 years of age. Whereas, Takayasu arteritis is seen more commonly in adolescents and young women. Option C: Thromboangitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, is an inflammatory occlusive vascular disorder involving medium- and small-sized vessels in the distal extremities. It is most frequently seen in male smokers less than 40 years of age. Option D: Behcet's disease is a neutrophilic vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized vessels that classically presents as a clinical triad of recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, and uveitis. There can also be gastrointestinal and pulmonary manifestations, with disease mortality related to severe neurologic involvement or rupture of vascular aneurysms.",

Short QT syndrome presents with arrhythmias associated with abbreviated repolarization intervals. They also present with palpitations, syncope, and SCD. Brugada syndrome manifests as ECG abnormalities like ST-segment elevations and right bundle-branch block. This occurs in the absence of structural heart disease. Here, patients classically present with syncope or SCD during rest or sleep or after large meals.

Aerobic exercise, e.g., long-distance running, is associated with volume-load hypertrophy accompanied by an increase in capillary density. This is not seen in other forms of hypertrophy. This decreases resting heart rate and blood pressure. In hypertrophy due to pressure or volume overload, there is a sustained increase in mechanical work. This cause myocytes to increase in size thus increasing the size and weight of the heart. The hypertrophied heart has an increased oxygen consumption but decreased supply. This is because hypertrophy is not accompanied by a proportional increase in capillary numbers. This leads to ischemia-related decompensation, which can evolve to cardiac failure and eventually lead to death. The causes and consequences of hypertrophy are summarized in the below image. Heart weight, rather than wall thickness, is the best measure of hypertrophy in dilated hearts. A patient with systemic hypertension has pressure-overload hypertrophy. A patient with an echo finding of an aortic valvular area of 0.6cm² is suggestive of aortic stenosis. There is pressure-overload hypertrophy. A patient with a high pitched holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex is suggestive of mitral regurgitation. There is volume-overload hypertrophy. Congenital and Valvular Heart Disease",

The cardinal anatomical changes of the mitral valve in chronic RHD are: Leaflet thickening Commissural fusion and shortening Thickening and fusion of the tendinous chords Infective endocarditis has large, irregular, friable masses on the valve cusps that can extend onto the chordae. These vegetations can be single or multiple and may involve one or more valves. They are potentially destructive lesions and contain fibrin, inflammatory cells, bacteria or other organisms. They can erode into the underlying myocardium and produce a ring abscess. They are prone to embolisations, resulting in abscess formation wherever they lodge due to the presence of virulent organisms. Thus, it may lead to sequelae like septic infarcts or mycotic aneurysms. Subacute infective endocarditis contains less destructive vegetations. They contain granulation tissue at their bases indicative of healing. Fibrosis, calcification and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate can develop over the time. Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis is characterised by one or more small, 1-5 mm, sterile vegetations which are usually attached at the line of closure. They are seen associated with hypercoagulable states like chronic DIC or malignancy. They are loosely attached to the underlying valve and are non-destructive in nature. They do not cause any inflammatory reaction but they can be a source of systemic embolisation. Libman-Sack's endocarditis has small- or medium-sized, 1- 4 mm, sterile vegetations associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. They may be present on one or both the sides of the leaflets, on the valve surface, chordae or anywhere on the endocardium. These vegetations develop due to immune complex deposition and complement activation. They cause intense valvulitis resulting in fibrinoid necrosis of the valve substance. Persistent injury to the valves can result in scarring and leaflet fusion.",

Hence it is also called mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis. There are 2 types of MPGN: Type I - It is characterized by the deposition of immune complexes and mesangiocapillary proliferation. Type II - It is now known as dense-deposit disease. It belongs to a group of disorders called C3 glomerulopathies. Light microscopy findings of MPGN are as follows: Lobular glomeruli with proliferating mesangial cells, capillary endothelium, and infiltrating leukocytes (endocapillary proliferation) Duplication of the basement membrane gives a double contour or tram-track appearance. It is especially evident in silver or PAS stains. Tubulointerstitial, Vascular and Cystic Diseases",

Cryptorchidism is the failure of the descent of the intra-abdominal testes into the scrotal sac. It is the most common congenital abnormality of the genitourinary tract. The testes can arrest anywhere during descent, and the most common site is the inguinal region. Phases of testicular descent: Transabdominal phase: Testes come to lie in the lower abdomen or pelvis. This phase of descent is regulated by Mullerian-inhibiting substances. Inguinoscrotal phase: Testes descend along the inguinal canal and reach the scrotal sac. This phase of the descent is regulated by androgen-induced calcitonin gene-related peptide from the genitofemoral nerve. The exact pathogenesis remains unknown, however, deficiency in gonadotropins and Mullerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) and increased expression of estradiol in the placenta are thought to play a role. It is associated with testicular atrophy and dysfunction, which result in sterility. Cryptorchid testes carry a 3–5-fold higher risk for testicular cancer (usually seminoma).",

The Sertoli cells are supporting cells that are under the action of FSH. Leydig cells, which are present in the interstitial spaces, are under the action of luteinizing hormone(LH) and produce testosterone. Testosterone has a feedback inhibition on LH. In Sertoli cell-only syndrome, within the seminiferous tubules, only Sertoli cells are seen and no germ cells. Hence, there are no spermatozoa and there is no feedback inhibition, which results in increased FSH levels. So, testosterone levels, and LH levels remain unaffected since Leydig cells are not affected. Hence, the patient will have male secondary sexual characters.

Adult torsion is typically seen in adolescence and presents with the sudden onset of testicular pain. Neonatal torsion can occur either in utero or shortly after birth and the cause is unknown. It results from a bilateral anatomic defect that leads to increased mobility of the testes (bell- clapper□ abnormality). Twisting of the spermatic cord typically cuts off the venous drainage of the testis. But, thick-walled arteries remain patent, producing intense vascular engorgement, followed by hemorrhagic infarction. If the testis is manually untwisted within approximately 6 hours of the onset of torsion, there is a good chance that the testis will remain viable.",

The most common presenting feature is testicular swelling or gynecomastia (~15% of cases). In children, hormonal effects manifested primarily as sexual precocity, are the dominant features. Tumors of Leydig cells may secrete androgens and estrogens, and even corticosteroids. Grossly it shows golden brown, homogeneous circumscribed nodules <5 cm in diameter. Histologically: large, round, or polygonal cells round central nucleus and prominent nucleoli abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm containing lipid droplets, vacuoles, or lipofuscin pigment crystalloids of Reinke, rod-shaped eosinophilic cytoplasmic bodies are seen in about 25% of the tumors Option A: Spermatocytic tumor mainly occurs in older adults as a slow-growing testicular mass. They are usually hormonally silent Option B: Sertoli cell tumor mostly presents as a painless testicular mass. They are usually hormonally silent. Hence, gynecomastia and precocious puberty are very rare. Option C: Granulosa cell tumor usually presents as a slow-growing and non-functioning testicular mass. Gynecomastia is rare.

PSA is a product of prostatic epithelium secreted in the semen. Measurement of serum PSA levels is widely used to assist the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of prostate cancer. Older men have a higher serum PSA level than younger men, so the normal range varies with age. The serum PSA levels as a screening test for prostatic cancer has poor sensitivity and specificity. This is because various other factors such as trauma, infections, BPH, instrumentation/digital exam of the prostate, and ejaculation can increase serum PSA levels. A value of 4 ng/mL usually warrants serial testing or further evaluation. In an effort to improve the sensitivity and specificity of serum PSA levels, many novel indices are used: Age-specific PSA reference ranges PSA velocity: Rate of change of PSA values with time. It is considered that PSA velocity of 0.75 ng/mL per year measured at least 3 times over a period of 1.5 to 2 yrs is significant to diagnose Prostate cancer.

The gene encodes a copper transporting ATPase (ATP7B) which has 2 functions: Maintains copper in bound form by binding copper to apoceruloplasmin Helps excrete free copper in bile. The resulting ATP7B deficiency leads to reduced bound copper and impaired free copper excretion. This causes excess deposition of free copper in the tissues, particularly in the liver, brain and eye. Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive condition leading to impaired absorption of copper and subsequent copper deficiency. Here, the mutation is in the ATP7A gene.",

The cells marked as B are Chief cells. Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome is caused by gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors, which leads to parital cell hyperplasia. Gastrinomas are almost always found in the small intestine or pancreas. The most remarkable feature found in the stomach is an increase in oxyntic mucosal thickness due to massive parietal cell hyperplasia. Other options: Option A and C: Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of autoantibodies that impairs the production or activity of the intrinsic factor (IF) that is released from the parietal cells, which is required for the uptake of vitamin B12. There are three types of autoantibodies namely, type I, II, and III. The action of each of these include: Autoantibody type I prevents the binding of vitamin B12 to the intrinsic factor (IF). Autoantibody type II prevents the binding of vitamin B12-IF complex to the ileal receptors. Autoantibody type III acts against the  and  subunits of the gastric proton pump, which impairs the production of intrinsic factor. These patients also develop chronic atrophic gastritis, characterized by loss of parietal cells, infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells, and megaloblastic changes in mucosal cells. Option B: Gastric carcinoid tumors originate from gastric enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. They are referred to as well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. The peak incidence of carcinoid tumors is in the 6th decade. These tumors occur throughout the GI tract, most commonly in the appendix, ileum, and rectum, in decreasing order of frequency. Gastric carcinoid tumors may be associated with endocrine cell hyperplasia, autoimmune chronic atrophic gastritis, MEN-I, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome.

Clinical features of MVID are: Profuse watery, secretory diarrhea - before 3 months of age (often in the first few days of life) Metabolic acidosis Hypotonic dehydration Diagnosis of MVID include: Electron microscopy - Inclusion containing microvilli in the apical cytoplasm of the intestinal cells. Brush border microvilli are poorly developed with only a few/blunted microvilli Immunostaining of villin (the brush border protein) CD10 immunohistochemistry to detect microvillus inclusions Treatment is total parenteral nutrition and small bowel transplantation. The following electron microscopy image shows characteristic intracytoplasmic inclusions that are lined by intact microvilli along the absorptive surfaces of the intestinal cells.

During normal embryogenesis, the neural crest cells migrate from the caecum to the rectum. The enteric neuronal plexuses develop from these migrated neural crest cells. In Hirschsprung disease, there is an arrest in the migration of these cells, which leads to the development of a distal intestinal segment that is devoid of Meissner (submucosal) and the Auerbach (myenteric) plexus. Hence this segment is referred to as the aganglionic segment. As a result, there is a lack of coordination in the peristaltic contractions and functional obstruction, which further leads to the dilation of the intestine proximal to the affected segment, leading to congenital megacolon. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the absence of ganglion cells in biopsy sections. Some conditions may cause acquired megacolon. These include: Chagas disease, due to the loss of ganglion cells Visceral myopathy Obstruction by neoplasm or inflammatory stricture Toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis Functional psychosomatic disorders",

The risk factors for Mendelson's syndrome include: Gastric volume > 25 mL (0.4 mL/kg) Gastric pH < 2.5 Incidence of aspiration can be reduced by administration of: Non-particulate antacids like sodium citrate 30-45 minutes prior to intubation H2 receptor antagonists like intravenous ranitidine Metoclopramide 1-2 hours prior to induction Option B: Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is a type of ILD associated with Masson bodies and plugs of loose connective tissue on histology. Option C: CMV pneumonia is associated with the owl's eye appearance on histology. Option D: PCP pneumonia is associated with black-walled cysts on silver staining.",

Asbestos bodies are a typical finding. They are golden brown, fusiform, or beaded rods with a translucent center. They consist of asbestos fibers coated with an iron-containing proteinaceous material and arise when these fibers are phagocytosed by macrophages. Other inorganic particulates may become coated with similar iron-protein complexes and are called ferruginous bodies.",

The black color is due to the deposition of carbon particles. The inhaled carbon particles are engulfed by the lung macrophages and then transported to the hilar lymph nodes. This accumulates and causes the blackening of the lung tissues or anthracosis. It is commonly seen in people who work in environments where there is high air pollution with carbon particles, such as coal mines. It is also the most common exogenous pigment found in the human body as a result of air pollution in urban areas. The aggregates of the carbon dust may induce fibroblastic reaction or emphysema that may lead to a condition called coal worker's pneumoconiosis. The following image shows anthracosis with deposition of black carbon particles, within the cytoplasm of macrophages. Option B: Melanin is brown-black in color which occurs as a result of oxidation of tyrosine in melanocytes, as shown in the following histopathology of a lymph node. Option C: Lipochrome or lipofuscin (brown lipid) is seen as a yellow-brown pigment in histopathological sections of the liver and heart of normal aging patients, patients with severe malnutrition, and cancer cachexia. It is derived through lipid peroxidation and indicates free radical injury and lipid peroxidation.

These tumors may present with: Mass in the neck Dysphagia Hoarseness Diarrhea due to the secretion of VIP Cushing's syndrome due to ACTH secretion Histopathology shows polygonal to spindle-shaped cells, which may form nests, trabeculae, and even follicles. Acellular amyloid deposits derived from calcitonin polypeptides are present in the stroma. These lesions secrete calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen. The Adrenals",

This results in keratin spillage into the surrounding periductal tissue forming a chronic granulomatous inflammatory response. It presents with a painful erythematous subareolar mass that clinically mimics bacterial abscess. It has a high recurrence rate.",

The absence of carbonic anhydrase II prevents osteoclasts from acidifying the resorption pit and dissolution of calcium hydroxyapatite within the bone matrix. It also blocks the acidification of urine by the renal tubular cells. This leads to reduced bone resorption and diffuse symmetric skeletal sclerosis. Due to deficient osteoclast activity, bones involved by osteopetrosis lack a medullary canal giving it a bone-in-bone appearance. The ends of long bones are bulbous (Erlenmeyer flask deformity) and misshapen. The neural foramina are small and compress the exiting nerves, leading to cranial nerve palsies. Extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis leads to leukopenia and prominent hepatosplenomegaly.

The inflammation progresses to the destruction of the articular cartilage and ankylosis of the joints. In RA, the synovium contains germinal centers with secondary follicles and abundant plasma cells, which produce antibodies, some are autoantibodies. Many of the autoantibodies produced in the lymphoid organs are specific for citrullinated peptides (CCPs). 80% of patients have serum IgM or IgA autoantibodies that bind to the Fc portions of their own IgG. These autoantibodies are called rheumatoid factor and may also deposit in joints as immune complexes The characteristic histologic features of RA include: Synovial cell hyperplasia and proliferation Dense inflammatory infiltrates Increased vascularity due to angiogenesis Fibrinopurulent exudate on the synovial and joint surfaces Osteoclastic activity in underlying bone Subcutaneous nodule: necrotizing granulomas with a central zone of fibrinoid necrosis surrounded activated macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells This altogether leads to a mass of edematous synovium called pannus, which grows over the articular cartilage and causes its erosion.",

The distinctive morphologic changes in gout are acute arthritis, chronic tophaceous arthritis, tophi in various sites, and gouty nephropathy. Tophi are the pathognomonic hallmark of gout. These are large aggregations of urate crystals surrounded by an intense inflammatory reaction of foreign body giant cells which may appear in the articular cartilage, ligaments, tendons, bursae, earlobes, fingertips, or kidneys.

This change is called neurotization and suggests the benign nature of the nevus. This morphological change in nevus cells occurs due to progressive loss of tyrosinase activity and acquisition of cholinesterase activity in deeper “nervelike” nevus cells. Melanocytic nevi (moles) are common benign neoplasms caused by acquired activating mutations in components of the RAS signaling pathway. Based on the location, it may be junctional nevi, intradermal nevi, or compound nevi. Melanocytic nevi are thought to progress through a series of morphologic changes over time. Superficial nevus cells are larger, tend to produce melanin, and grow in nests. Deeper nevus cells are smaller, produce little or no pigment, and appear as cords and single cells. At the deepest extent of the lesions, these cells often acquire fusiform contours and grow in fascicles resembling neural tissue (neurotization). Melanocytic nevi with neurotization indicate normal maturation change and help in differentiating benign nevi from melanomas (which lacks such features).",

Cerebral toxoplasmosis is an opportunistic infection commonly found in the setting of HIV-associated immunosuppression. Toxoplasmosis of the CNS produces brain abscesses, which are found most often in the cerebral cortex (near the grey-white junction) and deep gray nuclei. Lesions of acute cerebral toxoplasmosis exhibit central necrosis, petechial haemorrhages surrounded by acute and chronic inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and vascular proliferation. Both free tachyzoites and encysted bradyzoites may be found at the periphery of the necrotic foci. Chronic lesions consist of small cystic spaces containing scattered lipid and hemosiderin-laden macrophages that are surrounded by gliotic brain. Option A: In cerebral malaria caused by P. falciparum, brain vessels are plugged with parasitized red cells. Around the vessels, ring hemorrhages and small focal inflammatory reactions (called malarial or Dürck granulomata) are seen.

The formation and aggregation of A peptides are responsible for AD. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is neurotrophic and neuroprotective. It is present in astrocytes and neuroglia. This protein is cleaved at 3 sites by secretase enzymes (,  , and ), and the products are known as A peptides. In Alzheimer's disease, A peptides get aggregated in the form of amyloid plaques, which stain positive for Congo red. These get deposited within the neural tissue (A 42) and the cerebral arterioles (A 40 protein, causing CAA), which causes neuronal dysfunction, and is the first sign of AD. Normally, tau proteins within the neurons stabilize microtubules, however, in AD, these get hyperphosphorylated and lose their function. Hyperphosphorylated tau proteins combine with cytoplasmic fibrils, to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and get abnormally accumulated around the neuronal nucleus.",

Progression of transtentorial herniation is often accompanied by secondary hemorrhagic lesions in the midbrain and pons, termed Duret hemorrhages. These linear or flame - shaped lesions usually occur in the midline and paramedian regions and are believed to be due to the distortion or tearing of penetrating veins and arteries supplying the upper brainstem. With increasing displacement of the temporal lobe, the third cranial nerve is compromised, resulting in pupillary dilation and impairment of ocular movements on the side of the lesion. The posterior cerebral artery may also be compressed, resulting in ischemic injury to the territory supplied by that vessel, including the primary visual cortex. When the extent of herniation is large enough, the contralateral cerebral peduncle may be compressed, resulting in hemiparesis ipsilateral to the side of the herniation. The compression in the peduncle in this setting is known as the Kernohan notch.",

It is an X-linked recessive condition. Duchenne's and Becker's muscular dystrophy are caused by loss-of-function mutations in the dystrophin gene on the X chromosome. It is one of the largest human genes. Dystrophin provides mechanical stability to the myofiber during muscle contraction. Defects in the complex may lead to small membrane tears that permit the influx of calcium, triggering events that result in myofiber degeneration. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is associated with deletions or frame-shift mutations that result in the total absence of dystrophin. Immunohistochemical studies for dystrophin show the absence of the normal sarcolemmal staining pattern. In contrast, the mutations in Becker's muscular dystrophy typically permit the synthesis of a truncated version of dystrophin, which retains some function. Immunohistochemical studies for dystrophin show reduced staining.",

It is a T-cell mediated immune response. GBS is usually associated with a history of upper respiratory infection (URI) or acute gastroenteritis (AGE) 1-3 weeks prior. The causative organisms may be Campylobacter jejuni, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It presents with the following features: Ascending motor paralysis (lower limbs > upper limbs) Sensory deficits may or may not be seen Deep tendon reflexes - absent Transient bladder dysfunction - severe cases Autonomic manifestations - loss of vasomotor control, postural hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias Histological examination shows inflammation of peripheral nerves, manifested as perivenular and endoneurial infiltration by lymphocytes, macrophages, and a few plasma cells. On electron microscopy, an early effect on myelin sheaths is seen. There is segmental demyelination induced by the actions of activated macrophages. There are several types of Guillain–Barre syndrome: Demyelinating Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) - most common Axonal Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) Acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) Regional GBS syndromes: Miller–Fisher syndrome (MFS)",
