At the anode, fast-moving electrons interact with the atoms of the anode in one of the following ways: Nucleus field interaction: aka continuous spectrum radiation or Bremsstrahlung reaction (80%) Inner shell interaction: produces characteristic spectrum radiation (20%) Important parameters with respect to X rays: Kilovolt peak (kVP) – Potential difference between cathode and anode. When the voltage increases, energy increases, and penetration also increases. Hence more kVP is required for obese patients. Milliampere second (mAS) – Determines the amount of film blackening. More MAS more is radiation exposure. Contrast is influenced by both kVP and mAS. kVP is inversely proportional whereas mAS is directly proportional to the contrast produced.",

When the inner shell electron is ejected, the outer electron goes into the inner orbit to occupy the space, and the extra energy is ejected as characteristic radiation, and is called the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect is fundamentally important in diagnostic radiography since it is the primary method by which contrast is developed in radiographs. It allows for the differentiation of different types of tissues on the X-ray film. Very low-energy X-rays are not capable of producing the photoelectric effect. High energy X-rays are also not capable of photoelectric effect due to random scattering of electrons from the outer shell. This is known as the Compton effect and it can lead to distortion of the image. The goal of X-ray imaging should be to minimize the Compton effect and maximize the photoelectric effect. The penetrating power of X-rays increases with increasing energy, which is directly proportional to the frequency and inversely proportional to the wavelength.",

As the safest radiological investigation for pregnancy, it provides crucial information without posing any risks to the mother or fetus, making it indispensable in obstetric care. Different modes in USG and its uses are as follows: A (amplitude) mode: Used in ophthalmology and orbital biometry (option A). B (brightness) mode: Used for all routine applications, with brightness encoded as grayscale value (option B). M (motion) mode: In echocardiography. HIFU (high-intensity focussed USG) is a therapeutic application of USG. It is useful for the treatment of fibroids. HIFU exploits the thermal effects of high-powered, tightly focused ultrasound beams so that very small target tissues can be heated and coagulated. The image below depicts a duplex scan, which is a combination of B-mode imaging and pulsed Doppler data acquisition. Doppler ultrasound (option D) is used in diagnosing peripheral arterial disease. It uses a handheld Doppler ultrasound probe placed at an arterial site. A normal arterial wave has a triphasic signal. A triphasic wave has three waveforms consisting of a sharp systolic wave with a forward uprise and fall, a second wave with reverse flow occurring in diastole, and the last wave with a forward flow taking place during diastole. Doppler ultrasound can detect moving blood. However, it does not provide information on whether the blood flow is sufficient for the maintenance of limb viability. The image below shows triphasic signal on doppler ultrasound:",

Contraindications: Renal failure - Gd-DTPA is predominantly excreted through the kidney. Hence, in renal failure, it gets accumulated in the body and releases gadolinium ions. Since the ion is toxic, the body tries to contain it by fibrosis resulting in multisystem painful fibrosis called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. As a result, gadolinium-containing contrast is contraindicated in patients with an estimated GFR under 60 ml/min and especially under 30 ml/min. Pregnancy - Due to the risk of teratogenicity Gadolinium does not cross the blood-brain barrier unless the barrier is disrupted. Optison and Levovist are ultrasound contrast agents.

The pressure from the collected gas displaces the two lobes of the thymic tissue upward and laterally from its normal position. This results in large, wedge-shaped opacities on radiograph resembling the spinnaker headsails of a boat. This should be distinguished from a thymic sail sign which is a normal finding on a neonatal chest x-ray. It represents a physiologically enlarged thymus in a neonate. Other signs of pneumomediastinum are: V sign of Naclerio - It is due to a V-shaped air collection.

Clinical features include acute onset fever, cough (with or without sputum production), and shortness of breath. In some cases, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxemia, or increased work of breathing may be present on physical examination. A chest X-ray can be used to diagnose pneumonia. The presence of an infiltrate on a plain chest radiograph is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pneumonia. Radiographic findings consistent with the diagnosis of CAP include lobar consolidations (along with air bronchograms within the opacity), interstitial infiltrates, and/or cavitations. A CT chest is used for better resolution or if the chest X-ray was non-diagnostic. Blood and sputum cultures are obtained to guide the antibiotic regimen. Other options: Option A: The radiological features of lung abscess include a thick-walled, irregular cavity containing an air-fluid level, often accompanied by surrounding pulmonary infiltrates. The cavity typically forms an acute angle with the chest wall. Computed tomography (CT) is more sensitive than chest radiography and is used to detect small cavities that may not be visible on standard X-rays. The accompanying X-ray image illustrates these features, showing thick-walled cavities with air-fluid levels on the lateral view: Option C: Pleural effusion may present with dyspnea, pleuritic pain, dry cough, and associated symptoms like fever, weight loss, oedema, and ascites depending on the aetiology. On examination, there may be tachypnea, dullness on percussion and decreased/absent breath sounds at the base(s). The given X-ray image below shows left-sided pleural effusion: Option D: In pneumothorax, the patient will present with a history of breathlessness, and chest X-ray will show deep costophrenic angle, hyperlucency (darker area without lung markings) with inward shifting of the visceral pleural line (sharp white line). In tension pneumothorax, there will be a mediastinal shift to the opposite side. The image below shows a left pneumothorax with total left lung collapse and tracheal deviation to the right.",

        "explanation": "The marked finding is known as the Monod sign, which is seen in aspergilloma. It refers to the presence of gas surrounding a fungal mass within a pulmonary cavity. Aspergillomas (non-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis): Aspergillus fumigatus can cause mass-like fungus ball formation in structurally abnormal lungs (pre-existing cavities like in pulmonary tuberculosis). On Plain film and CT, an intracavitary mass surrounded by a crescent of air (Monod sign), is typically observed, as shown below. Angioinvasive aspergillosis occurs primarily in immunocompromised patients. On HRCT, it is characterised by ground-glass opacity surrounding a pulmonary nodule or mass called a halo sign. This sign indicates a haemorrhage. The below CT image depicts halo sign in invasive aspergillosis. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an immune reaction. The below image depicts gloved finger appearance of ABPA in the left upper lobe. It is a characteristic sign of bronchocele. Other options: Option A: Blastomycosis is a chronic infection, characterized by the formation of suppurative and granulomatous lesions, especially in the lungs and skin. The pulmonary disease resembles TB or histoplasmosis. There can be focal or diffuse consolidation, miliary lesions, or abscess formation. Option B: A patient presenting with fever, breathlessness, and cough with expectoration is most likely suffering from pneumonia. The CT image shows a sharply demarcated homogenous consolidation that crosses segmental boundaries and involves only a single lobe, suggestive of lobar pneumonia. The below CT scan image is highly suggestive of pneumonia in which consolidation with an air bronchogram can be seen. Option D: Bronchiectasis is characterized by local and irreversible dilatation of bronchi. Radiographic findings are tramline appearance (seen on chest X-rays) and ring or curvilinear opacities on end-on appearance. CT shows bronchial dilatation and lack of tapering of the bronchial lumen (cardinal sign) and signet-ring sign (internal diameter of the bronchi is greater than the adjacent pulmonary artery). CT image below shows thickened, dilated airways and signet-ring sign:",

        "explanation": "Based on the clinical scenario and the X-ray showing a box-shaped cardiac silhouette caused by right atrial enlargement, this is typically seen in Ebstein's anomaly. Ebstein anomaly is characterized by an abnormal tricuspid valve that is displaced downwards into the right ventricle. Hence, a part of the right ventricle is now located above the tricuspid valve. This is called atrialization of the ventricle. There can be associated tricuspid regurgitation with or without stenosis. ray findings depend on the degree to which the tricuspid valve is displaced downwards. The features are an enlarged right atrium which causes severe right-sided cardiomegaly, giving rise to a box-shaped cardiac shadow and pulmonary oligemia. Other options: Option B: Pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect (VSD), aorta overriding the VSD and right ventricular hypertrophy are the defining features of Tetralogy of Fallot, a cyanotic congenital heart disease. X-ray findings show characteristic 'coeur-en-sabot' or boot-shaped heart. Option C: Pulmonary veins returning to the right atrium or systemic venous circulation instead of the left atrium, define total anomalous pulmonary venous circulation, a congenital cardiac malformation, with supracardiac variety being the most common. As a result, a large supracardiac shadow can be seen with normal cardiac shadow and gives a characteristic pattern of snowman appearance/ figure of 8 on chest X-ray. Option D: Failure of the embryonic common truncus arteriosus to divide into the aorta and pulmonary artery characterises truncus arteriosus, a cyanotic congenital heart anomaly. A single great artery arises from the heart, supplying both the pulmonary and systemic circulation. This condition is associated with pulmonary plethora, unlike tetralogy of Fallot and is characterised by the sitting duck appearance of the heart on X-ray.",

MRI is the preferred modality for assessing suspected diffuse axonal injury, even in patients with normal CT of the brain. Gradient-recalled echo (GRE) & susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) are the most sensitive MRI sequences for detecting micro-bleeds, which appear as hypointense foci.",

Tension pneumocephalus is a rare, life-threatening condition most commonly caused by traumatic head injury. Other causes include skull base fractures, neurosurgical procedures, infections (meningitis, encephalitis, or brain abscess), brain tumours, or the use of nitrous oxide during anaesthesia. The mass effect exerted by the subdural air compresses the underlying brain parenchyma, often resulting from a ball-valve mechanism causing one-way air entry into the subdural space. This raises intracranial pressure (ICP), distinguishing it from non-tension pneumocephalus, which lacks significant mass effect or raised ICP. The elevated ICP leads to rapid clinical deterioration, such as worsening consciousness, necessitating urgent neurosurgical intervention to decompress the trapped air and prevent permanent brain damage.",

Hemangioblastomas are tumours of vascular origin and occur both in patients with Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease as well as sporadically. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease characterises the development of numerous benign and malignant tumours in different organs. It is associated with a mutation in the VHL tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 3 (VHL has 3 letters: chromosome 3). They are WHO-grade I tumours that can occur in the central nervous system. Features of VHL include pheochromocytoma, CNS hemangioblastoma - cerebellar and spinal, retinal haemangioblastoma, and choroid plexus papilloma. Other options: Option A: Neurofibromatosis is an autosomal-dominant neurocutaneous syndrome of 2 types: NF1 (neurofibromatosis 1) is also called as Von Recklinghausen disease. It involves the NF1 gene n chromosome 17. It is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple café-au-lait macules and associated cutaneous neurofibromas. NF2 (Central neurofibromatosis) is caused by the mutation on chromosome 22 and predisposes individuals to multiple nervous system tumours. Most common are bilateral vestibular schwannomas, intracranial and spinal meningiomas, gliomas, neurofibromas, and posterior subcapsular lenticular opacities. On MRI, extracanalicular extension of vestibular schwannomas into the cerebellopontine angle can lead to an \"ice cream cone\" appearance as shown below: Option C: Tuberous sclerosis is a multi-system neurocutaneous syndrome caused by the mutation of genes coding for hamartin (chromosome 9) and tuberin (chromosome 16), which leads to the formation of angiomyolipomas, cysts in kidneys, multiple hamartomas, giant cell astrocytomas, and cortical tubers. Skin manifestation includes facial angiofibroma (adenoma sebaceum), shagreen patch and confetti skin lesions. It can also be associated with renal angiomyolipoma and cardiac rhabdomyoma. The CT image given below shows calcified subependymal hamartomatous nodules: Option D: Sturge Weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous disorder(phakomatoses) that is characterized by unilateral capillary malformation at the region of trigeminal supply known as port wine stain or nevus flammeus, ipsilateral diffuse cavernous hemangioma of the choroid and ipsilateral leptomeningeal hemangiomatosis, which causes seizures and mental retardation. Features of MRI brain include pial angioma, seen as a diffuse pial enhancement of variable thickness, enlargement of the ipsilateral choroid plexus and dilatation of trans-parenchymal veins that communicate between the superficial and deep cerebral venous systems.

Multiple sclerosis(MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation, multiple demyelinating plaques, and relapsing and remitting symptoms. It is commonly associated with paresthesia (tingling sensations), hypesthesia (numbness), optic neuritis, unilateral/ bilateral, limb weakness - spastic paralysis, Babinski's sign positive and bladder dysfunction. Optic neuritis (ON) presents as diminished visual acuity or decreased colour perception (desaturation) in the central field of vision. MRI is used for making the diagnosis of MS due to its high sensitivity. The diagnosis of MS requires demonstrating that the lesions are disseminated in space (involving multiple areas of the brain) and in time (multiple episodes over a period of time). The MRI below demonstrates Dawson's fingers, the demyelinating plaques through the corpus callosum, arranged at right angles along medullary veins (callososeptal location). Other options: Option A: A \"puff of smoke appearance\", derived from the Japanese term Moyamoya, is a characteristic finding on cerebral X-ray angiography in patients with Moyamoya disease. This rare, non-inflammatory, progressive, occlusive disease involves large intracranial arteries exhibiting bimodal age distribution in the first and fourth decades. Childhood moyamoya is characterised by ischemic manifestations, and adult moyamoya by hemorrhagic manifestations. The below image shows the MR angiography findings in a patient with Moyamoya disease. As this is a chronic condition, the lenticulostriate arteries develop a rich collateral circulation around the occlusive lesion, seen as a 'puff of smoke' (moyamoya in Japanese) on X-ray angiography as shown below: Option B: Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an autosomal-recessive disease resulting from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A, causing central and peripheral demyelination, ataxia, and dementia. Symmetric confluent areas of T2 hyperintensity are seen in the periventricular white matter. Radiating T2 hypointense lines through the demyelinated deep white matter represent the sparing of the perivascular white matter. This results in the tigroid and leopard skin patterns when imaged in the long axis or cross-section, respectively. Subcortical U-fibers are spared. The below MRI shows tigroid pattern: Option D: Progressive supranuclear palsy is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by atrophy of structures at the midbrain-diencephalic junction (e.g., superior colliculi, red nuclei, subthalamic nuclei, and globus pallidus) and cerebellum (dentate nuclei), and mild cortical atrophy. MRI shows a hummingbird sign (atrophy of midbrain structures with a relatively intact pons region). Brain Tumors, Neurodegenerative & Demyelinating Disorders",

The two variants of craniopharyngioma are: Adamantinomatous type (common in children): Predominantly solid with cystic components. Diagnostic features include compact lamellar keratin (\"wet keratin\") and areas of dystrophi calcification. Papillary type (common in adults): Contains both solid sheets and papillae lined by well-differentiated non-keratinized squamous epithelium. These tumours are usually large and heterogeneous, displaying solid and cystic components. The cysts contain a cholesterol-rich, thick brownish-yellow fluid that is compared to 'machine oil'. Clinical features include headaches (most common), visual abnormalities - decreased acuity and bitemporal hemianopia, GH deficiency, growth failure, delayed sexual maturation due to pituitary hypofunction, and polyuria (central diabetes insipidus). Radiologically: CT may show calcifications associated with the solid and cystic wall components MRI is the imaging modality of choice which shows: Craniopharyngiomas tend not to expand the pituitary fossa unless they become huge, which is a differentiating feature from pituitary macroadenomas. Other options: Option A: Pituitary apoplexy is an acute clinical condition associated with the rapid expansion of the pituitary gland, which is evident on an MRI as enhancement around a non-enhancing infarcted centre.

Irrespective of their histological or genetic characterization, medulloblastomas correspond histologically to WHO grade IV tumors. Radiological findings include: CT & MRI: CT shows a hyperdense midline vermian mass adjoining the roof of the 4th ventricle and causing hydrocephalus. MRI shows T2 hypointensity or isointensity compared to the grey matter. The CT and MRI findings also reflect the increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and densely packed cells of the tumor. DWI: restricted diffusion MR spectroscopy: reduced N-acetyl aspartate(NAA) peak with an increased choline-to-creatine ratio. The CT and MRI findings, supported by the presence of restricted diffusion on DWI, are the most reliable observations in differentiating medulloblastoma from ependymoma or other posterior fossa tumors. Standard treatment for medulloblastomas includes surgical resection, with adjuvant craniospinal radiotherapy for those over 3 years of age and chemotherapy. Other options: Option A: Pilocytic astrocytoma is a brain tumor that occurs more often in children and young adults. These tumors are usually slow-growing and benign. The majority of neoplasms are located in the cerebellum. However, they can also appear around the third ventricle, optic nerves, spinal cord, and occasionally in the cerebral hemispheres. Mural nodule, a contrast medium enhancing nodule within the wall of a cystic mass, is seen on MRI. Option C: Ependymomas are tumours that arise from the ependyma-lined ventricular system, typically on the floor of the fourth ventricle. In adults, the spinal cord is their most common location; tumors in this site are particularly frequent in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 2. They are well-demarcated lobulated mass lesions that show calcifications on CT in over 50% and are of mixed signal intensity on MRI. Option D: Craniopharyngiomas are tumors that arise from the remnants of Rathke’s pouch. It is an intracranial space-occupying lesion. It has a bimodal age of presentation. These tumors are usually large and heterogeneous, displaying both solid and cystic components, and occur within the suprasellar area.

They are a non-glial neoplasm that originates from the meningocytes or arachnoid cap cells of the meninges and are located anywhere that meninges are found. Meningioma shows female predominance that may be related to the fact that some meningiomas contain estrogen and progesterone receptors. They are also associated with NF-2 gene mutation. Typical meningiomas appear as dural-based masses isointense to grey matter on both T1 and T2 weighted imaging and demonstrate vivid contrast enhancement on both MRI and CT. CSF vascular cleft sign indicates that the mass is extra-axial. There is a cleft between the tumour and normal brain parenchyma.

Multiple system atrophy (a type of synucleinopathies) is a neurodegenerative disorder with varying&deg; of involvement of the basal ganglia and the olivopontocerebellar complex. Autonomic dysfunction is more severe and generalised, often presenting as orthostatic hypotension. MSA has been divided clinically into two forms according to the dominant non-autonomic symptoms: MSA-C: Predominance of cerebellar symptoms (olivopontocerebellar atrophy) MSA-P: Predominance of Parkinsonian signs and symptoms (striatonigral degeneration) MRI is a valuable diagnostic adjunct, often revealing cerebellar and brainstem atrophy causing pontine hot cross bun sign. The axial T2-weighted image at the level of middle cerebellar peduncles below shows the hot cross bun sign: Other options: Option B: Multiple system atrophy-parkinsonian type (MSA-P) is characterised by atypical parkinsonism that is symmetrical and predominantly axial, with tremors less prominent compared to Parkinson's disease. MRI typically reveals hyperintensities along the lateral aspect of the putamina, and T2-weighted imaging may demonstrate hypointensity in the striatum due to iron deposition. Although not exclusive to MSA, the hot cross bun sign is more commonly seen in MSA-C than in MSA-P. Option C: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a form of atypical parkinsonism characterized by slow ocular saccades, eyelid apraxia, and restricted vertical eye movements with downward gaze palsy. Patients also have hyperextension of the neck with gait disturbances and frequent falls. MRI may reveal characteristic atrophy of the midbrain with normal pons, which is called a hummingbird sign.",

Central pontine myelinolysis, also known as osmotic demyelination syndrome, is a non-inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the white matter tracts, commonly involving the pons. It typically occurs following rapid correction of severe hyponatremia, resulting in hypertonic stress in astrocytes within the brain, causing demyelination without inflammation at the base of the pons, with relative sparing of axons and nerve cells. Clinically, patients present one or more days after the overcorrection of hyponatremia with paraparesis or quadriparesis, diplopia, a “locked-in syndrome,” dysphagia, and dysarthria with/without loss of consciousness. MRI is useful in establishing the diagnosis. Owl's eye appearance on T2 MRI is seen due to sparing of the peripheral pontine fibres and the descending corticospinal tracts.

        "explanation": "The above clinical presentation, along with the MRI brain showing a cyst with a dot sign (representing an eccentrically placed scolex within a parasitic cyst), is characteristic of neurocysticercosis. Neurocysticercosis is the most common form of cysticercosis and is caused by encysted larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. This CNS infection typically occurs through the consumption of food or water contaminated with human feces containing Taenia eggs or via the ingestion of undercooked pork. It can affect the brain parenchyma, subarachnoid space and ventricles. Clinically, it presents with seizures and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (headache, nausea, vomiting, vision changes), dizziness, ataxia, confusion or signs of meningeal irritation. Parenchymal neurocysticercosis can be categorised into four stages -vesicular, colloidal vesicular, granular nodular, and nodular calcified. These stages are readily identified on MRI or CT, depending on the lesion's progression. It is characterised by cystic lesions with or without ring enhancement, focal enhancing lesions, nodular calcifications or multilobulated cystic lesions in the subarachnoid space. Viable parasites appear as cystic lesions with a scolex, often visible on MRI, while calcified, non-viable cysts are more effectively identified on CT. Differential diagnoses for ring-enhancing lesions include brain abscess, toxoplasmosis, central nervous system lymphoma, tuberculoma. Other options: Option B: Tuberculomas (parenchymal granulomas) can mostly occur at the junction of white and grey matter. On CT, they appear as small rounded lesions, solid lesions show homogenous enhancement on contrast CT and show ring enhancement when central caseation or liquefaction occurs. MRI brain shows >20mm, conglomerate or lobulated irregular shape, ring-enhancing lesion. Option C: Primary CNS lymphoma is more common in immunocompromised individuals, though its incidence in HIV patients has decreased with anti-retroviral therapy. Imaging typically shows single or multiple lesions with contrast enhancement, which is uniform in immunocompetent patients and ring-like those who are immunosupressed. Notably, EBV-associated cases in immunocompetent individuals may show rim enhancement. Option D: Brain abscess typically presents as a triad of fever, focal neurological deficits and signs of raised intracranial pressure. It is usually seen with a predisposing condition such as cyanotic heart disease, infected sinuses, middle ear or tooth infection, bacterial meningitis and immunodeficiencies. Common causative organisms include streptococci, gram-negative anaerobic bacilli, enterobacteriaceae, and staphylococcus aureus.

Alexander disease is a type of dysmyelinating disease that typically progresses posteriorly to involve the parietal white matter and internal and external capsules, often accompanied by the formation of cysts. Dysmyelinating diseases, or leukodystrophies, are inherited neurodegenerative disorders that affect the integrity of myelin in the brain and peripheral nerves. Other examples of dysmyelinating diseases include: Metachromatic leukodystrophy: Late infantile (most common), juvenile, and adult types. Symmetric confluent areas of T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular white matter. Radiating T2-hypointense lines through the demyelinated deep white matter represent the sparing of the perivascular white matter. This results in the tigroid and leopard skin patterns when imaged in the long axis or cross-section, respectively. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy: Affects the white matter of the central nervous system, adrenal ortex, and testes.

Contrast-enhanced CT and PET can be used to assess distant metastasis. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the investigation of choice to assess tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis. Other options: Option B: Diffuse esophageal spasm results in the corkscrew appearance of the esophagus on barium study. Option C: Esophageal leiomyoma appears as a smooth, semilunar filling defect on barium swallow. it is seen as a discrete ovoid mass that is well outlined by barium. Option D: Esophageal webs occur in the upper and middle esophagus as a thin membrane that can be identified by the translucent part on contrast radiology.",

It commonly affects middle-aged women with long-standing anaemia, and is a recognized risk factor for post-cricoid hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. It consists of dysphagia, iron-deficiency anemia and esophageal webs or hypopharyngeal webs. Esophageal webs are due to a constriction caused by a thin mucosal membrane projecting into the lumen. More commonly, they are seen in the cervical esophagus near the cricopharyngeus muscle. They typically arise from the anterior wall, but never from the posterior wall.

        "explanation": "The mucosal ring at the squamocolumnar junction of the distal esophagus is a B-ring. Distal esophageal rings are frequent findings on barium contrast X-ray studies. They are of two types: B-ring - It occurs at the squamocolumnar junction or gastroesophageal junction. It is lined with squamous epithelium above and columnar epithelium below. A-ring - It occurs above the B-ring, i.e., a few centimetres proximal to the gastroesophagea junction. It represents a physiological contraction of esophageal smooth muscle covered by mucosa. A-rings are usually asymptomatic (option B). Schatzki ring, also called Schatzki-Gary ring, is a symptomatic narrow B-ring occurring in the distal esophagus. It is usually associated with a hiatus hernia. The below image is a barium study showing the Schatzki ring located at the gastroesophageal junction, suggestive of hiatus hernia. Other options: Option C: Esophageal webs are most common in the upper oesophagus (post-cricoid area), where they are generally semi-circumferential, eccentric lesions that protrude less than 5 mm and have a thickness of 2 to 4 mm. Microscopically, webs are composed of fibrovascular connective tissue and overlying epithelium. The barium swallow below shows the oesophagal web in a patient with Plummer-Vinson syndrome. Oesophagal webs are thin membranes of normal oesophagal tissue consisting of mucosa and submucosa. The translucent part denotes the oesophagal web. Option D: Esophageal stricture refers to any persistent intrinsic narrowing of the esophagus. The causes are peptic stricture (esophagitis induced), corrosives (most common cause), foreign body, post-surgical, radiotherapy, congenital, tuberculosis, and drugs like tetracycline. Radiographic features of benign strictures show smooth tapering with typical concentric narrowing (may affect only one side of the esophagus) while malignant strictures are characteristically abrupt, asymmetric, and eccentric with irregular nodular mucosa. The barium study image below shows esophageal stricture.",

The pouch is best identified during swallowing and is best visualized on the lateral view. Since a majority of patients with a Zenker's diverticulum have a hiatal hernia and gastro-oesophageal reflux, the distal esophagus should also be evaluated.

In endoluminal ultrasonography, the transducer is usually attached to the tip of the instrument distally, and five layers of the gastric wall may be identified, helping in assessing the depth of invasion (T component of the staging) of cancer with more than 90% accuracy. Pre-operative staging is done with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdominal/pelvis. The most important prognostic indicators in gastric cancer are - lymph node involvement and depth of tumor invasion. Endoluminal ultrasound and laparoscopic ultrasound are the most sensitive methods in pre-operative local staging of gastric cancer. Other options: Option A: Standard abdominal ultrasound can be used to investigate the stomach, but it is less sensitive than other modalities in gastric cancer. Option B: Barium meal radiology is now used less frequently due to advances in more sensitive diagnostic tools like endoscopy and CT imaging with oral contrast, replacing contrast radiology in investigating gastric malignancies. However, CT remains less accurate in the T-staging of gastric cancer compared to endoluminal ultrasound. Option D: Laparoscopy is routine in the assessment of gastric cancer. However, the main limitation is in the evaluation of posterior extension, where CT and endoluminal ultrasound can provide this information.",

It is often associated with trisomy 21/Down syndrome, prematurity, maternal polyhydramnios, cardiac malformations, and malformations of the hepatobiliary system. The range of anatomic variants includes duodenal stenosis, mucosal web with intact muscle wall (so-called windsock deformity), two ends separated by a fibrous cord, and complete separation with a gap within the duodenum. On abdominal X-ray, the double bubble sign represents the dilatation of the stomach and proximal duodenum. This can often be detected prenatally via ultrasound but, if missed, neonates typically present with bilious vomiting shortly after birth, as the obstruction is usually distal to the ampulla of Vater. Causes of double bubble sign are congenital obstruction - duodenal atresia (associated with Down syndrome), midgut volvulus, and external compression of the duodenum.

To differentiate Chilaiditi syndrome from true pneumoperitoneum, a contrast-enhanced CT or a left lateral decubitus radiograph can be performed. In the left lateral decubitus view, distended colonic loops with haustral markings will be visible, showing that the air is within the bowel and not in the peritoneal cavity. Other conditions with the Chilaiditi sign are curvilinear pulmonary collapse, distended viscus, omental fat, and apposition of gas-distended bowel loops mimicking the double-wall sign. Below is the chest X-ray and CT showing the presence of herniated bowel loops under the diaphragm. Other options: Option A: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows free intraperitoneal gas which is suggestive of pneumoperitoneum. The presence of free intra-abdominal gas almost always indicates perforation of a hollow viscus. Free intraperitoneal gas is also detectable under the hemidiaphragm on an erect chest X-ray as given below. Option B: The existence of extraluminal gas within the mediastinum is referred to as pneumomediastinum. Gas may originate from the peritoneal cavity, lungs, trachea, central bronchi, oesophagus, or peritoneal cavity and travel to the neck or abdomen via the mediastinum. Spinnaker sign (also called angel wing sign) is a radiographic sign seen in neonates with pneumomediastinum. The pressure from the collected gas displaces the two lobes of the thymic tissue upward and laterally from its normal position. This results in large, wedge-shaped opacities on radiograph resembling the spinnaker headsails of a boat. Other signs of pneumomediastinum are the V sign of Naclerio and continuous diaphragm sign. Below is a chest X-ray showing spinnaker sign and CT showing the presence of pneumomediastinum.",

Single-contrast studies: Only a positive contrast like barium or gastrografin is used. This study can be used to evaluate mechanical problems such as an obstruction or fistula. In suspected perforation, a single contrast with a water-soluble medium is preferred. The advantages of single-contrast studies include precise control of barium column, easier identification of filling defects, and suitability for patients unable to swallow gas-forming tablets. Double-contrast studies: These studies use positive and negative contrast agents to increase the sensitivity of the examination. In these studies, thick barium coats the lumen, and effervescent tablets ingested distend the lumen with air. Positive contrast: Barium or barium-like agents e.g., gastrografin Negative contrast: Air or CO2 The advantages of the double-contrast studies include the \"see-through\" effect, which provides enhanced visualization of mucosal details and increased sensitivity for detecting mucosal irregularities. These studies also allow for better distention and separation of the bowel loops and also better detection of small mucosal lesions, polyps, and ulcers.

A plain radiograph may show a meniscus sign, i.e. soft tissue mass contrasting the bowel that is air-filled. The target sign of intestinal intussusception, also known as the doughnut sign or bull's eye sign, is a diagnostic feature observed on abdominal ultrasound. This appearance is due to concentric alternating echogenic and hypoechogenic bands. The echogenic bands are formed by the mucosa and muscularis, and the hypoechoic bands are formed by the submucosa. Other ultrasound signs of intussusception include: Pseudokidney sign - This is seen in the longitudinal section of the bowel.

The more severe form of CDI is known as pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). Toxigenic Clostridium difficile produces toxin A (an enterotoxin) and toxin B (a cytotoxin), damaging the epithelial-cell barrier function and causing diarrhea and pseudomembrane formation, which initially appear as small whitish-yellow plaques and later coalesce to involve the entire colon wall. The patient also presents with fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis. On CT imaging, accordion sign, also referred to as concertina sign, may be seen. The terms accordion or concertina refer to a harmonica like a musical instrument. The thickened edematous bowel resembles the folds of an accordion. The hyperemic-enhancing mucosa stretched over the thickened submucosal folds produces this appearance.

Most colon cancers occur in the left colon. The clinical features of colon carcinoma include a change in bowel habits or rectal bleeding in cases of left-sided colon tumors and iron deficiency anemia or a mass in proximal lesions of the colon. Colonoscopy is the investigation of choice in suspected colorectal carcinoma. Double-contrast barium enema shows a constant irregular filling defect known as the apple core appearance. Computed tomography (CT) virtual colonoscopy has replaced barium enema as it is highly sensitive. Spiral CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis is now the standard means for staging colon cancer.

The most important sign on barium enema is a sudden change of calibre from the narrow aganglionic segment and dilated proximal bowel. Hirschsprung disease is characterized by aganglionosis (absence of ganglion cells) in the distal colon and rectum. This may occur due to the failure of neuroblasts in neural crest cells to migrate into bowel segments or the degeneration of already migrated neuroblasts. Hence, functional obstruction develops as a result of a spasm in the denervated colon. Clinical features typically include failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life, abdominal distension, vomiting, and constipation. Hirschsprung disease may present with enterocolitis, a severe complication that can be life-threatening. There is a notable association between Hirschsprung disease and Down's syndrome. Water-soluble contrast enema is the initial investigation and diagnostic test of choice. It shows a narrow aganglionic segment, a conical transition zone, and a dilated proximal bowel.

This malformation allows the abdominal organs to push into the chest cavity, impairing lung development and function. The most common type of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia, which usually involves the left side. Mortality is predominantly due to the development of pulmonary hypoplasia. Chest X-ray findings in congenital diaphragmatic hernia include: Bowel loops in the thorax Indistinct diaphragm with opacification of part of or all the hemithorax (typically left-sided) Deviation of lines such as the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, umbilical arterial and venous catheters.

These fissures appear dark on CT or radiographs, giving the sign its characteristic appearance. Gallbladder stones or cholelithiasis are the most common condition affecting the gallbladder. They are often discovered incidentally and typically remain asymptomatic. However, they become symptomatic when the stones obstruct the cystic duct. In such cases, patients may experience dull or colicky right upper quadrant or epigastric pain radiating to the back, along with symptoms like nausea and vomiting. Only about 10% of gallstones are radiopaque. Ultrasonography (USG) is the most accurate initial imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of gallbladder stones.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas arise most commonly in the head of the gland. Pancreatic carcinoma presents with varied symptoms, commonly including weight loss and anorexia, which may or may not be accompanied by abdominal pain. Tumours in the pancreatic head often cause early bile duct obstruction, leading to jaundice. Frostberg's inverted 3 sign is a sign seen on a barium examination. There is effacement and distortion of the mucosal pattern on the medial wall of the second part of the duodenum due to focal mass and local edema. It is associated with carcinoma of the head of the pancreas, duodenal carcinoma and pancreatitis (widening of the C loop of the duodenum). Antral pad sign may also be seen in barium studies in patients with carcinoma head of the pancreas. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram shows a characteristic 'gloved finger' obstruction of the intrapancreatic common bile duct, which is pathognomonic for carcinoma of the pancreatic head.

A splenic rupture may not always be clinically apparent and spontaneous splenic rupture or pathological rupture can occur after minor trauma or insignificant events. Signs of splenic rupture on plain X-ray are obliteration of splenic outline, loss of psoas shadow, elevation of left hemidiaphragm and fracture of lower ribs on left side.

Horseshoe kidney results from the fusion of two functional kidneys located on either side of the midline, typically connected by an isthmus composed of either functional renal parenchyma or fibrous tissue. In most cases, the fusion occurs at lower poles. The ascent of the horseshoe kidney is halted by the inferior mesenteric artery, which prevents it from reaching the normal level of T12- L3. Consequently, the kidney remains lower in the abdomen, making it more susceptible to complications such as reflux, obstruction, and stone formation. The following image shows horseshoe kidneys on abdominal CT: Note: When both upper and lower poles are fused, it is termed a discoid kidney.",

MCDK is a form of renal dysplasia characterized by multiple, non-communicating cysts of varying sizes, separated by dysplastic parenchyma, with the absence of a normal pelvicalyceal system. It results from a developmental abnormality due to failure of the renal mesenchyme to unite with the ureteric bud. This condition is associated with ureteral or ureteropelvic atresia, and the affected kidney is non-functional. Most cases of MCDK are detected antenatally through ultrasonography. In some cases, the cysts identified prenatally may regress in utero, resulting in the affected kidney being undetectable on imaging at birth. Renal ultrasonography is the initial investigation of choice. It reveals a soap bubble appearance. Bilateral MCDK can lead to pulmonary hypoplasia and Potter syndrome. The following image shows a non-visualized right kidney (red arrow). Other options: Option A: In the duplicated collecting system, the drooping lily sign is seen. It refers to the inferolateral displacement of the opacified lower pole moiety due to an obstructed (and un-opacified) upper pole moiety.

The duplicated collecting system is a common congenital anomaly of the urinary tract characterized by an incomplete fusion of upper and lower pole moieties resulting in a variety of complete or incomplete duplications of the collecting system. It occurs due to the division of the ureter as it ascends upwards from the bladder to the renal parenchyma during the embryological period of life. As a result, the affected individual may have two collecting systems for one kidney. Duplex collecting systems may also be complicated by vesicoureteric reflux, obstruction or ureterocoele. When the upper pole ureter is obstructed, the lower pole collecting system appears displaced and stretched on imaging, creating the \"drooping lily\" sign observed in intravenous urography. The Weigert-Meyer law describes the relationship of the upper and lower renal moieties in duplicated collecting systems to their drainage. When there are abnormalities associated with duplicating collecting systems, The upper pole moiety drains inferomedially and is most commonly associated with obstruction. The lower pole moiety drains superolaterally and is most commonly associated with vesicoureteral reflux. The illustration given below shows the Weigert-Meyer law.",

It predominantly affects diabetic patients who are particularly susceptible due to their hyperglycemic state, which promotes bacterial growth and fermentation.

Less commonly, organisms like Klebsiella and Proteus species can also cause this condition. Almost all patients present with fever, vomiting and flank pain. Patients frequently present with sepsis and ketoacidosis. If not treated early, it may lead to fulminant sepsis and is associated with high mortality.

It is more common in males and typically presents with symptoms such as increased urinary frequency, polyuria, dysuria, hematuria, loin pain/suprapubic pain and sterile pyuria. In sterile pyuria, urine appears pale and opalescent due to the presence of pus cells. Renal TB is a cause of sterile pyuria.

It can affect the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymis, and vas deferens. Lesions caused by tuberculosis in the kidney include: Papillary ulcer - earliest lesion Pyonephrosis - caused by multiple scattered papillary ulcers undergoing caseous necrosis, which later become filled with pus Perinephric abscess - by extension of pyonephrosis or tuberculous renal abscess Pseudocalculi - occurs when calcium gets deposited in a papillary ulcer healed with fibrosis Ghost calyces - caused by the destruction of the calyces Putty/cement kidney - amorphous dystrophic calcification eventually involves the entire kidney (seen in X-ray and CT) Ureteric lesions seen in genitourinary tuberculosis include Kerr’s kink (kinking of the ureteropelvic junction), stricture, beaded ureter, and shortening of the ureter.

The investigation of choice in this condition is a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) or micturating cystourethrogram (MCU). VUR refers to an abnormal urine flow from the bladder to the ureters and occurs in young children. This reflux predisposes to pyelonephritis by allowing the entry of bacteria into the usually sterile upper tract. As such, the diagnosis is first suspected after a UTI in a very young child or recurrent UTIs. USG may reveal abnormalities like hydronephrosis and dilated ureters. VCUG must be performed in such children before the age of 6 years to look for: Presence and grade of VUR. Whether reflux occurs during micturition or bladder filling. Presence of associated anatomical anomalies. The grading of VUR is based on the height of reflux up the ureters and the degree of dilatation of the ureters, as shown below, followed by an MCU showing grade V VUR on the left side. Other options: Option B: A 99mTc-DTPA scan is used to measure GFR as it is cleared by glomerular filtration and no tubular reabsorption, determine differential renal function and evaluate for the presence of degree of renal function.

Its uptake reflects the tubular function. Option D: The 99mTc-DMSA scan is used for the assessment of the renal cortex as it binds to the sulfhydryl groups in proximal tubules with longer retention than other agents. It allows for a better assessment of differential renal function. It is used for the evaluation of the renal structure and morphology, detection of renal scarring in reflux nephropathy and pyelonephritis and evaluation of renal anatomical abnormalities.",

The investigation of choice to evaluate for renal scarring in reflux nephropathy is the Tc-99m DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) scan. It is used in renal imaging to evaluate renal structure and morphology, particularly in paediatric imaging for the detection of scarring and pyelonephritis. DMSA is an ideal agent for the assessment of the renal cortex as it binds within the proximal tubules of the cortex with longer retention than other agents. It allows a better assessment of differential renal function. It is a static scan as opposed to dynamic DTPA or MAG3 scans. Other common renal scans include: Tc-99m DTPA (diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate) - used for direct measurement of GFR as it is cleared only via glomeruli with no tubular excretion (option B). Tc-99m MAG3 (mercaptoacetyltriglycine) - excreted through the renal route via both glomeruli infiltration and tubular excretion. Hence, in pediatric patients and patients with poor renal function, this test is considered superior to a DTPA scan. (option C). In renovascular hypertension, captopril DTPA is used for screening and the gold standard investigation is renal angiography.

Angiomyolipomas (AMLs) are benign tumours that occur sporadically or in association with tuberous sclerosis. It is commonly seen in adults between 30 and 50 years of age, with a female predilection. AMLs predominantly affect the kidneys, though they can occur in other sites such as the liver (a common extra-renal location) and less frequently in the ovary, fallopian tube, spermatic cord, palate, and colon. Histologically, angiomyolipomas consist of perivascular epitheloid cells with varying proportions of vascular, immature smooth muscle cells, and fat cells. Patients with AMLs present with flank pain, a palpable mass, hematuria, recurrent urinary tract infections, hypertension, or renal failure. Larger tumours increase the risk of complications, such as spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which can manifest as sudden-onset abdominal or flank pain, along with symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. Everolimus is used for the treatment of angiomyolipomas. Treatment should be considered for asymptomatic, growing AMLs measuring >3 cm in diameter. Angiomyolipomas do not normally require surgery unless life-threatening bleeding is present. Other options: Renal cyst is a broader term that includes the cystic lesions of the kidney. They can be simple cysts that are benign. Complex or complicated cystic lesions need evaluation and can be malignant. Bosniak classification is used for renal cysts.

CT image showing a simple renal cyst: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common malignant tumour of the kidney. It usually occurs in the age group 50-70 years and macroscopic hematuria is seen in about 60% of the cases.

        "explanation": "This clinical scenario of sudden scrotal pain while playing is suspicious for testicular torsion. The investigation of choice is doppler ultrasonography. It indicates reduced or absent blood flow to the testes. In testicular torsion, the blood supply to the testicle is compromised due to the twisting of the spermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis due to a 'bell clapper deformity', resulting in ischemia of the epididymis and the testis. It is typically seen in adolescence and usually presents with sudden onset pain and swelling of the scrotum, associated with vomiting. A high-riding, swollen, and tender testis with a tender twisted cord can often be palpated above it, along with an erythematous scrotum and absent cremastric reflex on the affected side. A Doppler ultrasound may be taken to assess the blood supply but surgical exploration is still indicated as a clinical decision. Doppler ultrasound scanning shows absent or decreased intratesticular arterial blood flow compared to the contralateral testis. Doppler studies have improved the ultrasonographic evaluation of testicular torsion with the presence of whirlpool sign within the spermatic cord, which represents the twisted cord and is analogous to the twisted ovarian pedicle seen in ovarian torsion. Urgent scrotal exploration is indicated if there is doubt regarding the diagnosis. A transverse scrotal incision is taken and if the testis is viable twisting again is prevented by fixation with three non-absorbable sutures between the tunica albuginea of the testis and the scrotal raphe.",

        "explanation": "Bilateral pedal edema in an elderly patient with left-sided renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is suspicious for tumor extension into the left renal vein and IVC. The investigation of choice to assess the vascular extension of the tumor thrombus is Magnetic resonance imaging. RCC is the most common malignant tumor of the kidney that usually presents in the elderly. Cigarette smoking and hypertension are major associated risk factors. The classic triad of presentation is with flank pain, macroscopic haematuria, and a palpable flank mass. Advanced cases can also present with bilateral lower limb edema. MRI is beneficial for assessing vascular invasion, especially when evaluating the renal vein and IVC. It aids in differentiating between benign and malignant thrombus. However, it does not provide a significant advantage over CT in staging nodal disease. Other options: Option C: Triphasic contrast-enhanced CT is the investigation of choice for diagnosis and staging of RCC (image given below). On CT, small lesions enhance homogeneously, whereas larger lesions have irregular enhancement due to areas of necrosis. The CT also provides additional information on the function of the opposite kidney, primary tumor extension, venous involvement, enlargement of regional lymph nodes, the status of the adrenal glands, and intra-abdominal metastatic disease. Option A: Intravenous urography is no longer suitable for detecting renal masses, particularly if they occur centrally; cross-sectional imaging studies are more appropriate for investigating suspected renal mass. Option D: FDG-Positron Emission Tomography plays a limited role in the initial detection and diagnosis of RCC due to low fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by these tumours. However, it can be useful in identifying local recurrence and serves as a complementary tool alongside other cross-sectional imaging methods.",

        "explanation": "This clinical scenario is suggestive of renal calculi. The investigation of choice is non-contrast CT (NCCT). NCCT is useful as it has a greater sensitivity to tissue attenuation and, hence, can pick up stones that may appear radiolucent on plain X-rays. Renal calculi are more common in males, with 90% of stones being radiopaque. Clinically, patients present with severe pain located over the renal angle, often radiating to the groin. The pain may be accompanied by vomiting due to pyloric spasm, as well as hematuria, nausea, fever, and in some cases, symptoms of pyuria. A non-contrast CT scan is the imaging modality of choice for suspected urinary tract calculi. It is the most sensitive and gold-standard test for detecting stones as it is quick, detects most types of calculi, and can be performed with low radiation doses. A history of nephrolithiasis with new-onset flank pain should prompt immediate evaluation with non-contrast CT. The radiographic features depend on the stone composition. The following types of renal calculi may appear radiolucent on plain X-ray: Uric acid, Indinavir and pure matrix stones (may have radiodense rim or centre). On CT, most stones are usually opaque. However, indinavir and pure matrix stones appear radiolucent even on CT. The following X-ray KUB image shows a staghorn calculus (struvite).",

Retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF) is a chronic, nonspecific inflammatory process of the fibro-fatty tissue in the retroperitoneum, with the idiopathic type being the most common, accounting for about 70% of the cases. Patients typically present with persistent flank pain or back pain. Progressive fibrotic thickening can compress the ureters, leading to bilateral hydronephrosis and, if untreated, renal failure. Aside from idiopathic causes, other causes of RPF include drug-induced factors ( e.g., methysergide, beta-blockers), advanced malignancy, radiation exposure, trauma, and chronic infections. Diagnosis of RPF relies primarily on imaging studies. Intravenous urography shows a characteristic triad of medial deviation of the middle one-third of the ureters, producing a maiden waist sign, hydroureteronephrosis, and extrinsic compression of the ureters by the fibrotic process. CT and MRI are also useful in radiographic evaluation of RPF.",

These signs refer to a dilated, contrast-filled distal ureter surrounded by a thin rim of the ureteric wall and bladder mucosa. Ureterocoele is a cystic enlargement of the intramural portion of the ureter, more commonly seen in females than males. It is thought to be caused due to ureteric orifice atresia. They are similar to ectopic ureters, which typically drain the upper pole of the kidney and are associated with dysplastic or non-functional renal tissue. If they present clinically, ureteroceles often manifest with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children, while in adults, they are more likely to present with stones in the lower ureter. Ureterocoeles can enlarge and obstruct the bladder neck or the contralateral ureteric orifice. The classic sign of a ureterocele on intravenous urography is a ‘cobra head’, ‘adder head’, or 'spring onion sign'. On ultrasonography, it can be seen as a fluid-filled cystic mass in the bladder. The treatment of simple ureteroceles is surgical excision with re-implantation of the ureter. OBG radiology",

The patient presents with a characteristic history of abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding or spotting, and vomiting during the first trimester. Also, there may be a history of passing grape-like vesicles vaginally. The snowstorm appearance on USG, combined with a raised hCG and a uterus larger than the date of pregnancy, leads to the diagnosis of a complete hydatidiform mole. Suction and evacuation is the treatment of choice. Serum hCG levels are checked within 48 hours of evacuation and are used as a baseline for future comparisons. It is then checked every week until it normalizes, which usually takes 4 to 8 weeks. After the hCG values return to normal, a regular follow-up is done monthly for 6 months.",

Screening for anencephaly reveals increased levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP). Diagnosis is confirmed by sonography. The following are the radiological signs seen in anencephaly: Frog eye sign - Absence of cranial calvaria, causing prominent orbits, thereby resembling the face of a frog. Shower cap sign - The absence of the cranium could lead to the protrusion of a disorganize mass of brain tissue.

        "explanation": "The given image shows the lemon sign, which is seen in spina bifida. Spina bifida is the common open neural tube defect associated with hydrocephalus and Arnold-Chiari II malformation. It is the most common open neural tube disorder. Spina bifida is characterized by a cleft in the vertebral column with a corresponding defect in the skin so that the meninges and spinal cord are exposed. The 3 main types of spina bifida: Spina bifida occulta - This is the mildest form of spina bifida. The defect in the vertebral arches is covered by the skin. The splits in the vertebrae are so small that the spinal cord does not protrude. The skin at the site of the lesion may be normal, or it may have some hair growing from it. Meningocele - The defect in the vertebra allows the meninges to protrude through the defect. Myelomeningocele (meningomyelocele) - A defect in the vertebral column allows the spinal cor with the meningeal coverings to protrude. The lemon sign is related to changes in the configuration of the fetal frontal bone, which loses convexity and appears concave or linear on ultrasonography; this sign can be detected during the first six months of gestation. The banana sign is another sign that is seen in spina bifida associated with Arnold-Chiari II malformation. Herniation of the brainstem and cerebellar tonsils occurs through the foramen magnum, with the cerebellum surrounding the brainstem, thus giving rise to the appearance of the curved shape of a banana. Other options: Option B: Anencephaly is characterized by an open defect in the calvaria and skin, such that the cranial neural tube is exposed. It is a severe defect and is not compatible with survival. Frog eye sign is seen in USG. Prominent orbits (arrows) and an absence of cerebral tissue more cranially are seen. Option C: Holoprosencephaly is a rare congenital brain malformation resulting from incomplete separation of the two hemispheres. On antenatal ultrasound, there may be also evidence of polyhydramnios, and the snake-under-the-skull sign may also be seen. Option D: Omphalocele is a midline anterior abdominal wall defect through which the soli abdominal viscera and/or bowel may herniate. The extruded abdominal contents are covered in a sac. Given below is a fetal ultrasound image suggestive of an omphalocele (asterisk). Radiotherapy",

        "explanation": "The Bragg peak effect is pronounced in protons. The proton is a heavy and charged particle that gradually loses its speed as it interacts with human tissue. It is easily controlled and delivers its maximum dose at a precise depth and can go as far as 32 cm. The absorbed dose increases very gradually with greater depth and lower speed, suddenly rising to a peak when the proton is ultimately stopped. This is known as the Bragg peak. The behavior of the proton can be precisely determined, and the beam can be directed, allowing the Bragg peak to occur within the tumor site. Immediately following this burst of energy, the protons cease radiating and come to a complete stop. This property of proton therapy enables targeting tumors within the body, delivering radiation directly to the tumor while sparing the surrounding healthy cells, offering a much less invasive alternative to treat cancer. The Bragg curve shown below plots the energy loss of ionizing radiation during its travel through matter.",

An additional wrist badge has to be worn for procedures requiring hands close to the primary beam. The thermoluminescent material used is calcium sulfate doped with dysprosium or lithium fluoride. Radiation exposure is monitored every three months. The maximum dose limit for occupational radiation workers is 30 mSv in a year, provided the cumulative dose in a block of 5 years does not exceed 100 mSv. The given image shows a TLD badge.",

        "explanation": "PET or positron emission tomography is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that can be used for hybrid imaging. That is, it can be combined with CT to allow a correlation between the metabolic information (PET) and the cross-sectional anatomic information (CT). PET scanning measures the uptake of positron-emitting radioisotopes in the body, allowing us to visualize the functional processes of the body. 3D images of tracer concentration within the body are then constructed by computer analysis. Hence, it provides metabolic and functional information, unlike CT and MRI, as it is based on the principle that tumor cells generally have high metabolic activity compared with normal tissues. A glucose analogue called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is used in PET imaging. FDG is taken up by metabolically active cells, where it undergoes phosphorylation to form FDG-6-phosphate. Unlike glucose, FDG-6-phosphate cannot undergo further metabolism and becomes trapped within the cell and this is detected by the PET scanner. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is another similar imaging technique. The below imaging modality is a PET CT scan. PET SPECT Very expensive Lower cost Usespositron-emitting radioi sotope (tracer) like18F-FDG Usesgamma-emitting radiois otopes (tracer) such asTc-99 m,I-123, I-131 Better contrast and spatial re solution Less contrast and spatial reso lution",

        "explanation": "Picture archiving and communication system (PACS) is a modality of imaging technology that helps in image transmission from the site of acquisition of images, to multiple different sites at different locations. This is not only economical (film-less department), but is also convenient to access multiple modalities (radiographs, CT, MRI, ultrasound) simultaneously at multiple locations within the hospital or across the globe. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is a standard for handling, storing, printing, and transmitting information in medical imaging. DICOM is used worldwide to store, exchange, and transmit medical images.",

        "explanation": "The given image shows low radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) suggestive of subacute thyroiditis. High RAIU is caused due to Graves' disease, endemic iodine deficiency, and HCG-induced thyrotoxicosis. In non-pregnant, hyperthyroid patients with physical examination suggesting nodular thyroid disease, radioactive iodine should be the initial test to determine the etiology. Pregnancy and breastfeeding are absolute contraindications to radionuclide imaging.",
