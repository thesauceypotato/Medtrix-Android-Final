Very little heparin is needed in the sample to prevent clotting; 0.05 to 0.10 ml of a dilute solution will help prevent coagulation of 1 ml of blood without affecting its pH. This is achieved by drawing 0.5 ml into the syringe and flushing it out. The residue that remains adherent to the syringe is sufficient for the procedure. Heparin must be added to the syringe as an anticoagulant. Because the pH of heparin is near 7.0, and the Po2 and Pco2 of the heparin solution are near room air values, excess heparin can alter ABG measurements. After flushing the syringe with heparin, a sufficient amount usually remains in the dead space of the syringe and needle for anticoagulation without distortion of the ABG determination.

Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a supraglottic airway device that is positioned in the hypopharynx. Classic Laryngeal Mask Airway Supraglottic airway devices are used with both spontaneously and ventilated patients during anesthesia. LMA has advantages of being used in many settings, including the operating room (alternate route of ventilation), the emergency department (difficult intubation), and out-of-hospital care (paramedics). This is because it is easy to use, quick to place even for the inexperienced provider and has a very high success rate. The technique of insertion: The deflated cuff of LMA is lubricated and inserted blindly into the hypopharynx so that, once nflated, the cuff forms a low-pressure seal around the entrance to the larynx. Correct placement of the tube is confirmed by giving gentle positive pressure ventilation while checking for chest rise and ETCO2 using capnography. Note: Oropharyngeal airway: inserted in the patient’s mouth with concavity towards hard palate. As the airway is inserted it is rotated 180&deg; (concavity towards the tongue) until the flange comes to rest on the patient’s lips. Nasopharyngeal airway: inserted through the nostril (after lubrication) along the natural curvature of the floor of the nasal cavity with the bevel pointing towards the septum. Once the device is inserted the flange should rest on the nostril opening. Endotracheal tube: inserted infraglottically after visualising the vocal cords with direct laryngoscopy.",

Succinylcholine is usually the muscle relaxant of choice for RSI since it has a rapid onset and short duration of action. However, regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents are likely, due to fasciculations of the abdominal skeletal muscles. Hence, endotracheal intubation may be facilitated with rocuronium before succinylcholine to decrease this risk. Generally, an IGP > 28 cm H2O is required to overcome the competence of the gastroesophageal junction. However, when the normal oblique angle of entry of the esophagus into the stomach is altered, the IGP required for regurgitation is much lesser. Conditions that predispose to raised IGP are: Pregnancy Ascite Bowel obstruction Hiatus hernia",

After which the pressure falls until the cylinder is exhausted. N2O pressure gauge reading at full, half, one-fourth, and empty cylinder. The contents of N2O cylinders can be accurately measured by weighing the cylinders rather than by pressure gauge. To measure the content, the weight of an empty cylinder, known as Tare weight is subtracted from the actual weight of the cylinder. O2 pressure gauge reading at full, half, one-fourth and empty cylinder. In a cylinder containing a non-liquefied gas such as Oxygen, the pressure in the cylinder decreases as the contents are used. Therefore the pressure gauge can be used to measure the cylinder content. Oxygen pressure gauge would read 2200, 1100, and 550 PSI at 100%, 50%, and 25% content respectively.",

The natural humidification and conservation of heat by the upper respiratory tract is lost or bypassed after tracheal intubation or tracheostomy. HME acts as an artificial nose, which traps the exhaled water vapor and heat passively by its hygroscopic material, and thus conserves heat and adds moisture to the inhaled gases. Active humidifiers act by allowing air passage inside a heated water reservoir. These devices are placed in the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit, proximal to the ventilator. After the air is loaded with water vapor in the reservoir, it travels along the inspiratory limb to the patient’s airway. Some humidifiers also serve as filters to trap bacteria/viruses and thus prevent the transmission of microbes from the patient to the machine and hence to other patients. The disadvantage with the humidifier is that excess saturation can lead to blockage of the circuit. Shown above is an HME filter impregnated with a hygroscopic material.

Basic life support refers to the emergency management of sudden cardiac arrest, heart attack, stroke, and foreign body airway obstruction, usually without the use of equipment other than automated external defibrillators. The CPR sequence is as follows - circulation (chest compression), airway, and then breathing: Circulation: Chest compressions lead to ejection of blood from the heart, as a result of actual compression of the heart between the sternum and vertebral column. Airway: Head tilt, chin lift, and jaw thrust maneuvers are used to open the airway. Breathing: If there is no adequate breathing even after opening the airway, the rescuer should initiate assisted ventilation by giving rescue breaths to the patient using mouth-to-mouth, mouth-to-nose, mouth-to-stoma, mouth-to-barrier device, mouth-to-face shield, or mouth-to-mask rescue breathing or by using a bag-mask device. Defibrillation: Using automated external defibrillators (AED)",

        "explanation": "The patient is in atrial fibrillation but his hemodynamic status is normal. So the treatment of choice is IV Ibutilide. Ibutilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that has a rapid onset of action. It restores sinus rhythm by prolonging the action potential duration and effective refractory period. It is administered at a dose of 1 mg over 10 minutes. If necessary, a second dose can be administered 10 minutes after the first. If there is evidence of hemodynamic deterioration, immediate cardioversion is the treatment of choice. Cardioversion is a synchronized administration of shock as the timing is typically synchronized with the R waves or QRS complex of a cardiac cycle. On the other hand, random administration of shock anywhere in between a cardiac cycle is termed as Defibrillation which is non-synchronized. However, the mechanism for both processes is quite similar. The electric current is made to travel from the negative to the positive electrode in such a way that it traverses the entire myocardium at once to conduct a simultaneous contraction of each cell of the heart muscle. It is made to interrupt any ongoing abnormal electrical activity by terminating it so that the sinus node can take back the charge and resume its normal pacemaker activity. Cardioversion is typically performed under induction or sedation using a short-acting agent such as midazolam, unless the patient is hemodynamically unstable or if cardiovascular collapse is imminent. Defibrillation is more of an emergent maneuver and, when necessary, should be preferably performed in conjunction with or prior to the administration of induction or sedative agents. Energy may be delivered through mainly two waveforms in defibrillators that are monophasic or biphasic. Monophasic defibrillation delivers a charge in only one direction as opposed to biphasic defibrillation delivering a charge in one direction for half of the shock and in the electrically opposite direction for the second half. Biphasic waveforms are adopted in newer defibrillators as they deliver a more consistent magnitude of the current which successfully terminates arrhythmias at lower energies than monophasic waveform defibrillators. Energy selection for defibrillation or cardioversion. Following are the guidelines for initial energy requirements issued by the American Heart Association in 2010. Atrial fibrillation energy requirements are as follows: 200 Joules for monophasic devices 120-200 Joules for biphasic devices Atrial flutter energy requirements are as follows: 100 Joules for monophasic devices 50-100 Joules for biphasic devices Ventricular tachycardia with pulse energy requirements are as follows: 200 Joules for monophasic devices 100 Joules for biphasic devices Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia energy requirements are as follows: 360 Joules for monomorphic devices 120-200 Joules for biphasic devices Indications for electrical card ioversion Indications for defibrillation Supraventricular tachycardia( atrioventricular nodal reentr ant tachycardia [AVNRT] and atrioventricular reentrant ta chycardia [AVRT])Atrial fibril lationAtrial flutter(types I an d II)Ventricular tachycardia( with a pulse)Any patient with re-entranttachycardia withna rrow or wide QRScomplex (v entricular rate >150 bpm) wh o isunstable(eg, ischemic che st pain, acute pulmonary ede ma, hypotension, acute altere d mental status, signs of shoc k) Pulseless ventricular tachycar dia (VT)Ventricular fibrillatio n (VF)Cardiac arrestdue to or resulting in VF",

This is because of the greater reduction in cardiac output caused by halothane than the other volatile agents. Hepatic arterial buffer response(HABF) is an autoregulatory mechanism in the liver. When portal blood flow decreases due to decreased cardiac output or hypovolemia, the hepatic arterial blood flow increases in order to maintain total hepatic blood flow.

Hence, this is the best answer to choose from the above options. Option A: Higher anaesthetic levels are achieved in the elderly for a given dosage of spinal anaesthetic.

        "explanation": "To prevent hemodynamic disturbances, we must prevent the migration of the spinal block to upper thoracic segments. In the sitting position, this can be achieved by using a hyperbaric solution like bupivacaine with glucose. Baricity of local anesthetics refers to the specific gravity of the solution with respect to that of CSF. A hyperbaric solution (addition of glucose) of local anesthetic is denser (heavier) than CSF, a hypobaric solution (addition of sterile water or fentanyl) is lighter than CSF and isobaric solution (plain or 1:1 CSF) has density same as that of CSF. Hyperbaric solution tends to move to the dependent area of the spine. While a hypobaric solution moves to the non-dependent area. An isobaric solution remains at the level of injection. With the patient in a head-down position, a hyperbaric solution spreads cephalad, and a hypobaric solution moves caudally. In clinical practice, hyperbaric solutions are most commonly used during spinal anesthesia. A hypobaric solution is only used in prone jackknife position to specifically block the operative site around perineum during certain anorectal surgeries.",

The Apfel score is used to predict the risk of developing postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). According to this, risk factors are: Post-operative use of opioids Non-smoker Female gender History of postoperative nausea, vomiting, or motion sickness Additional risk factors are the use of nitrous oxide as an inhalational anesthetic agent and the duration of anesthesia. Ondansetron with or without dexamethasone is used in the management of this condition. The use of propofol in balanced or total IV anesthesia (TIVA) significantly reduces the incidence of PONV.",

LMWH administration must be stopped prophylactically (12 hours prior) and therapeutically (24 hours prior) to centrineuraxial anaesthesia. It can be done only after checking if the platelet count is normal (if LMWH has been administered for more than 4 days). This is due to reports of spinal/epidural hematomas when centrineuraxial anaesthesia is given to patients on LMWH.",

Most general anaesthetics especially the volatile agents also cause vasodilation and hypotension which can be treated with escalating doses of vasopressors like phenylephrine. Mild to moderate aortic stenosis are not contraindications to regional anaesthesia. In such situations, epidural anaesthesia is preferred over spinal because of its slower onset of hypotension which can be adequately corrected.",

Atracurium or cisatracurium undergo Hofmann elimination which is non-enzymatic spontaneous degradation. Pancuronium is almost entirely dependent on the kidney for excretion (60–90%). Pancuronium has a prolonged elimination half-life in renal failure patients and thus should be used very cautiously. 40-60% of d-tubocurarine is excreted via the kidney and so prolonged effects are seen with rena insufficiency",

Pre-eclampsia patients have a risk of severe airway edema, which makes intubation difficult. Thus continuous epidural anesthesia is advantageous as it avoids the need for intubation. Besides, continuous epidural anesthesia can improve uteroplacental perfusion and also decrease catecholamine secretion. But one major prerequisite for regional anesthesia in preeclamptic patients is normal platelet count and normal coagulation. Coagulopathy is a contraindication for regional anesthesia. Minimal platelet count for regional anesthesia is 100,000/L, but some cases can be taken up with a platelet count as low as 70,000/L. General anesthesia is indicated in patients with coagulopathy and in severe pre-eclampsia with complications. Spinal anesthesia can be given in mild pre-eclampsia but hypotension associated with spinal anesthesia limits its use in moderate to severe pre-eclampsia. Since the severity of pre-eclampsia or the type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean) is not mentioned, epidural anesthesia has an advantage over other techniques for above-mentioned reasons. Hence the best option here would be epidural anesthesia.",

The epidural catheter placed at L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace sufficiently provides T10–S5 neural blockade. Option A: Pudendal nerve block is given in the second stage of labor just before delivery of the baby to provide analgesia to the vulva and anus . However, it has no effect on the pain of contractions. It is also given before repair of episiotomy or perineal lacerations. Option B: Spinal anaesthesia for labour analgesia has the advantage of a rapid and reliable onset of the neural blockade, and it is technically easier to administer compared to epidural analgesia. However, repeated intrathecal injections may be required for a prolonged labour, thus increasing the risk of post-dural puncture headache. Option C: Caudal epidural is largely abandoned to provide pain relief in obstetrics.

But, now it has been discovered that the subglottic region at the level of the cricoid cartilage is the narrowest portion in about 70% of adults. Salient features of pediatric airway: Neonates are obligate nasal breathers (up to 5 months). Nasal passages are narrower. Larger tongue in relation to the oropharynx (airway obstruction and difficult intubation may be a problem). The larynx is placed higher in the neck (the glottis is at a vertebral level of C4 versus C6 in adults), so straight laryngoscope blades are preferred. A short, omega-shaped epiglottis, and a shorter trachea and neck. Vocal cords are angulated and so if a tracheal tube is passed blindly instead of passing into the trachea it could lodge in the anterior commissure.",

Option A: Succinylcholine is used for rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia because of its rapid onset and ultra-short duration of action. It is the shortest acting muscle relaxant but it is not used for routine intubation in children due to its many adverse effects like rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and malignant hyperthermia. Option C: Vecuronium action is prolonged in small children due to immature hepatic and renal function. Option D: Atracurium or cisatracurium may be preferred in young infants, particularly for short procedures, because they undergo Hoffman elimination leading to a short duration of action.

Normally sevoflurane and halothane are agents used for induction in children. But in a child with airway obstruction like croup (laryngotracheobronchitis), rapid induction is contraindicated. To perform laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in such children, slow induction of anaesthesia is required before the child becomes sufficiently anaesthetized. Moreover, halothane has a slower excretion than sevoflurane, which provides sufficient time for airway management. The therapeutic index of sevoflurane is higher than halothane (myocardial depression, sensitization of the myocardium to arrhythmias, halothane hepatitis) and hence is preferred for routine cases. However in certain underdeveloped countries, due to its cost-effectiveness, halothane is preferred.",

Option A: Morphine leads to greater respiratory depression in neonates due to slower clearance of morphine.

For surgical repair in children with pyloric stenosis, either of the following two techniques can be done: Rapid-sequence induction - if suxamethonium (2mg/kg) is used, atropine (0.02 mg/kg) should be given because children are more susceptible than adults to bradycardia and sinus node arrest associated with suxamethonium. Awake intubation - preserves airway reflexes The classically described rapid sequence technique (preoxygenation, cricoid pressure, and avoiding mask ventilation) is not appropriate for an infant with pyloric stenosis. Opton A: Aspiration of gastric contents is done by suctioning with a wide bore vented catheter before induction of anaesthesia to remove 98% of gastric contents. Option B: Cricoid pressure can distort the anatomy making laryngoscopy difficult, hence avoided. If it is applied and there is no clear view of the larynx then the pressure should be relaxed. Option D: Infants rapidly desaturate compared to adults due to greater oxygen consumption and smaller functional residual capacity.

It is preferred as it has a shorter elimination half-life (2 hours) and has the advantage of producing anterograde amnesia. It is water-soluble and hence painless on injection. It is usually administered to children 10 to 12 months or older because of separation anxiety from parents. Other sedative premedications that are sometimes used include dexmedetomidine, clonidine, temazepam and ketamine. Option A: Barbiturates are not commonly used for premedication in children since the availability of short-acting benzodiazepines. A major disadvantage is hyperalgesia, which can induce agitation in children with pain. Option B: Diazepam has a longer elimination half-life (18 hours) and immature liver function that would prolong its action in young children. Option D: Propofol is the most useful sedative-hypnotic drug but is not approved for this use in pediatric patients. Note- Ketamine is effective as a sedative, but it can increase oral secretion and can cause hallucinations during recovery. Hence oral ketamine is usually avoided, and when used, is administered along with antisialogogue (atropine/glycopyrrolate) and a benzodiazepine (such as midazolam).",

The most common cause of nonsurgical bleeding following massive blood transfusion is dilutional thrombocytopenia. Massive transfusion is most often defined as the need to transfuse one to two times the patient’s blood volume. For most adult patients, that is the equivalent of 10–20 units. Major trauma or blood loss will initiate a cascade of coagulation abnormalities, including a consumptive coagulopathy from tissue hypoperfusion as manifested by increased protein C levels. This coagulopathy is caused by a combination of factors, of which the most important are the dilution of coagulation factors by volume administration e.g., crystalloid, colloid, PRBC, and the duration of hypotension and hypoperfusion. Concurrent transfusion of packed red cells, plasma, and platelets can be done to avoid dilutional coagulopathy.",

If the body temperature decreases to less than 30°C, ventricular irritability and cardiac arrest may occur. Shivering from even mild hypothermia increases metabolic demands and is counterproductive to tissue perfusion, especially in settings where anemia or hypoperfusion is contributing to tissue ischemia. Hypothermia together with low levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) in stored blood can cause a marked leftward shift of the hemoglobin–oxygen dissociation curve which can lead to tissue hypoxia. The ideal method of warming blood is to pass it through plastic coils or cassettes in a warm water bath(37°C to 38°C) or warming plates.",
