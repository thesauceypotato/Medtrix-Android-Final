It corresponds to when the fetus weighs 500g or more. This definition is not to be confused with the period used for the calculation of the perinata mortality rate (PMR). To calculate the PMR, a fetal weight above 1000 g is considered, which is achieved at 28 weeks of gestation. Therefore, for all statistical purposes, internationa comparisons, and calculation of perinatal mortality rate, the period from the 28th week of life is considered. Perinatal period: from the 22nd week. Perinatal mortality rate calculation: from the 28th week. The neonatal period is defined as the first 28 days after birth. Infancy is defined as the first year of life. The image below shows various time periods. Only the time period for perinatal mortality and the perinatal period are different as shown in the image. For others, corresponding mortality rates are calculated using the same time periods shown.",

Adequate nutrition through breastfeeding. Early discharge and ambulatory care. Support for mother and family for child care. Evidence shows that- It is as good as incubators, in terms of safety and thermal protection (measured by mortality) Reduces severe morbidity by way of facilitating breastfeeding Humanization of neonatal care Promoted bonding between mother and child E igibility criteria for KMC: It is indicated for all hemodynamically stable low birth weight babies. Short sessions of KMC can be initiated in babies on medical treatment like IV fluids or oxygen therapy. Initiation of KMC can vary with the birth weight of the baby. Birth weight <1200 g - It may take days to weeks for initiation of KMC Birth weight =1200-1800 g - Only a few days may be taken before KMC initiation Birth weight >1800 g - KMC can be initiated immediately after birth All mothers without any serious illness can provide KMC. Positioning for KMC: The baby is placed between the mother's breast in an upright position. The hips are abducted and flexed in the frog position and the arms are also flexed. The abdomen of the baby should be at the level of the mother's epigastrium. In this position, the mother's breathing would stimulate the baby and prevent the development of apnea. The duration of KMC should be gradually increased from short sessions of more than one hour to 24 hours a day. KMC is not necessary once the baby attains 2500 g of weight or 37 weeks of gestation. Note: Incubatory care, feeding via nasal catheter, and prevention of infection are part of intensive care for low birthweight babies.",

It is detected in the ileum at about 70–85 days of fetal life and begins to fill the colon and lower ileum late in the 4th month of gestation. The greenish color of the meconium is the consequence of the bile pigments excreted by the biliary tract. The main component responsible for the greenish color of the meconium is biliverdin (a pigment formed from the oxidation of bilirubin). Up to the 22nd week of gestation, the intestinal content is not greenish and for this reason, fetal defecation would not stain the amniotic fluid. The production of biliverdin starts over the next few weeks or at a time closer to labor, probably due to a biochemical switch related to the bilirubin oxidation system. Bilirubin is responsible for the yellow color of the stools. Neonates do not harbor gut flora at birth.",

Hence, the Moro reflex is absent Option C: In stage III HIE, the muscles are flaccid and the infant is comatose. Thus, the Moro reflex is absent.

This incompatibility between the mother and fetus generally results in milder disease than Rh incompatibility does. It arises when a mother with blood group type O becomes pregnant with a fetus of different blood type (A/B). The mother's serum contains naturally occurring anti-A and anti-B, which can cross the placenta and cause hemolysis of fetal RBCs. Although antibodies against A and B factors occur without previous immunization (natural antibodies), they are usually IgM, which do not cross the placenta. However, IgG antibodies to A antigen may be present, and these do cross the placenta, resulting in A-O iso-immune hemolytic disease in the first-born infant (A-O is more common than B-O).",

Hypocalcemia is defined as a total serum calcium concentration of less than 8 mg/dL for a term baby (ionized calcium below 4mg/dL) and less than 7 mg/dL for a preterm baby. Asymptomatic neonates can be managed conservatively with early nutrition. Symptomatic neonates should receive iv or oral calcium replacement. Maternal hyperglycemia causes fetal hyperglycemia, and the fetal pancreatic response leads to fetal hyperinsulinemia, which causes neonatal hypoglycemia. Neonatal hypoglycemia is defined as blood glucose <40 mg/dL (plasma glucose <45 mg/dL). The infant tends to be jittery, tremulous, hyperexcitable, hypotonic, lethargic, and poor sucking during the 1st three days after birth.

It occurs when there is a failure in the closure of the body wall in the abdominal region. The defects seen in the ventral body wall include: Gastroschisis- The intestinal loops herniate through the defect in the abdominal wall. The defect usually lies to one side of the umbilicus (right side commonly). The loops of the bowel are not covered by amnion as they herniate through the abdominal wall directly into the amniotic cavity. The affected bowel loops can be damaged by exposure to amniotic fluid. Omphalocele- The bowel loops fail to return from the physiologic umbilical hernia. Since the umbilicus is covered by a reflection of the amnion, the omphalocele is also covered by amnion. Congenital umbilical hernia- This is due to a failure of the umbilical ring to close after physiologic herniation of the intestines. Ectopia Vesicae/ Bladder exstrophy is a congenital abnormality that occurs when the lower abdominal wall does not form properly and the bladder is open and exposed.",

A focal clonic seizure is characterized by multiple, repetitive, rhythmic contractions of muscle groups of the limbs, face, or trunk, maybe unifocal or multifocal. It may occur synchronously or asynchronously in muscle groups on one side of the body. It may occur simultaneously but asynchronously on both sides. It cannot be suppressed by restraint. Other options: Option A: Focal tonic seizures are characterized by sustained posturing of a single limb, sustained asymmetrical posturing of the trunk, and sustained eye deviation. They cannot be provoked by stimulation or suppressed by restraint. Option C: Spasms are sudden generalized jerks lasting 1-2 sec and are usually associated with a single, very brief, generalized discharge. They may be flexor, extensor, or mixed extensor/flexor and can occur in clusters. They too cannot be provoked by stimulation or suppressed by restraint. Option D: Subtle seizures include transient eye deviations, nystagmus, blinking, mouthing, abnormal extremity movements (rowing, swimming, cycling, pedalling), fluctuations in heart rate, hypertension episodes, and apnea. They are more common in preterm than in term babies. Myoclonic seizures are random, single, rapid muscle contractions of the limbs, face, or trunk. They are not repetitive or may recur at a slow rate. They can be generalized, focal, or fragmentary. They can be provoked by stimulation. Clinically apparent seizures in a neonate should be treated if they last >3 minutes or are brief serial seizures.

Uteroplacental gas exchange is maintained throughout the procedure. Option A: BiPAP machines provide positive airway pressure during exhalation and additional positive pressure during inspiration. It allows for adjusting of inspiratory and expiratory pressures. The additional pressures augment tidal volume and improve alveolar ventilation. Children with neuromuscular weakness and intrathoracic airway obstruction benefit from this. Option C: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of cardiopulmonary bypass that augments systemic perfusion and provides gas exchange. This may be helpful to prevent and treat hypoxia and respiratory acidosis and decrease the work of breathing in ARDS, central apnea, refractory shock, severe sepsis, pulmonary hypertension, etc. Option D: CPAP is provided via a high-flow nasal cannula, with a gas flow of 4-16 L/min.

The chronological age is the actual age in term babies. However, in preterm infants, a corrected age rather than postnatal age is used till two years of age. This is used to account for the small gap in neurological development that premature children have yet to catch up. For example, a child born at 32 weeks gestation (gestational age) seen at 12 weeks of age (postnatal age), should be considered as a 4-week-old (corrected age) child. If there is a delay (DQ<70%) in more than 2 domains, then global developmental delay (GDD) is suspected.",

        "explanation": "Thumbsucking in a child is a way of discharging tension. It is a self-limiting habit disorder, usually seen between 6 months to 2 years. Option A: Pica is persistent ingestion of non-nutritive substances for at least 1 month. It hampers the development of the child and requires clinical attention. Children with pica are at an increased risk of lead poisoning, iron-deficiency anemia, and parasitic infections. Option B: Breath-holding spells: It is preceded by a provocative event such as anger. Crying stops at full expiration. Child may have apnoea, cyanosis, pallor, hypotonia, or even loss of consciousness, and generalized tonic–clonic seizure (GTCS). Subtypes include cyanotic, pallid, and mixed episodes. Seizures and cardiac causes should be ruled out. Parents should be reassured that breath-holding spells are self-limiting. Option D: Enuresis: When the child has never been dry, it is called primary enuresis. When the bedwetting starts after a minimum period of six months of dryness at night, it is termed as secondary enuresis. Nocturnal enuresis is caused due to maturational delay. In a normal individual, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels usually peak between 4 am and 8 am. This circadian rhythm is impaired in nocturnal enuresis, leading to bedwetting. Treatment - Behavioural therapy with positive reinforcement, bladder alarms, and desmopressin reserved for cases resistant to behavioural therapy.",

The general treatment involves 10 steps in 2 phases: Initial stabilization phase: It focuses on restoring homeostasis and treating medical conditions and requires 2-7 days of inpatient treatment. Mnemonic: SHIELDED Sugar deficiency(hypoglycemia) Hypothermia Infection ELectrolyte imbalance DEhydration Deficiency of nutrients Rehabilitation phase: It focuses on rebuilding wasted tissue and generally takes several weeks. Steps: Treat hypoglycemia (blood glucose level <54 mg/dl): if symptomatic, give 10% Dextrose IV at 5ml/kg. Feeding should be initiated with starter F-75 (formula with 75 kcal/100 ml of feed) Treat hypothermia (axillary <35°C or 95°F): Skin-to-skin contact with care called “kangaroo technique” or dress in warmer clothes, cover head, wrap in a warmed blanket, and provide indirect heat. Treat dehydration: Hydrate with ReSoMal (45 mmol Na/L). It is a low-sodium rehydration solution for malnutrition. Correct electrolyte imbalance: There is a deficit of potassium and magnesium and excess sodium. Give extra potassium (3 to 4 mEq/kg/day) and magnesium (4 mEq/ kg/day) for at least 2 weeks. Treat an infection: Starting on the first day, give broad-spectrum antibiotics to all children. Correct micronutrient deficiencies: Do not give iron in the stabilization phase, because excess iron leads to free radical injury. Give iron 3 mg/kg/day once the child starts gaining weight after the stabilization phase. Give vitamin A on day 1. Repeat on day 2 and day 14. Folic acid 1 mg (5 mg on day 1) Zinc (2 mg/kg/day) Copper (0.3 mg/kg/day) Start cautious feeding: Give ù to 12 small feeds of F75 feeds. It is low-lactose milk that contains 75 kcal and 0.9 g protein per 100 mL. After 3 days, transition to F100 feeds is made which is called a catch-up diet. This provides 100 kcal and 2.9 g protein per 100 mL. After 1 week, calories are further increased to 150–200 kcal/kg/day and protein to 4–6 g/kg/day. Rehabilitation: The indications of entry to this phase are reduced/minimal oedema and the return of appetite. Beginning of feeding. After 3 days, the transition to energy-dense feeding Stimulation of emotional and sensorial development Transfer to home-based diet",

When accompanied by loose stools, management includes the use of low sodium ORS for rehydration of 5ml/kg every 30 min for the first 2 hours. Management of fluid/electrolyte status in SAM: Do not give IV fluids unless the child is in shock. Give ReSoMal (low-sodium rehydration solution for malnutrition) 5 mL/kg every 30 min for the first 2 hr orally or NG tube. Then give 5-10 mL/kg in alternate hours for up to 10 hour. The amount depends on stool loss and eagerness to drink. Feed every other alternate hour. Give ReSoMal after each watery stool as a prevention strategy. Do not continue aggressive hydration even after dehydration resolves. Treatment of hypoglycemia in malnutrition: If conscious: 10% glucose (50 mL) orally or 1 teaspoon sugar under the tongue, whichever is the quickest. If unconscious: Immediately give sterile 10% glucose (5 mL/kg) by IV. Note: 50% glucose is never used in children as it is extremely viscous and concentrated.

Hypophosphatemic rickets: linked dominant hypophosphatemic rickets is the most common genetic cause of rickets while the most common, overall is nutritional vitamin D deficiency. PHEX gene (phosphate-regulating endopeptidase on x chromosome) products are responsible for the inactivation of phosphatonin. Mutation of this PHEX leads to increased phosphatonin (FGF 23) levels, and hence, the excretion of phosphorous is increased. This is also associated with impaired renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate leading to its excess excretion. The chart attached below summarizes the evaluation of hypophosphatemic rickets. Treatment-resistant rickets : Patients respond well to a combination of oral phosphorus and 1,25-D (calcitriol). Frequent dosing helps prevent prolonged decrements in serum phosphorus levels because there is a rapid decline after each dose. In addition, frequent dosing decreases diarrhea, which is a complication of high-dose oral phosphorus.",

It is an autosomal recessive disorder seen in infants due to a defect in the intestinal zinc-specific transporter gene. Oral zinc therapy is the preferred management. It classically presents while weaning from breast milk to formula, which has lower zinc bioavailability than breast milk. The symptoms are perioral and perineal rashes, periungual dermatitis- Beau’s lines on nails, chronic diarrhea, and alopecia. Children commonly present with symmetrical, eczematous plaques that become vesicular, bullous, pustular, or erosive with characteristic crusting at the edges. The perioral eruption usually spares the upper lip, giving it a U■shaped or horseshoe■shaped appearance. Investigations would reveal low serum zinc. Oral zinc therapy is the treatment of choice (3 mg/kg/24 hour) Option A: Wiskott Aldrich syndrome is the classical triad of thrombocytopenia, eczema and recurrent pyogenic infections. No history of bleeding rules out this option. Option C: Epidermolysis bullosa presents as bullous lesions in pressure handling areas. Option D: In atopic dermatitis usually the lesions will be itchy and distributed in extensor aspects (flexural in adults).",

Female carriers usually are protected because of the random inactivation of one X chromosome.

It may be congenital or acquired. Congenital color blindness can be dyschromatopsia (defective color vision of any one of the RGB colors) or achromatopsia (complete color blindness of all three RGB colors).

High blood levels of phenylalanine saturate the transport system across the blood-brain barrier causing inhibition of the cerebral uptake of other large neutral amino acids such as tyrosine and tryptophan impairing brain protein synthesis. Microcephaly, prominent maxillae with widely spaced teeth, enamel hypoplasia, and growth retardation are other common findings in untreated children. Low bone mineral density and osteopenia have been reported in affected individuals of all ages. Excess phenylalanine is metabolized to phenyl ketones (phenylpyruvate and phenylacetate) that are excreted in the urine. However, these metabolites have no role in the pathogenesis of CNS damage; their presence in body fluids simply signifies the severity of the condition. Hypotyrosinemia can be partially responsible for the signs and symptoms but the primary cause is hyperphenylalaninemia. Laboratory diagnoses of phenylketonuria include: Guthrie's test: growth of bacillus subtilis is seen Ferric chloride urine test: transient blue-green color Blood phenylalanine levels: elevated Enzyme studie Genetic mutation studie Tandem mass spectrometry: Gold standard screening method for all metabolic disorders.",

        "correct_option": "c",
        "explanation": "Biotin is the treatment of choice for multiple carboxylase deficiency. Multiple carboxylase deficiency refers to one of two inherited defects of biotin metabolism. Tomcat urine is characteristically seen in multiple carboxylase deficiency. Neonatal/infantile form is caused by a deficiency of holocarboxylase synthetase and presents in the first week of life with lethargy, poor muscle tone, and vomiting. Juvenile/late form is caused by biotinidase deficiency and is associated with a slow but progressive loss of biotin in the urine, leading to organic aciduria. It is characterized by alopecia, ataxia, ketoacidosis, dermatitis, seizures, myoclonus, and nystagmus. Both infantile and late-onset multiple carboxylase deficiency can be treated with pharmacological doses of biotin. It is called multiple carboxylase deficiency because biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that is a cofactor for all 4 carboxylase enzymes in humans: Pyruvate carboxylase Acetyl CoA carboxylase Propionyl CoA carboxylase 3-methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase Note: Acquired deficiency of biotin may occur in infants receiving total parenteral nutrition without added biotin, in patients with prolonged use of antiepileptic drugs (phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, carbamazepine), and in children with short bowel syndrome or chronic diarrhea who are receiving formulas low in biotin. Excessive ingestion of raw eggs may also cause biotin deficiency because the protein avidin in egg white binds biotin, decreasing its absorption. Infants with a biotin deficiency may develop dermatitis, alopecia, and candidal skin infections. This condition readily responds to treatment with oral biotin.",

        "explanation": "This clinical vignette is strongly suggestive of I-cell disease or inclusion cell disease. It is also known as type II Mucolipidosis. It is an autosomal recessive inherited as a lysosomal storage disorder. It is caused due to a defect in N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase required for the Golgi to phosphorylate mannose residues on glycoproteins. This leads to defective mannose-6-phosphate, an important cell signaling molecule required for trafficking of the lysosomal enzyme from the site of its production in the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosome. Due to this defect, the lysosomal enzymes are secreted out of the cell and there is an increased serum concentration of the same. Intracellularly, there are abnormal inclusion bodies and vacuolizations, thus earning the disease its name. Clinically, these patients present with symptoms either at birth or early in life with growth retardation, failure to thrive, delay of developmental milestones, coarse facial features with a cloudy cornea and gingival hypertrophy, and other non-specific findings such as hip dislocations, inguinal hernias, hepatomegaly, joint limitation, and skin changes. Investigations to establish a diagnosis may include measuring N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase activity in WBCs or in cultured fibroblasts and estimating serum levels of lysosomal enzymes. Option B: Galactosemia is caused due to the complete absence of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase. The deficiency of this enzyme leads to an inability to convert galactose-1-phosphate (galactose-1-P) to uridine diphosphate galactose. It is characterized by typical clinical features such as jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, failure to thrive, poor feeding, lethargy, diarrhea, E.Coli sepsis. Infants may also have edema, ascites, full fontanelle, encephalopathy, and excessive bruising and bleeding. They tend to develop cataracts due to the accumulation of galactitol. Option C: Adrenoleukodystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder of -oxidation of fatty acids. There is a very large chain fatty acids buildup in the adrenal glands, the white matter of the brain, and testes. It is a progressive disease that can lead to adrenal gland crisis, coma, and death. Option D: Hurler syndrome is an important diagnosis in a patient presenting with clinical features given in this clinical vignette. But it is a mucopolysaccharidosis type 1-H caused due by the defect in the -L Iduronidase leading to the accumulation of heparin sulfate and dermatan sulfate. It is characterized by skeletal abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, and severe intellectual disability. Infants develop characteristic coarse facial features, a wide nasal bridge, and a flattened midface. Features such as hepatosplenomegaly, umbilical or inguinal hernias, and typical skeletal abnormalities, known as dysostosis multiplex laos are also seen.

It is the severe form of mucopolysaccharidoses type 1 (MPS 1), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in -L iduronidase, leading to the accumulation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. The child usually presents between 6 and 24 months with hepatosplenomegaly, coarse facial features (shown below), corneal clouding, large tongue, prominent forehead, joint stiffness, short stature, and skeletal dysplasia. Most patients have recurrent upper respiratory tract and ear infections, noisy breathing, and persistent copious nasal discharge. Radiograph shows skeletal dysplasia, called dysostosis multiplex - thick ribs, ovoid vertebral bodies, enlarged and trabeculated diaphyses of the long bones with irregular metaphysis and epiphysis. Macrocephaly, enlarged J-shaped sella, premature closure of lambdoid sagittal sutures, and shallow orbits are seen with disease progression. Obstructive airway disease, cardiac complications, and respiratory infections are the common causes of death. The image below shows the radiograph shows enlarged diaphyses of the metacarpal and phalanges. Other options: Option B: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome characterized by macrosomia, macroglossia, hemihypertrophy, omphalocele, and renal anomalies. It is associated with an increased risk of Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and adrenal cortical carcinoma. Option C: Proteus syndrome is a disturbance of cellular growth involving ectodermal and mesodermal tissues, caused by mutation in the AKT1 gene. They present with hemimegalencephaly, asymmetric overgrowth of the extremities, verrucous cutaneous lesions, thickening of the bone, and excessive growth of muscles. Option D: A child with untreated congenital hypothyroidism may have stunted growth, short extremities, narrow palpebral fissures, swollen eyelids, depressed nasal bridge, thick broad protruded tongue, and short and thick neck, dry and scaly skin.",

Inability to gain weight, hepatosplenomegaly, muscle weakness, and accumulation of abnormal glycogen resembling amylopectin point towards the diagnosis. Andersen's disease is type IV glycogen storage disease. It is transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern and occurs due to a deficiency of glycogen branching enzyme because of pathologic variants in the GBE1 gene. This leads to accumulation of of an abnormal structure of glycogen known as polyglucosan. It is characterized by Growth delay Hepatomegaly due to the accumulation of polysaccharides with few branch points Myopathy There might be fasting intolerance and ketosis in the initial stages. Hypoglycemia usually appears late in the disease when it is associated with cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and ascites. Biopsy of the liver will show the presence of abnormal glycogen which resembles amylopectin. Amylopectin is found in plants and has very few branches. Since there is a defect in the branching of the glycogen, the abnormal glycogen appears like amylopectin. The diagnosis is confirmed by absent branching enzyme activity in skin fibroblasts, muscle, or liver and analysis of the DNA mutation. Von Gierke's disease (Option A) has features of lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, impaired growth, and bone thinning. It occurs due to a defect in the glucose 6-phosphatase. McArdle disease (Option C) usually manifests as exercise intolerance, muscle cramping with exercise. It is usually a benign chronic condition. It occurs due to a defect in the muscle glycogen phosphorylase. Tarui disease (Option D) also presents similar to the McArdle disease. Patients may have developmental delay, and hemolytic anemia in addition to exercise-induced muscle cramps. It occurs due to a defect in the muscle phosphofructokinase.",

In the given case scenario, the child becomes symptomatic after ingesting fruit juice that contains fructose; this indicates that she has hereditary fructose intolerance, which is caused by the deficiency of aldolase B. Deficiency of fructose-1,6- bisphosphate aldolase (Aldolase B hereditary fructose intolerance): Fructose aldolase B is present in the liver, kidney, and intestine. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into triose phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate. Clinical features: Patients are asymptomatic until fructose or sucrose is ingested (usually from fruit, fruit juice, sweetened cereal, or table sugar). Clinical features include jaundice, hepatomegaly, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, and convulsions. It resembles galactosemia. Acute ingestion causes symptomatic hypoglycemia. Chronic intake results in failure to thrive and hepatic disease. The persistence of fructose intake can lead to liver failure, kidney failure, and death. Diagnosis: Reducing substance is seen in the urine during an episode (Benedict's test +). An assay of fructaldolase B activity in the liver gives a definitive diagnosis. Treatment: Complete elimination of all sources of sucrose, fructose, and sorbitol from the diet. With age, symptoms become milder even after fructose ingestion. The long-term prognosis is good. Note: The deficiency of fructokinase is not associated with any clinical manifestations. Fructosuria is an accidental finding usually made because the asymptomatic patient's urine contains a reducing substance. No treatment is necessary, and the prognosis is excellent.",

It damages motor and autonomic nerves; sensory nerves are not involved. Poliovirus is a non-enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family. Three antigenically distinct serotypes (types 1, 2, and 3) are known. Ages 6 months to 5 years are most commonly affected. The virus is transmitted via the fecal-oral route and has an incubation period of 8-12 days. Humans are the only known reservoir for the polioviruses. The virus colonizes and replicates in the GI mucosa (M cells), followed by entry into the blood via regional lymph nodes. In blood, it causes viremia and gets access to the CNS via the peripheral nerves, finally reaching the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord. Most cases are subclinical. Some have minor illnesses like fever, sore throat, headache, and malaise. It can present as non-paralytic polio (aseptic meningitis) or paralytic polio (flaccid paralysis with absent deep tendon reflexes). Most frequently, the completely affected muscle is the tibialis anterior. It is asymmetric paralysis which is more severe if strenuous physical exercise occurred during the onset of paralysis. Death usually occurs due to respiratory paralysis. Vaccination schedule for polio: Live attenuated: oral polio vaccine (OPV) (Sabin) at birth (day 0); then boosters at 6, 10, and 14 weeks and at 15-18 months; additional doses till 5 years Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) (Salk) given intradermally; two fractional doses at 6 and 14 weeks as well as 9 months of age.",

Rarely, patients can have the following presentations: Abortive poliomyelitis - a minor illness, manifested by fever, malaise, sore throat, or headache. Non-paralytic poliomyelitis - manifested by aseptic meningitis. Paralytic poliomyelitis - aseptic meningitis followed by severe back, neck, and muscle pain with rapid/gradual onset of motor weakness. It is the least common presentation of poliovirus infection. Wild poliovirus type 2 was eradicated in 1999. Until 2015, over 90% of cVDPV (circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses) cases were due to the type 2 component in OPV. Bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains serotypes 1 and 3.

Methods to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV include the following: Antiretroviral therapy (ART): Single-dose nevirapine at the onset of labor followed by a single dose to the newborn within 72 hours of birth. Zidovudine can also be used from the 2nd trimester onwards throughout pregnancy and for 6 weeks after birth to infancy. Breastfed infants should receive NVP for 6 weeks if the mother is receiving cART, or NVP for the duration of breastfeeding if the mother is not on therapy. Formula-fed infants in resource-limited countries should receive ZDV bid or NVP qd for 6 weeks. Elective cesarean section* Breastfeeding: Usually contraindicated, except in developing countries where breastfeeding may be continued for 6 months. *Note: Maternal cART is documented to decrease the rate of perinatal HIV-1 transmission to <2%, and <1% if the mother’s viral RNA level is <1,000 copies/mL at delivery. Thus, elective C-section at 38 weeks of gestation should be considered only for women whose viral load is >1,000 copies/ mL in late gestation, to further reduce the risk of vertical transmission. Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral drugs during C-section are as follows: For elective (planned) C-section, ART should be given prior to the operation. Women on lifelong ART should continue their standard ART regimen. In case of emergency C-section in pregnant women who are not on ART, the three-drug regimen should be started before the surgery and continued thereafter.",

Therefore, the criteria are slightly modified for moderate to high-risk populations as follows: The major criterion of arthritis includes polyarthralgia or monoarthritis in addition to polyarthritis. Polyarthralgia should only be considered as a major manifestation after the exclusion of other causes. The minor criterion for joint involvement is monoarthralgia. A lower cutoff for fever is used (38°C [100.4°F] rather than 38.5°C [101.3°F]). A lower cutoff for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is used (30 mm/hour rather than 60 mm/hour), although the C-reactive protein (CRP) cutoff is unchanged (3 mg/dL).",

Clostridium tetani is a spore-forming obligate anaerobe commonly found in soil, dust, and gastrointestinal tracts of various animals. The baby's umbilical stump covered with cow dung serves as the source of infection. It also occurs in infants of unimmunized mothers. Tetanus typically manifests within 3-12 days of birth as progressive difficulty in feeding, rigidity, or spasms. Tetanus toxin binds at the neuromuscular junction and enters the motor nerve; it is then transported to the alpha-motoneuron via retrograde axonal transport. Subsequently, the toxin enters the adjacent spinal inhibitory interneurons, where it prevents the release of the neurotransmitters glycine and -aminobutyric acid. This leads to blockade of normal antagonistic muscle inhibition, while agonist muscles undergo sustained contraction without relaxing. Neonatal tetanus presents with progressive feeding difficulty (sucking and swallowing), irritability, and crying. Characteristic features include reduced movement or complete muscle paralysis, rigidity, and spasms. These features may or may not be associated with opisthotonos. Treatment includes supportive care in the form of muscle relaxants (diazepam), along with the administration of human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) and metronidazole, which is the antibiotic of choice. Parenteral penicillin G can serve as an alternate antibiotic. Excising the umbilical stump in a baby with neonatal tetanus is no longer recommended.",

Underlying soft tissue edema and enlarged lymph nodes can cause a bull-neck appearance Patients with laryngeal diphtheria are at risk for suffocation because of local soft-tissue edema and airway obstruction by the diphtheritic membrane. Cutaneous diphtheria is an indolent, non-progressive infection characterized by a superficial, ecthyma-like, non-healing ulcer with a gray-brown membrane. Occasionally, it causes mucocutaneous infections at other sites, such as otitis externa, purulent conjunctivitis, and vulvo-vaginitis.

        "explanation": "The incidence of Brugia malayi is more in children from Bihar and the image showing microfilaria with two nuclei at the tail. Hence the organism is Brugia malayi, which causes lymphatic filariasis. Brugia malayi (Malayan filariasis), Brugia timori, and Wuchereria bancrofti (bancroftian filariasis) are thread-like nematodes that cause a similar infection called Filariasis. Infective larvae are introduced into humans during sucking of blood by the mosquito vector (commonly, culex). Clinical manifestations include episodic fever, lymphangitis of an extremity, lymphadenitis (especially the inguinal and axillary areas), headaches, and myalgias. Hepatosplenomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy are often seen in children. These symptoms are caused by an acute inflammatory response triggered by the death of adult worms. Diagnosis is done by demonstration of microfilariae in the blood. Blood samples should be obtained between 10 pm and 2 am because microfilaremia is nocturnal. Treatment: Diethylcarbamazine 1 mg/kg PO as a single dose on day 1 1 mg/kg tid on day 2 1-2mg/kg tid on day 3 6 mg/kg/day divided tid on days 4-14 The image below shows the difference between microfilaria of various filarial nematodes.",

        "explanation": "The likely cause of seizures in a child who has multiple ring-enhancing lesions and dietary history of pork intake is an infection with Taenia solium. Children acquire the adult form of the parasite by ingestion of undercooked pork containing larvae cysts. In the intestines, the cyst converts into adult form. The adult form releases eggs in the stool. If the eggs are ingested (shed by tapeworm carriers or by unhygienic practices), the larvae are released from the eggs. The larva then invades through the intestines and migrate through the bloodstream to the muscles (and other organs), where they form tissue cysts called cysticercosis. When these larvae find their way to the brain, it is termed as neurocysticercosis. Neurocysticercosis typically presents with seizures (focal or generalized). It can be associated with basilar arachnoiditis that can present with signs of meningeal irritation. Cysticerci in the tissues may present with focal findings from the mass effect. Ocular neurocysticercosis causes decreased visual acuity because of cysticerci in the retina or vitreous, retinal detachment, or iridocyclitis. Treatment includes management of seizures. albendazole therapy (treatment of choice). Praziquantel can also be used.",

Congenital toxoplasmosis: When a mother acquires the infection during gestation, organisms may disseminate hematogenously to the placenta. Infection may be transmitted to the fetus transplacentally or during vaginal delivery. The characteristic triad of chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, and cerebral calcifications may be present.

Congenital toxoplasmosis occurs when a pregnant woman acquires the infection during gestation. The organism may cross to the fetus transplacentally or at the time of vaginal delivery. The severity of the disease in the neonate is greater if the woman gets infected early in her pregnancy. The causative agent is Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular protozoan. The diagnosis is made by the detection of IgM anti-toxoplasma antibodies. IgG can cross the placenta is hence, cannot confirm infection in the infant. IgM immunosorbent agglutination assay (ISAGA) and IgA ELISA are the most useful diagnostic tests. Spiramycin can be administered for cases of acute infection in early pregnancy to reduce vertical transmission. It does not cross the placenta and therefore cannot be used to treat an infected fetus. Pyrimethamine-sulfonamide (to be avoided in the first trimester) is used when a fetal infection is confirmed or in maternal infections after 18 weeks.",

All pregnant women should receive a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine during each pregnancy, as early in the 27–36-week-of-gestation window as possible. The maternal antibodies formed from Tdap will provide immunity against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis in the newborn.

The appearance of these spots, along with a rash appearing three days later, strongly suggests a diagnosis of measles. The measles virus is a single-stranded RNA virus. Measles infection has 4 phases: the incubation period, prodromal illness, exanthematous phase (characterized by the rash), and recovery phase. After an incubation period of 8-12 days, the prodromal phase of measles starts with mild fever and is followed by conjunctivitis, photophobia, coryza, cough, and increasing fever. Koplik spots, appearing 1-4 days prior to the rash, are a characteristic sign of measles. Symptoms gradually intensify over a period of 2-4 days until the first day of the rash. The rash typically begins on the forehead (around the hairline), behind the ears, and on the upper neck as a red maculopapular eruption. It then spreads downward to the torso and extremities, often becoming confluent on the face and upper trunk. Complications include acute otitis media (most common), pneumonia (the most common cause of death), croup, bronchiolitis, reactivation of tuberculosis, diarrhea, appendicitis, febrile seizures, and encephalitis.

A pH of 7.55 indicates alkalosis and plasma HCO3- is 30 mmol/L, which is in the higher range. Both these findings indicate metabolic alkalosis. Infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis develop a characteristic metabolic abnormality. i.e Hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria. Persistent vomiting results in loss of hydrochloric acid leading to the development of metabolic alkalosis (due to loss of H+) and hypochloremia (due to loss of Cl-). Kidneys try to compensate for alkalosis by secreting Na+ and HCO3-. However, loss of sodium stimulates the secretion of aldosterone through the RAAS pathway. The aldosterone causes active reabsorption of sodium in exchange for K+ and H+ ions. Loss of potassium ions leads to the development of hypokalemia. Loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH resulting in aciduria. It is called paradoxical aciduria, since the body initially lost H+ ions due to loss of HCl, and instead of compensating for that loss, the body is losing more H+ ions through urine. CHPS typically presents with the following: Non-bilious vomiting, which is progressive, maybe projectile, occurring immediately after a feed, usually presents after the 3rd week of age. As the vomiting continues, a progressive loss of fluid, hydrogen ions, chloride ions, and potassium leads to hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria. Hyperbilirubinemia is the most common clinical association of pyloric stenosis, which is also known as the icteropyloric syndrome.",

The investigation of choice to confirm the diagnosis is ultrasound. CHPS is associated with hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the pylorus resulting in constriction and obstruction of the gastric outlet. It is common between 3-6 weeks of age. First-born male infants are at the highest risk. Infants usually present with projectile, non-bilious vomiting. Clinically, an olive-shaped mass is palpable in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium. When the infant is given a test feed, visible peristalsis is usually observed moving from left to right, followed by projectile vomiting. The characteristic metabolic abnormality is hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to recurrent vomiting. Ultrasound features: Double-layered hypertrophic mucosa protrudes into the stomach, creating the so-called ‘Nipple sign’ The sonographic appearance of the hypertrophied pylorus resembles that of the uterine cervix nd is sometimes referred to as the ‘cervix sign’ The diagnostic criteria for pyloric stenosis are a muscle thickness of 4 mm and a pyloric length of 16 mm If ultrasound is inconclusive, contrast studies (barium) are performed, which demonstrate An elongated pyloric channel (string sign), A bulge of the pyloric muscle into the antrum (shoulder sign), and Parallel streaks of barium seen in the narrowed channel, producing a “double tract sign.” The image attached below shows the USG findings in CHPS.

Hirschsprung disease or congenital aganglionic colon is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexus. It is more common in males. Risk factors include Down's syndrome and RET oncogene. The imaging modality of choice in Hirschsprung's disease is a contrast radiograph with barium or gastrograffin enema (image shown above).

The rectum is seen as a narrow tube and a cone-shaped transition zone, seen proximal to the dilated ganglionated bowel. A rectal suction biopsy is a gold standard for the diagnosis and operative intervention is the definitive treatment. Definitive surgeries for Hirschsprung disease are as follows: Swenson procedure, where aganglionic bowel is removed and a coloanal anastomosis is performed. Duhamel procedure, where the aganglionic rectal stump is left in place and the ganglionated normal colon is pulled posterior. Soave procedure: In this procedure, endorectal mucosal dissection is done within the aganglionic distal rectum and then the ganglionated normal colon is pulled through the remnant muscular cuff, and a coloanal anastomosis is performed.

The condition is diagnosed by using stool examination which shows acidic stool positive for reducing substances. Treatment is by diet control using a diet devoid of lactose. It can be congenital due to lactase deficiency or acquired after post-viral gastroenteritis. In secretory diarrhoea, the epithelial cells’ ion transport processes are turned into a state of active secretion. The most common cause of acute-onset secretory diarrhoea is a bacterial infection of the gut. Chronic diarrhoea is, in many cases, the result of an intestinal infection that persists longer than expected.

In the small intestine, the upper villus enterocytes are differentiated cells, which have absorptive functions, such as the transport of water and electrolytes. On the other hand, the crypt enterocytes are undifferentiated cells and are net secretors of water and electrolytes. Selective viral infection of intestinal villus tip cells thus leads to decreased absorption of salt and water (proportionate loss of water and salt—isotonic dehydration) and an imbalance in the ratio of intestinal fluid absorption to secretion. Metabolic acidosis may be a result of stool bicarbonate losses in children with diarrhoea. These can also be seen due to secondary renal insufficiency or lactic acidosis as a sequelae to diarrhoea.",

Surfactant starts appearing in the fetal lung by 20 weeks of gestation. Levels indicating lung maturity are detected after 35 weeks. Surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates produced by type II pneumocytes in the lung epithelium. The absence of surfactant in the liquid film lining the alveoli causes an increase in surface tension and alveolar collapse. If not treated, such atelectasis leads to increased work of breathing, intrapulmonary shunting, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, hypoxia, and eventually respiratory failure. The relative concentration of the phospholipids lecithin (L) and sphingomyelin (S) is an indicator of lung maturity. The outward flow of pulmonary secretions from the fetal lungs into the amniotic fluid maintains the level of lecithin and sphingomyelin equally until 32–33 weeks gestation when the lecithin concentration begins to increase significantly while sphingomyelin remains nearly the same. An L–S ratio of 2.5 or more indicates fetal lung maturity while an L/S ratio of less than 1.5 is associated with a high risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome. Other tests done to assess fetal lung maturity are: Shake test/bubble test Phosphatidyl glycerol measurement Surfactant:albumin ratio Lamellar body counts",

Tests for the assessment of fetal lung maturity include: The Nile blue test involves staining desquamated fetal cells from amniotic fluid with 0.1% Nile blue sulfate. The presence of orange cells > 50% suggests lung maturity. Lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio at 31 to 32 weeks is 1, and at 35 weeks ratio is 2. The ratio 2 indicates lung maturity (option A). The shake test or bubble test (Clement's test) (option B) involves mixing amniotic fluid with 95% ethanol, shaking it for 15 seconds, and observing it for 15 minutes. A complete ring of bubbles at the meniscus is a positive test and indicates lung maturity. This is a useful bedside test. The presence of phosphatidylglycerol, (option C) saturated phosphatidylcholine and lamellar body count (>50,000/mcL) indicates lung maturity. Glucocorticoids accelerate lung maturation and lower the incidence of respiratory distress and eonatal mortality in preterms if the birth was delayed for at least 24 hours after initiation of betamethasone. A single course of corticosteroids is recommended for women between 24 and 36 weeks who are at risk of delivery within 7 days.

Severe overinflation can lead to air leak syndromes such as pneumothorax. Meconium consists of water, desquamated GIT cells, skin, lanugo hair, vernix, bile salts, pancreatic enzymes, lipids, and mucopolysaccharides. The bile salts and pancreatic enzymes can cause chemical pneumonitis. Meconium can also cause surfactant inactivation by displacing it from the alveolar surface and inhibiting its surface tension-lowering ability. Severe MAS is associated with remodelling and thickening of the muscular walls, resulting in pulmonary hypertension. Infants who develop MAS typically present in the first 12 hours after birth with varying&deg; of respiratory distress. On inspection, many affected infants have 'barrel chests'; crackles (rales) and rhonchi often can be heard on auscultation.

Pneumonia caused by C. trachomatis can develop in 10–20% of infants born to women with active, untreated chlamydial infection. Only approximately 25% of infants with nasopharyngeal chlamydial infection develop pneumonia. trachomatis pneumonia of infancy has a very characteristic presentation. It usually occurs between 1-3 months of age and is insidious, with a persistent cough, tachypnea, and absence of fever. Auscultation reveals rales; wheezing is uncommon. The absence of fever and wheezing helps to distinguish C. trachomatis pneumonia from respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia. A distinctive laboratory finding is the presence of peripheral eosinophilia (>400 cells/µL). The most consistent finding on chest radiograph is hyperinflation accompanied by minimal interstitial or alveolar infiltrates.",

The most common type of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia (postero-lateral diaphragmatic hernia); other types include Morgagni hernia (anterior-parasternal), diaphragm eventration, and central tendon defects of the diaphragm. Malformation of the diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to push into the chest cavity, hindering proper lung formation and expansion. Immediate steps of management: Endotracheal intubation  Placement of a nasogastric tube  Administration of fluids and inotropic agents  Administration of surfactant therapy to only preterm infants with findings suggestive of respiratory distress syndrome.Other options: Option B: Bag and mask ventilation is to be avoided as they lead to gastric/abdominal distension and compression of the lung. Option C: Both arterial and central venous lines are inserted; however, this is not the first line of intervention.

A diaphragmatic hernia is defined as a communication between the abdominal and thoracic cavities with or without abdominal contents in the thorax. It is mostly congenital, with a defective formation of the pleuroperitoneal membrane. Females are affected twice as often as males. Bochdalek hernia accounts for up to 90% of the hernias seen in the newborn period, with 80-90% occurring on the left side. So, the heart will be pushed to the right side (dextroposition). Predictors of a poor prognosis include an associated major anomaly, symptoms before completion of 24 hours since birth, severe pulmonary hypoplasia, herniation to the contralateral lung, and the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

Pressures in both the right and left ventricles are equal in a developing fetus. The upper part of the body is perfused exclusively by the left ventricle while the lower extremities are perfused by the right ventricle.",

Survival of newborns with certain heart lesions such as coarctation of the aorta, hypoplastic left heart syndrome and transposition of great vessels depends on the patency of ductus arteriosus. Closure of PDA in such conditions can lead to hypoperfusion, severe hypoxia and cyanosis. PGE1 is a potent and specific relaxant of ductal smooth muscle. PGE1 analogues like alprostadil, misoprost and rioprostil can be used to keep the ductus open and support systemic blood supply. In patent ductus arteriosus, the ductus is closed medically by NSAIDS (which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis) like ibuprofen trometamol/ ibuprofen lysine and indomethacin.

Most ASDs are asymptomatic and are picked up during routine physical examinations. A soft ejection systolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border is also commonly found. The soft ejection systolic murmur is a flow murmur heard due to increased blood flow through the normal pulmonary valve. A delayed diastolic murmur can also be heard in the tricuspid area. As the right ventricle now receives more blood, the time required for its emptying is increased resulting in prolonged P2. Since the two atria are linked, inspiration does not produce any net pressure changes between them abolishing respiration-related changes in venous return hence causing fixed S2. Causes of Wide and fixed splitting of S2 include, Atrial septal defect RBBB TAPVC Other options: TAPVC - patients usually present with cyanosis and congestive cardiac failure around 4-10 weeks of age - this is when the fetal pulmonary vasculature regresses and there is increased pulmonary blood flow which results in early-onset cardiac failure. The physical findings are identical to ASD. VSD - is an acyanotic heart disease and physical findings include a pansystolic murmur best heard in the left 4th parasternal area and a wide and variable split S2 which is usually masked by the pansystolic murmur. PS - is an acyanotic heart disease and physical findings include an ejection systolic murmur and a thrill in the left second interface and a wide and variable split S2 because of delayed closure of P2.",

Mitral valvular insufficiency increases the volume load on the left ventricle (seen as LAD & LVH on ECG). When mitral insufficiency is severe enough to cause clinical symptoms like fatigue on exertion, the left atrium enlarges as a result of the regurgitant flow, and the left ventricle becomes hypertrophied and dilated.",

In VSD, the pulmonary artery left atrium, and left ventricle are enlarged. I Tricuspid atresia, there is right to left shunting of blood through an ASD as the tricuspid valve is dysfunctional due to which the entire systemic venous return enters the left side of the heart using the foramen ovale or through an ASD, and hence, there is left ventricular hypertrophy.",

Ray in TOF showing boot shaped heart: Acyanotic/pink tetralogy of Fallot: This occurs when obstruction to the right ventricular outflow is mild to moderate. The blood would flow more through the mildly obstructed RVOT and less through the VSD. Hence, there is less cyanosis.",

Any build-up of pressure in the right ventricle due to PS is released through VSD to the left ventricle. Option A: P2 is of low intensity and soft because the right ventricular outflow obstruction results in reduced pulmonary artery pressure. Option B: The aortic root usually appears large because it overrides (straddling) the VSD, allowing deoxygenated blood shunted from the right ventricle mixed with blood from the left ventricle to exit the heart. Option D: The large 'a' wave in the jugular pulse is a reflection of the forceful contraction of the right atrium at the end of diastole as there is reduced distensibility of the hypertrophic right ventricle.",

In severe&deg;, pulmonary blood flow predominantly depends on the ductus arteriosus. As soon as the duct closes, the baby presents with cyanosis and circulatory collapse in the neonatal period. Clinical features include significant hypercyanotic spells in infants which are characterised by hyperpnea, cyanosis, and gasping followed by syncope. The spells occur most frequently in the morning on initially awakening or after episodes of vigorous crying. These spells are due to a prolonged reduction of pulmonary blood flow resulting in severe systemic hypoxia and metabolic acidosis. Older children present with exertional dyspnea and assume a squatting position to relieve the dyspneic episode after which the child is able to resume the activity.",

        "explanation": "The given chest x-ray shows an egg-on-string appearance seen in the transposition of great arteries (TGA). Enlargement of the left atrium is seen in TGA, not the right atrium. The reason for left atrial enlargement is due to increased pulmonary blood flow. TGA is characterized by the aorta arising from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle. This abnormal configuration leads to a narrow vascular pedicle. As pulmonary vascular resistance drops during the first few days of life, blood flow through the pulmonary vasculature is increased. There is also elevated pulmonary venous pressure seen in TGA, especially in infants with an intact interventricular septum. The globular (egg) appearance of the heart due to abnormal convexity of the right atrial border and left atrial enlargement, and the narrow superior mediastinum (string) result in the classical egg-on-string appearance. TGA is the most specific heart disease in infants of diabetic mothers. Early management includes an immediate infusion of prostaglandin E1 which keeps the ductus arteriosus patent for improving oxygenation. Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy is a palliative catheter-based intervention that can be done to improve the hypoxic state before definitive surgery. The procedure creates an opening in the atrial septum which allows better inter-circulatory mixing of the blood. Jatene arterial switch procedure is the definitive surgery. Most infants with TGA do not survive till adulthood without corrective surgery.",

If the patient is receiving corticosteroid-sparing agents (cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine), live virus vaccines are contraindicated. Option C: Only live vaccines are contraindicated in this child. Full pneumococcal vaccination (with the 13-valent conjugate vaccine and 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine) and influenza vaccination can be given annually to the child and their household contacts. Option D: Immunization of siblings/healthy household contacts with live vaccines is necessary to reduce the risk of infection transmission to the immunosuppressed child. Direct exposure to the gastrointestinal/respiratory secretions of the household contacts is avoided for about 3-6 weeks after vaccination. Minimal change nephrotic syndrome is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome. It is characterized by heavy proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia. The diagnosis is confirmed by performing a urinalysis and urine protein: creatinine ratio. Nephrotic range proteinuria is proteinuria greater than 3.5 g per 24 hours (3+ or 4+) or a urine protein : creatinine ratio exceeding 2.

        "correct_option": "a",
        "explanation": "The clinical presentation of a young girl with continuous dribbling of urine, despite normal voiding, strongly suggests the diagnosis of an ectopic ureter. An ectopic ureter refers to a condition where the ureter drains outside the bladder. It is more common in females and opens either into the urethra below the sphincter or into the vagina. Hence, they present with constant urinary dripping all day, even though the child voids regularly (paradoxical incontinence). The terminal part of the ureter is frequently narrowed, leading to hydroureteronephrosis. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common due to urinary stasis. In males, ectopic ureters usually enter the posterior urethra above the external sphincter, hence they are usually continent and most patients present with UTI or epididymitis. Investigations include renal ultrasound (USG), voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), and renal scan to assess function. USG shows a hydronephrotic kidney or dilated upper pole and ureter. If there is a satisfactory function, the recommended treatment options are ureteral reimplantation into the bladder or ureteroureterostomy. The poor function may require partial or total nephrectomy. Other options: Option B: A ureterocele is a cystic dilation of the terminal ureter, typically obstructive due to a small ureteral opening. In childhood, they commonly present with infections. Larger ureteroceles can cause obstruction at the bladder neck. Option C: Congenital megaureter (dilated ureter) presents UTI, urinary stones, hematuria, and flank pain because of urinary stasis. Option D: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is characterized by the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder to the ureter and kidney. They usually present with recurrent attacks of UTI.",

The major NTDs include the following: Spina bifida occulta Meningocele Myelomeningocele Encephalocele Anencephaly Syringomyelia Diastematomyelia (split spinal cord) Iniencephaly In holoprosencephaly, the forebrain fails to develop into two hemispheres due to mutations in the sonic hedgehog gene at the long arm of chromosome 7. It is a developmental disorder of the brain that results from the defective formation of the prosencephalon and the inadequate induction of the forebrain structures.

It comprises a range of conditions, including spina bifida occulta, intradural lipoma, and dorsal dermal sinus. Spinal dysraphism is due to the defective fusion of the midline embryonic neural, vertebral, and mesenchymal structures. Associated clinical features are high-arched feet, muscle size and strength differences between legs, and abnormal walking patterns. In newborns and young infants, the neurological examination is usually normal, but older children may experience a lack of sensation in the perineal area and back pain. Most of the patients will have a cutaneous abnormality overlying the lower spine, including a small dimple, a tuft of hair, or a subcutaneous lipoma. The image shows a tuft of hair in a case of spinal dysraphism: Spinal dysraphism also includes meningocele, myelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, diastematomyelia (split spinal cord), thickened filum terminale, and cauda equina tumour. The initial investigation is usually ultrasound in the neonate and the best investigation is MRI. Spina bifida is the most common type of spinal dysraphism, in which the spinal column does not close completely, leaving the spinal cord and its protective covering exposed. Myelomeningocele is the most severe form of spina bifida, where the spinal cord and nerve roots are exposed and may be damaged. A sac-like protrusion, containing spinal cord tissue, meninges, and cerebrospinal fluid, is visible outside the body, often leading to significant neurological impairments and disabilities.",

Acetylcholinesterase is used as a biochemical marker of neural tube defects during the screening tests. NTDs account for the largest proportion of congenital anomalies of the CNS. The failure of closure of neural tube allows excretion of fetal substances such as -fetoprotein (AFP) and acetylcholinesterase into the amniotic fluid thereby serving as biochemical markers for NTDs. The lemon and banana sign, noted on antenatal imaging, are one of the many notable fruits' inspired signs. The banana sign refers to the shape of the cerebellum owing to caudal displacement while the lemon sign refers to the lemon-shaped head resulting from scalloping of the frontal bones. It is seen in fetuses with open neural tube defects. The image below shows the characteristic lemon sign on ultrasound- The image below shows the characteristic banana sign on ultrasound- Note: Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPPA), inhibin A, and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) are the biochemical markers of trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome).",

Congenital causes include structural abnormalities such as aqueductal stenosis, agenesis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walker malformations, Chiari malformations, and neural tube defects. Acquired causes are intracranial infections(cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis), intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic injury, and brain parenchymal tumors. Aqueductal stenosis is the narrowing or obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct, a narrow channel that connects the third and fourth ventricles in the brain. As a result, the fluid accumulates within the ventricles, causing them to enlarge. Treatment for aqueductal stenosis includes ventriculostomy, diuretics, serial lumbar punctures in specific cases, and CSF diversion. In severe cases, CSF diversion procedures (shunting), may be necessary to redirect the flow of CSF and relieve pressure on the brain.",

The child has developmental delay especially in motor and cognitive milestones because normally children walk independently at 12-13 months and become dry by day around 18 months. The Dandy-Walker malformation consists of a cystic expansion of the fourth ventricle in the posterior fossa and midline cerebellar hypoplasia. It results from a developmental failure of the roof of the fourth ventricle during embryogenesis. Most of the affected patients have hydrocephalus, agenesis of the posterior cerebellar vermis, and corpus callosum. Brisk tendon reflexes, spasticity, clonus, Babinski sign, cerebellar ataxia, and delayed motor and cognitive milestones are seen in this. Management is by shunting if hydrocephalus is present. The image below shows a sagittal section of the magnetic resonance tomography scan of a patient with Dandy-Walker syndrome.",

Any abnormality in the above process leads to neuronal migration defects. Neuronal migration defect includes the following: Schizencephaly: (schiz = split or cleavage) It is the presence of unilateral or bilateral clefts within the cerebral hemispheres. The patient can be severely intellectually challenged, with microcephaly, seizures, and spastic quadriparesis. The image below shows schizencephaly: Lissencephaly (agyria): It is the absence of cerebral convolutions. Rather than the normal 6 ayers of the cortex, there may be fewer layers.

Facial angiofibroma (adenoma sebaceum) is a feature of tuberous sclerosis (TS) and not neurofibromatosis. The image below shows facial angiofibroma seen in tuberous sclerosis (Bourneville disease). Lisch nodules are specifically associated with NF-1 and are usually multiple and bilateral. They are best visualized with a slit lamp examination and don’t cause any visual disturbances. Other important ocular manifestations in NF-1 include eyelid plexiform neurofibroma, which causes S-shaped deformity of the upper lid, with a 'bag of worms' like texture, optic nerve glioma, and spheno-orbital encephalocele due to dysplasia of greater wing of the sphenoid. NF-1 (von Recklinghausen's disease) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a loss-of-function mutation of the NF-1 gene located on chromosome 17q11.2. NF-1 produces neurofibromin, which acts as a tumor suppressor and a negative regulator of RAS-MAP kinase signaling. Clinical features of NF-1 include café-au-lait macules, axillary freckling, Lisch nodules, neurofibromas, and optic gliomas. NF-1 is more common than NF2 and typically diagnosed in childhood.

Consciousness is usually preserved. Precipitating factors include sleep deprivation, alcohol, and photic stimulation. EEG shows 4 to 5Hz polyspike and slow wave discharges. A family history of epilepsy is often present. The treatment options for JME include sodium valproate, levetiracetam, and topiramate. Benzodiazepine, lamotrigine, perampanel, phenobarbital, primidone, and zonisamide can be considered as add-on drugs. Complete remission is uncommon and has a high risk of seizure recurrence, hence antiepileptics are continued lifelong in a majority of the patients. Other options: Option B: Atypical absence seizures have been associated with myoclonic components and head drop. They are precipitated by drowsiness and EEG shows 1 to 2 Hz spike and slow wave discharges. Option D: In benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, the child typically wakes at night due to a focal seizure with preserved awareness. Buccal and throat tingling and tonic or clonic contractions on one side of the face are seen, with drooling and preserved consciousness. EEG shows typical wide-based centrotemporal spikes.",

Close contacts of individuals with confirmed meningococcal disease are at an increased risk of developing the illness. Prophylaxis is also offered to individuals with direct and prolonged contact with a case of meningococcal disease. Antibiotics are effective in preventing additional cases by eradicating the carriage of the invasive strain. Treatment is provided to the contacts within 24 hours of identification of the index case. The antibiotics effective include rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. Prophylaxis is not generally recommended for medical personnel, except in cases where there is exposure to aerosols of respiratory secretions, such as during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, intubation, or suctioning. This recommendation applies within 24 hours before or after the initiation of antibiotic therapy in the index case. For the treatment of cases, penicillin is the preferred drug, but ceftriaxone or other third-generation cephalosporins are recommended for patients with penicillin allergy. Droplet infection control precautions should be followed for hospitalized patients for 24 hours after effective therapy has been initiated. Offering quadrivalent meningococcal A, C, W, Y conjugate vaccines in addition to antimicrobial prophylaxis can further reduce the risk of disease among close contacts of cases caused by vaccine capsular groups. Meningococcal vaccines are available in two forms: polysaccharide vaccines and polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines. Polysaccharide vaccines can be given as a single dose to individuals aged 2 years and older. They are offered in bivalent (A, C), trivalent (A, C, W135), and quadrivalent (A, C, W135, Y) formulations. Meningococcal conjugate vaccines are available as monovalent (A or C) or quadrivalent (A, C, W135, Y) formulations. Conjugate vaccines, which offer increased immunogenicity and potential for herd protection, are preferred over polysaccharide vaccines, especially in children under 2 years of age.

The recommended empirical antibiotic regimen in a suspected case of meningitis outside the neonatal period is vancomycin combined with a third-generation cephalosporin. Patients allergic to penicillin or cephalosporin can be treated with meropenem, fluoroquinolones, or chloramphenicol. Chemoprophylaxis with rifampicin/ceftriaxone/ciprofloxacin is recommended for all close contacts with meningococcal meningitis regardless of age or immunization status. Rifampicin prophylaxis should be given to all household contacts of patients with invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b, if an immunocompromised child of any age resides in the household or close family member younger than 48 months has not been fully immunized.",

A female pseudohermaphrodite is a genotypically normal female (46, XX), whose external genitalia resembles a male's. The image below shows ambiguous genitalia in a female with CAH: The mechanism underlying the endocrine defects in 21-hydroxylase deficiency is depicted in the image below: Babies with 21-hydroxylase deficiency typically present around 10-14 days of age with the subset of symptoms due to aldosterone deficiency, cortisol deficiency and androgen excess. Aldosterone deficiency leads to salt-wasting crises marked by hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis. Cortisol deficiency causes manifestations like hypoglycemia, hyperpigmentation, weight loss, weakness, anorexia, vomiting, and shock. Androgen excess in 21-hydroxylase deficiency results in virilization of females, leading to female pseudohermaphroditism, and precocious puberty in males. Virilization is usually apparent at birth in females and within 2 to 3 years of life in males. Without treatment, shock, cardiac arrhythmias, and death may occur within days or weeks. Other options: Option A: Male pseudohermaphroditism is seen in CAH due to 17-hydroxylase deficiency resulting in incomplete virilization. 17-hydroxylase deficiency is 2nd most common enzyme affected in CAH. Option C: True hermaphroditism is presently referred to as an ovotesticular disorder of sex development(DSD). Here, both ovarian and testicular tissue is present. It is not due to CAH.

Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia rule out CAH due to 17-hydroxylase deficiency and 11-hydroxylase deficiency. Infants with aldosterone synthase deficiency may have severe electrolyte abnormalities with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. Since cortisol synthesis is unaffected, infants rarely become as ill as untreated infants with salt-losing forms of CAH. So some infants escape diagnosis at birth because of normal cortisol levels.

Nelson's syndrome is a rare complication of total bilateral adrenalectomy (TBA). TBA is a procedure used to control hypercortisolism in Cushing's disease (due to ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma) when resection of the primary tumor is not possible. The loss of feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis following TBA increases CRH. This leads to stimulation of ACTH-secreting corticotroph cells, causing enlargement of the original pituitary tumor or formation of a new one. Nelson's syndrome is associated with a clinical triad of: Hyperpigmentation Excessive ACTH secretion Corticotroph adenoma Screening is done with fasting plasma ACTH levels and MRI brain performed at regular intervals. Prophylactic pituitary irradiation may be recommended to prevent its incidence. The primary treatment is transsphenoidal surgery. Patients will also require life-long glucocorticoid replacement, as they do not produce cortisol.

It is caused by end-organ resistance to growth hormone(GH insensitivity) due to the GH receptor mutation. It is an autosomal-recessive disorder with clinical features as those seen in pituitary dwarfism. Here, growth hormone is produced but is unable to act on the target tissues. Thus, the resting and stimulated GH levels are high and IGF-1 levels are low. In Turner's syndrome (Option A), loss of the short arm of the X chromosome is implicated in dwarfism. The short stature occurs due to a state of GH resistance, relative deficiency, and decreased utilization. Pituitary dwarfism (Option B) is a condition with GH deficiency. Maternal deprivation dwarfism (Option D) is due to psychosocial causes such as emotional deprivation and neglect. There is an inadequate response to GH stimulation tests. The mechanism is not fully understood. No history suggestive of disturbed maternal or family relationships rules this out.",

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia/adrenogenital syndrome is a family of autosomal-recessive disorders caused by the deficiency of enzymes involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones in the adrenal cortex. The majority of cases of CAH are caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This deficiency leads to a lack of synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone, resulting in the salt-wasting form of the disease, which is the most severe form. Severe 21-hydroxylase deficiency presents with symptoms including weight loss, dehydration, weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances. Accumulated steroid precursors like 17-hydroxyprogesterone, are shunted into the pathway of androgen synthesis leading to elevated levels of androstenedione and testosterone. This can result in abnormal genital development in affected female fetuses during early gestation. Females may have masculinized external genitalia. This can include enlargement of the clitoris, partial or complete labial fusion, and a shared opening of the vagina and urethra (urogenital sinus). Untreated individuals develop signs of androgen excess after birth. These signs include accelerated skeletal maturation, premature epiphyseal closure leading to stunted adult stature, excessive muscular development, the appearance of pubic and axillary hair, acne, and deepening of the voice. In males, enlargement of the penis, scrotum, and prostate. In females, the clitoris may become further enlarged. Diagnosis of confirmed by elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels. Glucocorticoid replacement with hydrocortisone is done. In a salt-wasting crisis, fludrocortisone supplementation is given.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common hereditary neuromuscular disease. It is an X-linked recessive disorder. In DMD, pseudohypertrophy of the calf muscles which occurs due to muscle enlargement by the infiltration of fat. It is paradoxically weak, unlike the muscle that enlarges due to hypertrophy. Pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles is the characteristic feature of DMD, whereas the other 3 conditions mentioned in the options do not have this feature. Clinical features: Progressive weakness with developmental delay Pseudohypertrophy of calves Wasting of thigh muscles Characteristic Trendelenburg gait or hip waddle. Gower’s sign Dilated cardiomyopathy Diagnosis: Elevated serum creatine kinase levels Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for dystrophin gene If PCR is normal, but clinical suspicion is high, muscle biopsy with dystrophin immunocytochemistry is done. Treatment includes supportive management for cardiac decompensation, nutritional management, physiotherapy, and glucocorticoids. Death usually occurs by 18 to 20 years of age due to respiratory failure, intractable heart failure, pneumonia, or aspiration. Note- The FDA has approved Vamorolone, a novel corticosteroid for the treatment of DMD. The rug offers enhanced anti-inflammatory properties and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism as well. It is potentially a safer and more effective alternative to glucocorticoids. Other options: Option B: Myotonic dystrophy presents with distal muscle weakness, proximal muscle involvement is very late. Option C: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), type 1 (which is most common) presents in infancy. Death occurs early. Option D: Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy presents with predominant involvement of scapular and humeral muscles. The given question describes the involvement of lower limb muscles.

Childhood form presents with fever, malaise, and rhinorrhea and is usually followed by severe pain, especially in the calves. The muscle pain is usually worse with movement and the symptoms last for about a week. In children, toe walking and wide-based gait may be seen because of the involvement of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscles. Other viral causes of myositis include HIV-1 (one of the most common causes of myositis), group B coxsackievirus (epidemic myalgia), HTLV-1 (Human T-lymphotropic virus), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Lab features of influenza myositis include elevated CK which may be as high as 500 times normal the value. Urine myoglobin is usually positive. Detection of the virus with PCR testing of nasopharyngeal specimens can be carried out but is not of much clinical significance.

Diagnosis is done by genetic testing for SMN gene mutation. Muscle biopsy is done for cases with negative genetic testing and strong clinical suspicion. The muscle biopsy in infancy shows a characteristic pattern of perinatal denervation that is unlike that of a mature muscle. Groups of giant type I fibers are mixed with fascicles of severely atrophic fibers. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recent updates: Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide approved by the FDA for treating SMA. It is administered intrathecally. Risdiplam (first oral drug) has been approved by FDA to treat infants >2 months of age with SMA.

Generalized hypotonia and weakness at birth Facial wasting and weakness Inverted V-shaped upper lip Loss of muscle mass in the temporal fossa Infants can require gavage feeding or ventilator support for respiratory muscle weakness or apnea. Other Options: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), type 1 (which is most common) presents in infancy with hypotonia but has no facial features that are present in this child. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the baby appears normal at birth and the facial features present in this child are not seen. Emery–Dreifuss muscular dystrophy presents with predominant involvement of scapular and humeral muscles. The given scenario makes this diagnosis less likely.",

Anti-Ro antibodies are used to diagnose neonatal lupus. Neonatal Lupus Erythematosus(NLE): NLE is not an autoimmune condition. It occurs when maternal autoantibodies enter the fetal circulation (passive transfer). The antibodies responsible for this condition are anti-Ro antibody (anti-SSA) and anti-La antibody (anti-SSB). The periorbital rash typically appears within 6 weeks of life and lasts 3-4 months. However, it can be present at birth. Infants may also have cytopenias and hepatitis, but the most feared complication is congenital heart block. Cardiomyopathy is seen in the most severe cases. The noncardiac manifestations of neonatal lupus are usually reversible, whereas congenital heart block is permanent. Conduction system abnormalities can be detected in utero by fetal echocardiogram beginning at 16 weeks of gestational age. Fluorinated corticosteroids seem to improve cases of hydrops. Significant conduction system abnormalities after birth are treated with cardiac pacing and occasionally intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids, while severe cardiomyopathy may require cardiac transplantation. Transient, noncardiac manifestations are conservatively managed, with topical steroids used occasionally to treat the rash. Other options: Anti-Jo antibodies are a type of myositis-specific antibodies. These are not related to neonatal lupus. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are specific for SLE (Systemic Lupus erythematosus). Anti-histone antibodies are present in Drug-induced SLE. Note: SS in SSA and SSB stands for Sjögren's syndrome-related. Anti-SSA and anti SSB are antinuclear antibodies and are mainly found in patients with SLE and Sjögren's syndrome.",

        "explanation": "The given clinical scenario showing swelling of knee joints (arthritis), non-blanching rash in the lower limbs (palpable purpura), along with hematuria and proteinuria (renal involvement) in a child is suggestive of Henoch Schonlein purpura (HSP). HSP (IgA vasculitis) is a small vessel vasculitis most commonly seen in the age group of 3-8 years. It generally follows an upper respiratory tract infection and there is a history of atopy in one-third of the cases. The pathology of HSP involves leukocytoclastic vasculitis and the deposition of IgA in the affected blood vessels. IgA is deposited in the glomerular mesangium in a distribution similar to that of IgA nephropathy. Clinical manifestations include palpable purpura, the hallmark feature of HSP, which characteristically involves the extensor surfaces of arms and legs. Musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthritis and arthralgia are common. Gastrointestinal symptoms can include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding. Renal involvement may lead to gross or microscopic hematuria, nephritic syndrome, or nephrotic syndrome. Renal manifestations are more severe in adults. A rapidly progressive form of glomerulonephritis is seen in some cases. Nephritis usually follows the appearance of the rash. Diagnosis of HSP is primarily based on clinical findings, including the palpable purpura, along with the presence of other symptoms. Laboratory tests are not specific to HSP but may show nonspecific markers of inflammation and sometimes elevated levels of IgA. Imaging studies and biopsies of affected tissues can provide additional diagnostic information Treatment of HSP is generally supportive, focusing on hydration, pain relief, and nutrition. Corticosteroids may be used in severe cases or for significant gastrointestinal involvement. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange are occasionally employed for severe disease. Nephritis due to IgA vasculitis should be treated with immunosuppressants like prednisolone and azathioprine. Complications of HSP can include serious gastrointestinal problems, kidney disease, and recurrences, but overall, the prognosis for childhood HSP is favorable. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and urine is recommended to detect and manage potential complications.",

There can also be gastrointestinal and pulmonary manifestations, with disease mortality related to severe neurologic involvement or rupture of vascular aneurysms. Dural sinus thrombosis is the most common CNS manifestation in children. Pulmonary aneurysms are the most severe feature of pediatric BD. It is associated with HLA subtype B51. T helper 17(Th17) cells play an important contribution in the recruitment of neutrophils, which will later infiltrate into the vessel wall.

This property forms the basis of the alkali denaturation test (or Apt test) to detect the presence of fetal blood in maternal circulation in suspected feto-maternal hemorrhage. The Kleihauer–Betke test (or acid elution test) is used to quantitate the amount of feto-materna hemorrhage to calculate the dosage of anti-D required in Rh-negative mothers. HBF accounts for ™0% of the hemoglobin at term. Increased HbF can be seen in hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia, HbC disease, and HbE disease HbF has a higher affinity for oxygen. This allows for gas exchange from maternal circulation by binding to oxygen at a relatively low oxygen tension in the maternal blood supplying the chorion. HbF has lower affinity for 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) than HbA. Lack of interaction between HbF and 2,3 BPG increases the affinity of HbF to oxygen.",

The types of disease include quantitatively deficient vWF (partial = type 1 or absolute = type 3) or qualitatively abnormal vWF (type 2 = dysproteinemia). The majority (~ 80%) have type 1 disease.

Ristocetin induces the binding of VWF to platelets and agglutinates platelets. Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a severe congenital platelet function disorder, is caused by an absence or severe deficiency of the VWF receptor on the platelet membrane. Hence, in Bernard–Soulier syndrome, no response (or no aggregation) is seen with ristocetin. The ristocetin-aggregation test is also abnormal in von Willebrand disease.

Factor XIII is responsible for the crosslinking of fibrin to stabilize the fibrin clot, symptoms of delayed hemorrhage are secondary to the instability of the clot. Typically, patients have trauma one day and then have a bruise or hematoma the next day. Results of the usual screening tests for hemostasis are normal in patients with factor XIII deficiency. Screening tests for factor XIII deficiency are based on the observation that there is increased solubility of the clot because of the failure of cross-linking. Pediatric Anemias",

Globin gene sequencing is used for its definitive diagnosis. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used as a screening test for thalassemia (option A). Thalassemia is a hemoglobinopathy that arises due to deficient synthesis of the globin chains. Depending on the chain affected, it is classified into -thalassemia and -thalassemia. -thalassemia is caused by point mutations of the -thalassemia gene on chromosome 11, whic diminish the synthesis of -globin chains. Splicing mutations are the most common cause of (+) thalassemia. There is a deficit in the synthesis of HbA with an elevation of HbA2 and HbF levels in -thalassemia. Children with severe thalassemia present with distinctive facial features such as maxilla hyperplasia, a flat nasal bridge, and frontal bossing. Other manifestations include pathologic bone fractures, significant hepatosplenomegaly, and cachexia. Blood smears show marked anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and microcytic hypochromic anemia. Target cells, basophilic stippling, and fragmented red cells also are common. A radiographic image of the skull shows the classic 'crew cut' appearance. Hb Electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are used as screening tests for thalassemia. DNA diagnosis to detect -thalassemia mutations is used for definitive diagnosis. The Mentzer index is the ratio of MCV to RBC count. It is used to differentiate between iron-deficiency anemia and -thalassemia trait. The Mentzer index is <13 in thalassemia minor syndrome. Transfusions are administered every 3-4 weeks to maintain a pretransfusion hemoglobin level of 9.5-10.5 g/dL. Transfusion-induced hemosiderosis is a significant complication in transfusion-dependent thalassemia. Iron deposition occurs in the liver, endocrine organs, and heart, resulting in complications including hypothyroidism, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, growth hormone deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and arrhythmias.

        "explanation": "The given clinical features along with the peripheral smear showing acanthocytes make the diagnosis of abetalipoproteinemia more likely. Abetalipoproteinemia is an autosomal recessive hemolytic disorder in which acanthocytosis is associated with fat malabsorption, progressive ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa. Acanthocytes or spur cells are spiculated red cells with a few projections of varying size and surface distribution. The most significant associations include abetalipoproteinemia and severe liver disease. Note: Do not confuse acanthocytes with echinocytes or burr cells. They appear with multiple small projections that are uniformly distributed on the red cell surface. It is a universal feature of uremia. Image: The peripheral smear below shows regularly spaced, smoothly rounded crenulations, which are characteristic of a burr cell. Peripheral smear in other options: Hemolytic uremic syndrome (option A); Numerous schistocytes and nucleated RBCs with extremely low platelets: Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (option B); bite cells or degmacytes or blister cells. In G6PD deficiency uncontrolled oxidative stress causes hemoglobin to denature and form Heinz bodies. Bite cells result from the removal of Heinz bodies by macrophages in the spleen. The image below shows bite cells represented by blue arrows, black arrows represent burr cells: Hereditary stomatocytosis (option C); Numerous stomatocytes (Uniconcave cup with mouth-shaped area of central pallor), caused by missense mutation in band 3 or AEP",

Goat’s milk is deficient in folate. So goat milk-fed infants are likely to develop folate deficiency anemia. Human breast milk, infant formulas, and pasteurized cow’s milk provide adequate amounts of folic acid. In folate deficiency anemia, lactate dehydrogenase levels in serum are elevated. Folate-deficient mothers do not give birth to infants with folate deficiency because there is a selective transfer of folate to the fetus via the placental folate receptors. Methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHFR) deficiency is the most common inborn error of folate metabolism, and severe cases can produce neurologic and vascular complications; there is no associated megaloblastic anemia. Malnutrition is the most common cause of folate deficiency in children. Note: Both homocysteine and methylmalonate levels are elevated in B12 deficiency anemia.",
