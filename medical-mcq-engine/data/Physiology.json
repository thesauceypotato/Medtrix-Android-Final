        "explanation": "Homeostasis is called dynamic equilibrium because the body maintains an internal balance within fluctuating limits. It describes the maintenance of nearly constant conditions in the internal environment despite changes in the outside world. A number of variables such as body temperature, blood sugar levels, blood pH, etc. are regulated within a range of values (homeostatic ranges) and not at fixed values. These variables are not given equal importance. There is a hierarchy of importance so that the constancy of certain variables may be altered markedly to maintain others within their normal range. For example, respiratory or metabolic compensation to maintain blood pH. The disruption of homeostasis either due to extreme environmental challenge or a breakdown of internal homeostatic mechanisms is termed as a disease.",

On the other hand, in feedforward regulation, the homeostatic responses take place before the change has occurred. This is done in anticipation of the change to minimize fluctuations. Examples of feedforward regulation include: The increased heart rate that occurs in an athlete just before a sprint begins. The smell of food triggers the secretion of salivary and gastric juices. An increase in insulin before glucose absorption has raised blood glucose levels.",

Positive feedback consists of changes that affect a variable to push it further away from a certain mean value. For example, an increase in LH leading to a further increase in LH.

Important for fast synaptic transmission. Examples - GABAA, GABAC, Nicotinic cholinergic, Glycine and Serotonin (5HT3 subtype). G-protein coupled receptors (Metabotropic receptors) When bound to these receptors, secondary messengers are released that modulate voltage-gated channels on neuronal membranes. Examples - GABAB, Muscarinic cholinergic, Catecholamines, Serotonin (all subtypes except 5HT3) and opioid receptors.",

This process is blocked by SGLT-2 inhibitors, leading to renal loss of glucose and improved glycemic control. A special property of the transport protein involved in secondary active transport is that a conformational change to allow Na+ movement to the interior will not occur until a glucose molecule also attaches to the transport protein. When they both become attached, the conformational change takes place automatically, and the Na+ and glucose are transported to the inside of the cell at the same time. The figure shows glucose is transported uphill and Na+ is transported downhill. Energy derived rom the downhill movement of Na+ is maintained by the Na+-K+ ATPase pump on the basolateral side.",

After an action potential reaches the terminal endings of a nerve, the influx of Ca2+ via voltage-gated calcium channels leads to the fusion of intracellular vesicles with cell membranes. This results in the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic space. This process will be impaired in the case of Lambert-eaton syndrome. Exocytosis is the extrusion of membrane-bound vesicles. In exocytosis, intracellular vesicles move to the cell membrane, fuse with it and then release their contents to the extracellular fluid. Solute and water can be released from the cell via vesicles by the process of exocytosis. Exocytosis can be: Constitutive exocytosis: Involves prompt transport of proteins to the cell membrane in vesicles, with little or no processing or storage Examples Goblet cells in the intestine continuously to release mucus Fibroblasts in connective tissue release collagen Regulated/ Non constitutive exocytosis: Here the proteins from golgi apparatus initially enter the secretory granules, where the processing of prohormones to mature hormones occurs before exocytosis Examples Endocrine cells, hormones are stored in secretory vesicles and released in response to a signal rom outside the cell. To insert proteins into the cell membrane like aquaporin insertion Note: The term ‘regulated exocytosis’ is misleading because even constitutive exocytosis is regulated. Exocytosis involves two families of proteins: Rabs, which help vesicles dock onto the membrane, and SNAREs, which facilitate membrane fusion.

Instead they are moved across epithelia by transcytosis. Steps: The molecule is brought into the epithelial cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The resulting vesicle attaches to microtubules in the cells cytoskeleton and is transported across the cell by vesicular transport. At the opposite side of the epithelium, the contents of the vesicle are expelled into the interstitial luid by exocytosis.

The Pyr enters the mitochondria and is metabolized via the citric acid cycle. The ATP formed by oxidative phosphorylation inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ channels, reducing K+ efflux. This depolarizes the B cell, and Ca2+ influx is increased. The Ca2+ stimulates the release o insulin by exocytosis. Glutamate (Glu) is also formed, and this primes secretory granules, preparing them for exocytosis. It is promoted by Ca2+,  K+ It is inhibited by Mg2+, K+ depletion.

When there is a concentration gradient for an ion across the membrane, the ion tends to diffuse down the concentration gradient. The electric potential that exactly opposes this net diffusion is called the equilibrium potential for that ion. This is calculated using the Nernst equation. It is expressed as the potential inside the cell (intracellular potential relative to the extracellular potential). To calculate the value of the equilibrium potential: Note: In this formula, the choice of concentration of the ion placed in the numerator and denominator does not matter because the formula is only used to derive the numerical value and not the sign ( +/- ). Mathematically, log (100/10) = 1 and log (10/100) = - 1. Hence, changing the numerator and denominator only changes the sign and the numerical value remains the same. This equation is used only to derive the numerical value of the potential. It is NOT used to derive the sign/charge (+/-). The sign/charge is derived from logic: In a positive (+) ion, if the concentration of the + ion is greater outside, then the + ion moves from outside to inside. The intracellular potential becomes more + relatively. Hence, the potentia will be positive. In a positive (+) ion, if the concentration of the + ion is greater inside, then the + ion moves from inside to outside. The intracellular potential becomes more - relatively (as + ion moves outside). Hence the potential will be negative. In a negative (-) ion, if the concentration of the - ion is greater outside, then the - ion moves from outside to inside. The intracellular potential becomes more - relatively. Hence the potential will be negative. In a negative (-) ion, if the concentration of the - ion is greater inside, then the - ion moves from inside to outside.

If a solute is a non-ionizing compound such as glucose, the osmotic pressure is a function of the number of glucose molecules present. NOTE: The body fluids are not ideal solutions, and although the dissociation of strong electrolytes is complete, the number of particles free to exert an osmotic effect is reduced owing t the interaction between the ions.

From a functional point of view, neurons generally have four important zones : A receptor, or dendritic zone, where multiple local potential changes generated by synaptic connections are integrated A site where propagated action potentials are generated (the initial segment in spinal motor neurons, the initial node of Ranvier in cutaneous sensory neurons) An axonal process that transmits propagated impulses to the nerve endings The nerve endings, where action potentials cause the release of synaptic transmitters The cell body is often located at the dendritic zone end of the axon, but it can be within the axon (eg, auditory neurons)",

        "explanation": "The conduction velocity of a myelinated axon increases linearly with diameter. Conduction velocity is increased by: Increasing the fiber size: Increasing the diameter of a nerve fiber results in decreased internal resistance; thus, conduction velocity down the nerve is faster. Myelination: Myelin acts as an insulator around nerve axons and increases conduction velocity. Myelinated nerves exhibit saltatory conduction. It is a rapid process that allows myelinated axons to conduct up to 50 times faster than the fastest unmyelinated fibers. Activity of the Na+–K+ pump does not directly affect the formation or conduction of action potentials.",

The entry of Na+ causes the opening of more voltage-gated Na+ channels and further depolarization, setting up a positive feedback loop. When the Na+ channels open, Na+ moves into the cell down its electrochemical gradient, driving the membrane potential toward the Na+ equilibrium potential. The process responsible for repolarization is the opening of K+. The K+ permeability becomes very high and drives the membrane potential toward the K+equilibrium potential by the flow of K+ out of the cell.",

Most of the increase in K+ conductance comes after the increase in Na+ conductance around the time of repolarization. During the early portion of the action potential, the sodium conductance is 1000 times greater than potassium conductance. Therefore, far more sodium ions flow to the interior of the fiber than do potassium ions to the exterior. This causes the membrane potential to become positive at the action potential onset. When the membrane potential rises from 90 millivolts toward zero, this voltage change causes a conformational change in the K+ channels which allows increased potassium efflux. Then, the sodium channels begin to close and the potassium channels begin to open, and potassium conductance begins to increase (and sodium conductance decreases). The increased flow of K+ out of the cell causes membrane repolarization. The slow return of the K+ channels to the closed state explains the after-hyperpolarization followed by a return to the resting membrane potential.",

Since the RMP increases, the cell interior becomes less negative. In response to a depolarizing stimulus, some of the voltage-gated Na+ channels open and Na+ enters the cell and the membrane is brought to its threshold potential. The entry of Na+ causes the opening of more voltage-gated Na+ channels and further depolarization, setting up a positive feedback loop. The rapid upstroke in the membrane potential ensues.

The entry of Na+ causes the opening of more voltage-gated Na+ channels and further depolarization, setting up a positive feedback loop. The rapid upstroke in the membrane potential ensues. The membrane potential moves toward the equilibrium potential for Na+ (+60 mV) but does not reach it during the action potential, primarily because the increase in Na+ conductance is short-lived. The Na+ channels rapidly enter a closed state called the inactivated state and remain in this state for a few milliseconds. In addition, the direction of the electrical gradient for Na+ is reversed during the overshoot because the membrane potential is reversed, and this limits Na+ influx; also the voltage-gated K+ channels open. These factors contribute to repolarization. The opening of voltage-gated K+ channels is slower and more prolonged than the opening of the Na+ channels. The net movement of positive charge out of the cell due to K+ efflux at this time helps complete the process of repolarization. The slow return of the K+ channels to the closed state also explains the after-hyperpolarization, followed by a return to the resting membrane potential. Thus, voltage-gated K+ channels bring the action potential to an end and cause closure of their gates through a negative feedback process.

Chronaxie is the minimum time (duration) for which a stimulus double the strength of rheobase has to be applied for excitation of tissue. Strength-duration curve gives the idea of the excitability of a tissue. Strength-duration relationship arises because the same minimum electrical charge necessary to excite an action potential can come from a current that is either brief but large or prolonged but small. It is the product of strength and duration that determines excitability, and thus these two parameters are inversely related in their effectiveness. Note: Chronaxie is a better index than rheobase and utilization time for comparing the excitability of a tissue.",

Conduction in the opposite direction is called antidromic. Under natural conditions, impulse conduction is normally only orthodromic. Antidromic conduction is usually only seen when a nerve fibre is stimulated under artificial conditions. In a chemical synapse, conduction is always orthodromic. As the transmission in a chemical synapse is due to the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic membrane which activate receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, antidromic conduction (i.e. from the postsynaptic membrane to presynaptic membrane) is not possible. Any impulse travelling in such direction would die as it encounters the first synapse.",

However, the earliest change in Wallerian degeneration after nerve injury is the degeneration of the axon distal to the site of injury (axonal degeneration) where there is a disruption of the retrograde and anterograde flow of signals within the axon. Wallerian degeneration If the axon is cut, the part distal to the cut degenerates; this process is called as Wallerian degeneration. Orthograde degeneration (Wallerian degeneration) occurs from the point of injury to the nerve terminal, interrupting neural transmission. After the injury, the membrane breaks down and the myelin sheath degenerates. The cell body of the injured neuron swells, the nucleus moves to an eccentric position, and the rough endoplasmic reticulum becomes fragmented (chromatolytic reaction). The nerve then starts to regrow, with multiple small branches projecting along the path the axon previously followed (regenerative sprouting). When the motor nerve to skeletal muscle is cut and allowed to degenerate, the muscle gradually becomes extremely sensitive to acetylcholine. This is called denervation hypersensitivity or supersensitivity.",

Sodium enters into the cell. The membrane reaches threshold potential. The sodium influx causes opening of more sodium channels through positive feedback mechanism. Rapid depolarization occurs. Sodium conductance decreases. Na+ channels close and K+ channels open. Repolarization occurs.

        "correct_option": "d",
        "explanation": "The tetanizing frequency of the muscle, based on the given diagram, is 20 per second. Tetanizing frequency = 1/contraction period. It is the frequency at which individual muscle fibres twitch that fuse and cause sustained muscle contraction, where the contraction period is the time taken from latent period to maximum force of contraction. In this case, the time tracer was taken using a 100Hz tuning fork. Which means the tracer recorded 100 waves per second. Therefore, the duration of each wave in time tracer = 0.01 seconds. In the image given in the question, between the point B (end of latent period) to point C (maximum force of contraction), there are about 5 waves. Hence, the duration of contraction = 5 x 0.01 = 0.05 seconds. Substituting the value in the formula, we get: Tetanizing frequency = 1/0.05 sec = 100/5 = 20/sec. Tetanization: The features of muscle contraction can be demonstrated by eliciting single muscle twitches. The adding together of individual twitch contractions to increase the intensity of overall muscle contraction is Summation. Summation occurs in two ways: by increasing the number of motor units contracting simultaneously, which is multiple ■ber summations. by increasing the frequency of contraction, which is called frequency summation and can lead to tetanization. When the frequency of a contraction reaches a critical level, the successive contractions eventually fuse together, and the whole muscle contraction appears to be completely smooth and continuous, this is called tetanization. Beyond this point, a further increase in the frequency, will not result in increased force of contraction. Tetanization occurs in two ways: Complete tetanus occurs when no relaxation occurs between stimuli. Incomplete tetanus when periods of incomplete relaxation take place between the summated stimuli.

The orderly arrangement of actin, myosin, and related proteins that produces this pattern. The area between two Z-lines is called sarcomere. The thick filaments, which are about twice the diameter of the thin filaments, are made up of myosin, which are lined to form A bands; the thin filaments are made up of actin, tropomyosin, and troponin. The array of thin filaments extends out of the A band and into the less dense staining I bands. The lighter H bands in the center of the A bands are the regions where, when the muscle is relaxed, the thin filaments do not overlap the thick filaments. The Z lines allow for anchoring of the thin filaments. Actinin, titin and desmin are additional structural proteins.Titin connects Z-lines to the M line and provides the scaffolding to the sarcomere. Desmin adds structure to Z-lines by connecting Z-line to plasma membrane. Note: Some sources say that even titin is a component of Z-disc so if alpha actinin is not given in the options titin is the second best answer.",

        "explanation": "Tetanic contraction occurs due to progressive accumulation of Ca2+ ions with rapidly repeated stimulation of skeletal muscle. With rapidly repeated stimulation, activation of the contractile mechanism occurs repeatedly before any relaxation has occurred, and the individual contractions fuse into one continuous contraction. Such a response is called a tetanus (tetanic contraction). A single action potential releases sufficient Ca2+ to cause a twitch contraction. However, the duration of this contraction is very short because Ca2+ is very rapidly pumped back into the SR. If the muscle is stimulated a second time before the muscle is fully relaxed, there is progressive accumulation of Ca2+ and the force of contraction increases. Thus, twitch forces are amplified as stimulus frequency increases. At a high level of stimulation, intracellular Ca2+ increases and is maintained throughout the period of stimulation, and the amount of force developed greatly exceeds that seen during a twitch. The response is termed tetany.",

Action potential in skeletal muscle: Motor-neuron discharge causes end-plate potential, which when reaches to a threshold value, causes action potential in the muscle fibre. The depolarization of the muscle fibre is caused by the activation of the voltage-gated sodium channels, which causes the influx of sodium. During repolarization, the sodium channels are closed, and voltage-gated potassium channels open, which causes efflux of potassium. The voltage-gated potassium channels close slowly. As a result, the potassium efflux continues, leading to hyperpolarization of the membrane. The steps in an action potential in muscle fibre and the neuron, are similar except for the quantitative differences, such as: RMP is -80 to -90 mV in skeletal muscle fibres, while it is about -70mV in neurons. The duration of the action potential in skeletal muscle is 1 to 5 msec, which is about 5 times longer than in the largest myelinated nerve fibre.

        "explanation": "During the contraction of the skeletal muscle, the Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Only statement 3 is correct. Excitation contraction coupling refers to the process by which the membrane depolarization of the muscle fibre (excitation) leads to the contraction of the muscle. The steps of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle are as follows: Motor-neuron discharge causes the release of acetylcholine at the motor endplate, which binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This causes increased Na+ and K+ conductance in the endplate membrane, leading to the generation of end-plate potential, which is a local potential. When the local endplate potential reaches a threshold for the muscle fibre, and an action potential is generated. The generated action potential passes inward through the T tubules, leading to the spread of depolarisation. The depolarization of the muscle fibre causes the release of Ca2+ from terminal cisterns of sarcoplasmic reticulum and diffusion to thick and thin filaments. The calcium released, binds to troponin C, uncovering myosin-binding sites on actin. The formation of cross-linkages between actin and myosin and sliding of thin on thick filaments causes contraction of the skeletal muscle. Steps in relaxation: The cytoplasmic calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, by the action of SERCA (sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase). Once the calcium concentration is lowered, the interaction between actin and myosin ceases, and the muscle relaxes. Other options: Statement 1: Incorrect - Extracellular calcium levels play an important role in muscle contraction. When there is a decrease in extracellular calcium as in hypocalcemia, the voltage-gated sodium channels are activated, which causes sodium influx. The increased intracellular sodium concentration causes sustained depolarization, which may lead to tetany. Statement 2: Incorrect - Ca2+ is not released from mitochondria. It is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Statement 4: Voltage-gated calcium channels on T-tubules (part of sarcolemma) are activated by a depolarizing stimulus, which causes the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The increased calcium concentration will eventually lead to muscle contraction. Muscle Physiology II",

The adding together of individual twitch contractions to increase the intensity of overall muscle contraction is Summation. Summation occurs in two ways: by increasing the number of motor units contracting simultaneously, which is multiple ■ber summations. by increasing the frequency of contraction, which is called frequency summation and can lead to tetanization. When the frequency of a contraction reaches a critical level, the successive contractions eventually fuse together, and the whole muscle contraction appears to be completely smooth and continuous, this is called tetanization. Tetanization occurs in two ways: Complete tetanus occurs when no relaxation occurs between stimuli. Incomplete tetanus when periods of incomplete relaxation take place between the summated stimuli.

Most of the synapses used for signal transmission in the central nervous system of the human being are chemical synapses. In these synapses, the first neuron (presynaptic neuron) secretes neurotransmitters at its nerve ending synapse. This transmitter, in turn, acts on receptor proteins in the membrane of the next neuron (post-synaptic neuron) to excite the neuron, inhibit it, or modify its sensitivity in some other way. As neurotransmitters are released only by the pre-synaptic neuron, the synaptic conduction in the CNS is only orthodromic (unidirectional).",

Most commonly activated is a G-protein coupled membrane receptor. The following four changes can occur usually after binding to a G-protein coupled receptor: Opening specific ion channels through the post-synaptic cell membrane. Activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the neuronal cell. Activation of one or more intracellular enzymes. Activation of gene transcription.

When the motor nerve is severed, there is a marked proliferation of nicotinic receptors over a wide region of the neuromuscular junction. Denervation supersensitivity also occurs at autonomic junctions. Smooth muscle, unlike skeletal muscle, does not atrophy when denervated, but it becomes hyperresponsive to the chemical mediator that normally activates it. This hyperresponsiveness can be demonstrated by using pharmacologic tools rather than actual nerve section. Prolonged use of a drug such as reserpine can be used to deplete transmitter stores and prevent the target organ from being exposed to norepinephrine for an extended period. Once the drug usage is stopped, smooth muscle and cardiac muscle will be supersensitive to subsequent release of the neurotransmitter. Option a) If the symapthetic nerve would have regenerated, both right and left eye would have been equally sensitive to the drug and so, would have dilated equally. Option b) Parasympathetic nerves supply the spinchter pupillae muscle. So, if stimulated they would constrict the eye not dilate it. Also, the drug added was a sympathomimetic agent. So, parasympathetic nerves are not stimulated in the first place Option d) If the left eye was damaged, it would also have denervation supersensitivity. Again, both eyes would dilate equally, but more than that of normal.",

The relief may result from inhibition of pain pathways (Inhibition of C fibers and A-delta fibers) in the dorsal horn gate, by stimulation of large-diameter touch-pressure afferents(A-beta fibers). This is called the gate-control hypothesis. Interesting clinical application: Touching or shaking an injured area decreases the pain due to the injury. Stimulation with an electric vibrator at the site of pain also gives some relief. The same mechanism is probably responsible for the efficacy of counterirritants.

Law of projection: No matter where a particular sensory pathway is stimulated along its course to the cortex, the conscious sensation produced is referred to the location of the receptor. Weber-Fechner Law: Magnitude of sensation felt is directly proportional to the log of the intensity of the stimulus. Labelled line theory: All the sensations from the different parts of the body travel along specified paths. For example, in the posterior column, fibers from the lower parts of the body are placed medially.",

It is nearly maximal in about 20 min, much longer than the time taken for light adaptation which is 5 min. When one passes suddenly from a dim to a brightly lighted environment, the light seems intensely and even uncomfortably bright until the eyes adapt to the increased illumination and the visual threshold rises.

This innervates both th nuclear bag and nuclear chain fibers. They are most sensitive to the velocity of the change in muscle length. This is called a dynamic response. (Option B) Secondary endings - from Type II nerve fibers. This innervates static nuclear bag and nuclear chain fibers. They do not innervate dynamic nuclear bag fibers. (Option C) Both primary and secondary endings show a static response. Motor nerve supply: The muscle spindles are supplied by  motor neurons.

It results in flexion on the ipsilateral side and extension on the contralateral side. Somatosensory and pain afferent fibers elicit withdrawal of the stimulated body part from the noxious stimulus. Pain (e.g., touching a hot stove) stimulates the flexor reflex afferents of groups II, III, and IV.

They prolong the reflex contraction of the muscles that last many fractions of a second after the stimulus is over. The flexor reflex is organized to withdraw a pained or otherwise irritated part of the body from a stimulus. Further, because of after-discharge, the reflex can hold the irritated part away from the stimulus for 0.1 to 3 seconds after the irritation is over.

When  – coactivation occurs, intrafusal and extrafusal fibers shorten together, and spindle afferent activity can occur throughout the period of muscle contraction. Stimulation of -motor neurons causes increase discharge in spindle Ia afferent, leading to reflex contraction of the muscle. When a muscle contracts it leads to shortening of the muscle spindles and so impulses in the Ia afferents decreases. Thus, muscles can be made to contract via stimulation of the  -motor neurons that innervate the extrafusal fibers or the -motor neurons that initiate contraction indirectly via the stretch reflex. If the whole muscle is stretched during stimulation of the -motor neurons, the rate of discharge n the Ia fibers is further increased. Increased -motor neuron activity thus increases spindle sensitivity during stretch. This is the basis of the Jendrassik manouver.",

This myogram demonstrates the relatively long latency before the reflex begins and the long after-discharge at the end of the stimulus. When a painful stimulus is applied to the body, the flexor withdrawal and the crossed extensor reflexes are stimulated. About 0.2 to 0.5 seconds after the flexor reflex in one limb, the opposite limb begins to extend. This reflex is called the crossed extensor reflex. After the painful stimulus is removed, the crossed extensor reflex has an even longer period of after-discharge than does the flexor reflex. This prolonged after-discharge results from reverberating circuits among the inter-neuronal cells. Compare the myograms of a flexor reflex with a crossed extensor reflex.

When the bulboreticular facilitatory region transmits excitatory signals through the gamma nerve fibers to the intrafusal muscle fibers of the muscle spindles, it shortens the ends of the spindles and stretches the central receptor regions, thus increasing their signal output. If the spindles on both sides of each joint are activated at the same time, then reflex excitation of the skeletal muscles on both sides of the joint increases, producing tight, tense muscles opposing each other at the joint. The net effect is that the position of the joint becomes strongly stabilized.

Sham rage is a controversial term used to describe behavior such as biting, clawing, hissing, arching the back and \"violent alternating limb movements\" produced in animal experiments by removing the cerebral cortex, which is claimed to occur in the absence of any sort of inner experience of rage. The reason for this might be that the removal of the neocortex causes a loss of inhibition of the areas involved in the rage reaction, causing those areas to become hyperactive (due to an uninhibited hypothalamus). Removal of hypothalamus abolishes the sham rage. Sham rage may be triggered by very mild stimuli such as weak touch. It is also non-goal directed.",

When the muscles are hypertonic, the sequence of moderate stretch leads to muscle contraction, strong stretch leads to muscle relaxation. Eg. Passive flexion of the elbow meets immediate resistance due to stretch reflex in the triceps muscle. Further stretch activates the inverse stretch reflex. The resistance to flexion suddenly collapses, and the arm flexes. This sequence of resistance followed by a sudden decrease in resistance when a limb is moved passively is known as the clasp-knife effect because of its resemblance to the closing of a pocket knife. Lengthening reaction: When the tension on the muscle becomes extreme, the inhibitory effect from the Golgi tendon organ leads to an instantaneous relaxation of the entire muscle.

Collaterals funnel into it from the long ascending sensory tracts, the trigeminal, auditory, visual, and olfactory systems. The reticular formation plays an important role in determining the level of arousal; thus, it is called the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS).",

The left hemisphere is also involved, but the role of the right hemisphere is primary. The presence of autonomic response to a familiar face in the absence of recognition has been explained by postulating the existence of a separate dorsal pathway for processing information about faces that leads to recognition at only a subconscious level.

        "explanation": "Among the given options, bronchi (medium-sized airway) offer maximum resistance. The best answer here is bronchi, as all the other options suggest smaller airways, while bronchi are the only medium-sized airway. Airflow can be derived from Poiseuille-Hagen formula: Q = Pr4/8L Where Q is the flow rate  is pie symbo P is the pressure difference r is radius  is viscosity L is length Also, Flow rate (Q) = pressure difference (P)/ resistance (R). Therefore, substituting this in Poiseuille- Hagen formula, P/ R =  Pr4/8 1/R =  r4/8 R = 8l/  r4 Therefore it can be derived that airway resistance is inversely proportional to the radius by the power of four. With Poiseuille- Hagen formula we might feel that the smallest airways are the major site of resistance. However, the contribution by the smallest airways is very little to the overall total resistance. This is because, the airway branches in each generation exist in parallel rather than in series. As the parallel branching increases, the resistance decreases. (Total cross-sectional diameter of small airways put together is high). Thus the overall resistance of the small airways is very small. Also, airflow velocity decreases substantially as the effective cross-sectional area increases (i.e., the flow becomes laminar). Other factors affecting airway resistance : Lung volume, as lung volume increases the resistance decreases and vice versa. Lung volume increases the transairway pressure thus increasing the caliber of the airway. Airway mucus, edema, and contraction of bronchial smooth muscle increase the airway resistance. Its clinical application is seen in asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema The density and viscosity of inspired gas also contribute to airway resistance. A gas with more density imparts more resistance.",

In accordance with Law of Laplace - P=2T/r, where P - Collapsing pressure on alveolus (dynes/cm2) or Pressure required to keep alveolus open (dynes/cm2) T = Surface tension (dynes/cm) r = Radius of the alveolus (cm). Collapsing pressure is inversely related to radius i.e. large alveolus (one with a large radius) will have a low collapsing pressure and therefore will require only minimal pressure to keep it open. On the other hand, a small alveolus (one with a small radius) will have a high collapsing pressure and require more pressure to keep it open. By reducing surface tension, surfactant reduces the collapsing pressure for a given radius. Option B: Surfactant deficiency is an important cause of infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) also known as hyaline membrane disease, the serious pulmonary disease that develops in infants born before their surfactant system is functional. In IRDS, there is high surface tension in the lungs resulting in atelectasis Also, there is retention of fluid in the lungs. During fetal life, Cl- is secreted with fluid by the pulmonary epithelial cells. At birth, there is a shift to Na+ reabsorption by these cells via ENaC and fluid is absorbed along with Na+. Prolonged immaturity of ENaC contributes to pulmonary edema in IRDS. Option D: Surfactant increases lung compliance, which reduces the work of expanding the lungs during inspiration. Increasing the compliance of the lungs reduces the collapsing force at any given volume so that it is easier for the lungs to expand.",

When water forms a surface with air, the water molecules on the surface of the alveoli have a strong attraction for one another. This pulls the molecules together, leading to high surface tension. The surfactant is amphipathic in nature (i.e., hydrophobic on one end and hydrophilic on the other). They align themselves on the alveolar surface, with their hydrophobic portions facing the alveolar lumen. The cohesive force between a water molecule and an adjacent pulmonary surfactant molecule is very low. So, they break up the attracting forces between water molecules lining the alveoli (which had been responsible for the high surface tension). Thus, they reduce surface tension.",

Whenever alveolar pressure equals atmospheric pressure, alveolar pressure is said to be zero. This happens when no air is moving in or out of the lungs. During inspiration, the diaphragm contracts, causing the volume of the thorax to increase. As lung volume increases, the pressure in the lungs must decrease. (Boyle’s law states that P × V is constant at a given temperature.) Halfway through inspiration, the alveolar pressure falls below atmospheric pressure (1 cm H2O). The pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the alveoli drives airflow into the lung. Air flows into the lungs until, at the end of inspiration, alveolar pressure is once again equal to the atmospheric pressure; the pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the alveoli has dissipated, and airflow into the lungs ceases.

        "explanation": "The transpulmonary pressure would be 12 cmH2O when she inhales 600mL of air. Transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) is the difference between alveolar pressure (Palv) and intrapleural pressure (Pip). It is given by the formula: Ptp = Palv-Pip. Inspiration causes a negative change in both the Palv and Pip. Lung compliance is the extent to which the lungs will expand for each unit increase in transpulmonary pressure. In a normal adult, the pulmonary compliance is 0.2 L/cmH2O or 200 mL/cmH2O of both lungs together. Hence, expanding the lungs by 200 mL of inspired air will require an increase in Ptp by 1 cm H2O. Given: Pulmonary compliance = 0.2 L/cm H2O = 200 ml/cm H20 Alveolar pressure at the beginning of inspiration = 4 cmH2O Intrapleural pressure at the beginning of inspiration = -5 cmH2O Volume of air inhaled = 600mL (0.6L) Step 1: Calculate the initial transpulmonary pressure (Ptp). Transpulmonary pressure = Alveolar pressure - Intrapleural pressure; Initial transpulmonary pressure = 4 cmH2O - (-5 cmH2O) = 9 cmH2O Step 2: ˜se the lung compliance formula to find the change in transpulmonary pressure. Lung compliance = Change in volume / Change in transpulmonary pressure. Pulmonary compliance is 0.2 L/cmH2O or 200 mL/cmH2O. Hence, to expand the lungs by 200 mL of inspired air, it will require an increase in Ptp by 1 cm H2O. So, for 600 ml inspired air, the compliance is = 600 mL / 200 mL/cm H2O = 3 cmH2O Step 3: Calculate the transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) after inhaling 600mL of air. During inspiration, the alveolar pressure (Palv) decreases, and the intrapleural pressure (Pip) becomes more negative. Final transpulmonary pressure = Initial transpulmonary pressure + change in transpulmonary pressure; Final transpulmonary pressure = 9 cmH2O + 3 cmH2O = 12 cmH2O.",

But, in the case of the saline solution-filled lungs, there is no air–fluid interface and there is no surface tension, making it more compliant. Hence, the pressure–volume curve obtained with saline measures only the tissue elasticity. The difference in the curves generated during inflation and deflation, termed hysteresis, is not present in the saline-generated curves.",

For this reason, the term specific compliance is often used to denote compliance with reference to the original lung volume.

At the apex (Against gravity): Both ventilation and perfusion decrease since the flow is against gravity. But, a decrease in perfusion is higher than the decrease in ventilation. Hence, ratio increases (3.2). At the base of lung: Both ventilation and perfusion increase since the flow is towards gravity. Increase in perfusion is more than increase in ventilation, i.e., denominator increases. Hence, ratio decreases to 0.6. The average value of V/Q ratio throughout lungs is 0.8. Important points: If the effect of gravity is eliminated, as in the supine position, the value is the same in all parts of the lung = 0.8. V/Q ratio is infinity when perfusion is zero as in case of pulmonary embolism. V/Q ratio is zero when ventilation is zero like in case of foreign body obstruction.

Ventilation increases abruptly at the onset of exercise due to psychic stimuli and afferent impulses from proprioceptors in muscles, tendons, and joints. This is followed by a brief pause and then a gradual increase in ventilation. This gradual increase in ventilation is believed to be due to multiple factors such as an increase in body temperature, increase in plasma K+ level stimulating peripheral chemoreceptors, or the sensitivity of the neurons controlling the response to CO2. In strenuous exercise, at a certain point, the O2 uptake reaches its maximum levels, beyond which it cannot increase further. This leads to a rise in blood lactate levels. Buffering of lactic acid liberates CO2 which further increases ventilation. The increased production of lactic acid, increase in ventilation and CO2 production are proportional, and alveolar and arterial CO2 changes little to nil. This is called isocapnic buffering.

Thus the partial pressure of CO doesn't rise (Only dissolved form of gas can increase the partial pressure, Gas which combines with Hb or plasma proteins cannot). Partial pressure gradient necessary for diffusion of CO is maintained for the whole 0.75s and hence it is Diffusion limited. In the case of N2O it does not react and reaches equilibrium in about 0.1s. The amount of N2O taken up is not limited by diffusion but by the amount of blood flowing through the pulmonary capillaries; that is, it is Flow-limited. O2 is intermediate between N2O and CO; it is taken up by haemoglobin, but much less avidly than CO, and it reaches equilibrium with capillary blood in about 0.3 s. Thus, its uptake is Perfusion-limited. In the case of perfusion limited gases, an increase in pulmonary blood flow increases the amount of gas transferred.

When the metabolic activity of tissues increases, the production of CO2 increases.

This decreases the affinity of Hb for O2, shifting the O2- hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right. This facilitates the unloading of O2 in the tissues. The effect of Pco2 and pH on O2 hemoglobin dissociation curve is called the Bohr Effect. Conversely, in the lungs, CO2 diffuses from the blood to the alveoli and the H+ concentration decreases and theO2 hemoglobin dissociation curve shifts to the left increasing the affinity of Hb to O2. Note: Double Bohr effect occurring in the placenta: Oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve of fetal blood and maternal blood move in opposite directions. Mechanism: The fetal blood entering the placenta carries large amounts of carbon dioxide, but most of it diffuse from the fetal blood into the maternal blood. Fetal blood - loss of CO2 - reduced H+ - shift to left - loading of O2 i.e. oxygenation of fetal Hb. Maternal blood - increase in CO2 - increase in H+ - shift to the right - Release of oxygen.",

This modification results in increased affinity of hemoglobin for O2, a left shift of the O2-hemoglobin dissociation curve, and decreased P50. The mechanism of the left shift is based on the binding of 2,3-DPG. 2,3-DPG does not bind as avidly to the  chains of HbF as it binds to the  chains of hemoglobin A. When less 2,3-DPG is bound, the affinity for O2 increases and facilitates the movement of O2 from the mother to the fetus.

Chloride shift: Upon entering the red blood cell, CO2 is rapidly hydrated to H2CO3 by carbonic anhydrase. H2CO3 is in equilibrium with H+ and its conjugate base, HCO3-. H+ can interact with deoxyhemoglobin, whereas HCO3- can be transported outside of the cell via anion exchanger 1 (AE1 or Band 3). In effect, for each CO2 molecule that enters the red cell, there is an additional HCO3- or Cl- in the cell. Because of this chloride shift, the Cl – content of the red cells in venous blood is significantly greater than that in arterial blood. Note that for each CO2 molecule added to a red cell, there is an increase of one osmotically active particles in the cell - either a HCO 3 – or a Cl – ion. Consequently, the red cells take up water and increase in size.",

Therefore, an increase in 2,3 DPG causes increased release of O2 to the tissues. The equilibrium between Hb and O2 can be understood from the following equation: HbO2 + 2,3-DPG ■ Hb2,3-DPG + O2 In stored blood, the 2,3 DPG levels usually fall. As a result, stored blood releases less oxygen to the tissues than the normal circulating blood, thus limiting its use in hypoxic patients (Eg: anaemia). However, such a fall in 2,3 DPG is less when it is stored in a phosphate-containing solution like CPDA (Citrate, phosphate, dextrose, adenine), rather than ACD (Acid citrate dextrose). Therefore, the blood stored in CPDA, in comparison with blood stored in ACD has: Higher 2,3 DPG concentration More amount of deoxygenated blood bound to 2,3 DPG Decreased affinity of Hb to the oxygen.

The equation used for the calculation of total/physiological dead space is the Bohr’s equation. The patient takes a deep breath of O2 From mid-inspiration, then exhales steadily. The changes in the N2 concentration of expired gas during expiration are plotted. Region I - Dead Space (DS) From I–II is a mixture of DS and alveolar gas. The transition from III-IV is the closing volume (CV). End of IV - Residual Volume (RV). Factors affecting dead space: Option B: Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) is measured using body plethysmography. Option C: Tidal volume (TV) is measured using spirometry.

Maximum expiratory flow volume (MEFV): When a person expires with great force, the expiratory airflow reaches a maximum flow beyond which the flow cannot be increased anymore, even with greatly increased additional force. In obstructive airway disease like Emphysema, it is usually much more difficult to expire than to inspire because the closing tendency of the airways is greatly increased by the extra positive pressure during expiration. Due to the obstruction of the airways and because they collapse more easily than normal airways, the maximum expiratory flow rate is greatly reduced (But, total lung capacity and residual volume is increased) which is shown in the green curve below. Other options given above will cause constricted lungs where the lungs cannot expand to a normal maximum volume. Hence, even with the greatest possible expiratory effort, the maximum expiratory flow rate will be reduced.

The total lung capacity is usually normal in chronic bronchitis, while increased in emphysema. Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) is the volume of air present in the lungs at the end of passive expiration. In COPD, FRC is increased. Lung Capacities: The total lung capacity can be broken down into alternative capacities that help to define functioning lungs. The vital lung capacity refers to the maximum amount of air expired from the fully inflated lung or maximum inspiratory level. The inspiratory capacity is the maximum amount of air inspired from the end-expiratory level. The functional residual capacity represents the volume of the air remaining in the lungs after expiration of a normal breath.

        "explanation": "Hypoxic hypoxia is characterized by low partial pressure of O2 in arterial blood (Pao2), while other parameters like partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood (Paco2) may remain normal. Ventilation–Perfusion Imbalance: The patchy ventilation–perfusion imbalance is the most common cause of hypoxic hypoxia or hypoxemia. If alveoli are not ventilated but perfusion is present - blood passing through that alveoli remains unoxygenated. When this unoxygenated blood mixes with blood from normal or overventilated alveoli, there is a right to left shunt created. This results in reduced partial pressure of O2 in arterial blood (PaO2) i.e., hypoxemia and consequently hypoxia. Note: Hypoxemia can be defined as a condition where arterial oxygen tension or partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is below normal. Hypoxia is defined as the reduction of oxygen supply at the tissue level, which is not measured directly by a laboratory value. Scenario 1: Generally, the presence of hypoxemia suggests hypoxia i.e. if there is less oxygen in blood, O2 supply to tissues will also be reduced. But, in case of cyanide poisoning, there is hypoxia in the absence of hypoxemia, i.e., arterial O2 content is normal but tissues are not able to utilize it because cyanide interferes with aerobic metabolism in the tissues. Scenario 2: Hypoxia may not be present in patients with hypoxemia if the patient compensates for a low PaO2 by increasing oxygen delivery. This is typically achieved by increasing cardiac output (by raising the heart rate) or decreasing tissue oxygen consumption. Nevertheless, hypoxemia is definitely the most common cause of tissue hypoxia, and the correct diagnosis should be made because it is readily treatable.",

Histotoxic hypoxia will lead to metabolic acidosis that will lead to an increase in H+ concentration, which in turn will stimulate the peripheral chemoreceptors. Hemorrhage that produces hypotension leads to chemoreceptor stimulation due to decreased blood flow to the chemoreceptors and consequent stagnant anoxia of these organs. Note: In case of stagnant hypoxia, chemoreceptors can be stimulated if the resultant decreased oxygen delivery causes a significant drop in local tissue oxygen levels, which eventually can lower the PaO2 detectable by chemoreceptors. Therefore, they may not be significantly stimulated unless the reduction in oxygen levels is severe. Therefore, anaemic hypoxia is a better answer.",

Hence, supplemental O2 can be very beneficial when the cause of hypoxia is due to limited oxygen availability. Administration of oxygen-rich gas has limited value in anemic, histotoxic, and stagnant hypoxia because: Anemic hypoxia- Oxygen delivery is not beneficial because despite increasing the exogenous oxygen delivery, an anemic person will not have the capacity to carry more oxygen due to the hemoglobin/ red blood cell deficit in anemia. Histotoxic hypoxia- The most common example is cyanide poisoning. Cyanide inhibits important enzymes in the oxidative phosphorylation process, which is essential to the survival of our cells. Additional oxygen supplementation will not be able to overcome this inhibition, and so it will have limited benefit. Hyperbaric oxygen may be helpful to some extent. Stagnant hypoxia- Stagnant hypoxia refers to ischemic hypoxia that results from inadequate circulation due to conditions such as heart failure and hypoxia in the setting of shock. In such conditions, administering intravenous fluids can improve the patient's condition because it is the circulation that is affected. If the shock is prolonged it can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can be treated with positive pressure ventilation and not simply by increasing oxygen administration.",

Treatment of anemia is more beneficial than providing oxygen to an anemic patient. Option B: With COPD there is CO2 retention due to difficulty in the expiration, and there will be a decreased Po2. So, there is a change in the regulation of respiration (drive for ventilation) from being under CO2 control to being driven by the decrease in O2.

It can be seen in Divers ascending rapidly from deep-sea (high pressure) to the surface of the earth (low pressure) Pilots traveling in unpressurized aircraft or mountaineers, rapidly ascending from the surface of the earth (high-pressure zone) to a high altitude (low-pressure zone). Under high-pressure, gases get compressed and their solubility increases. When a person is in a high-pressure zone like the deep sea for a long time, an increased amount of nitrogen gets dissolved in his or her body. If the person suddenly comes back to an area of atmospheric pressure or a low-pressure zone, the gases escape from a dissolved state and form bubbles. These bubbles are almost entirely made of nitrogen. The bubbles can plug many small blood vessels in different tissues.",

Concept: Below the sea level, atmospheric pressure increases at the rate of 1 atm for every 33 feet depth. According to Boyle’s law, as pressure increases, volume decreases. Hence, lungs tend to collapse. To prevent this and to keep lung expanded, gas is delivered at high pressure to the lungs. According to Dalton’s law, nitrogen contributes the maximum to barometric pressure and hence the amount of nitrogen entering alveoli increases. Henry’s law: As the partial pressure of nitrogen in alveoli increases, its concentration in blood also increases (dissolved form). Nitrogen is 5 times more soluble in fat compared to water. As a result, nitrogen dissolves in the fatty substances in neuronal membranes, and because of its hysical effect on altering ionic conductance through the membranes, it reduces neuronal excitability and produces the narcotic effect.",

On ascension to higher altitudes over a period of days rather than a period of hours, the ability to breathe much more deeply and withstand lower atmospheric O2 concentrations is improved. This phenomenon is called acclimatization. Variation of pH in Acclimatization: Immediate exposure to low pO2 stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors. This increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large quantities of CO2, reducing the pCO2 and increases the pH of the body fluids. These changes inhibit the brain stem respiratory center and thereby oppose the effect of low PO2 to stimulate respiration through the peripheral arterial chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies. There is a reduction of bicarbonate ion concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, as well as in the brain tissues. This reduction, in turn, decreases the pH in the fluids surrounding the chemosensitive neurons of the respiratory center, thus increasing the respiratory stimulatory activity of the center. An important mechanism for the gradual decrease in bicarbonate concentration is compensation by the kidneys for the respiratory alkalosis. Gradually, the metabolic compensation of the kidney will shift the pH towards normal.",

A note on inspiratory ramp signal: The neural signals transmitted to the inspiratory muscle, mainly the diaphragm, is not the instantaneous burst of action potentials. Instead, it begins weakly and increases steadily in a ramped manner. The advantage of the ramp is that it causes a steady increase in the volume of the lungs during inspiration, rather than inspiratory gasps.

Peripheral chemoreceptors are responsive to changes in arterial O2, CO2, and H+ ions. They are excited by a decrease in arterial O2. However, a graph plotted between the rate of firing of afferent neurons in the chemoreceptor vs. arterial pO2 shows they are most sensitive to changes in pO2 of less than 60mmHg. Thus, ventilation is driven by pCO2 and H+ under normoxic conditions. Other options : Option B: Peripheral chemoreceptors respond to changes in blood pH. They are excited by a increase in H+ ions (i.e decrease in pH) Option C: The response of peripheral chemoreceptors to changes in Pco2 is faster than that of central chemoreceptors. Increase in arterial pCO2 stimulates respiration. However, the stimulation by way of peripheral chemoreceptors occurs 5 times as rapidly as that from central chemoreceptors.

This signal inhibits the inspiratory ramp signals of the dorsal respiratory group of neurons (DRG), thus, inspiration is quickly inhibited and expiration follows. Advantages of Hering-Breuer inflation reflex: It cuts down the inspiration time, and therefore, It prevents overinflation of the lungs. Lungs operate at lower lung volumes, thereby preventing wastage of energy. The Hering-Breuer reflex is activated when the lung volume increases to more than three times the normal tidal volume (tidal volume = 0.5 liters/breath; So, lung volume > 1.5 liters per breath activates the reflex).

Option A: The brain, upon transmitting motor impulses to the exercising muscles, is believed to transmit collateral impulses into the brainstem at the same time to excite the respiratory center. This action is analogous to the stimulation of the vasomotor center of the brain stem during exercise that causes a simultaneous increase in arterial pressure. Option B: The Po2 of mixed venous blood does fall, but there are no known chemoreceptors that are stimulated as a result. Option C: Two points are important regarding pH during moderate exercise: pH = pK+ log ([HCO3-)/ [CO2]) The pH of the blood is dependent only on the ratio of the amount of CO2 to the amount of HCO3-. The concentrations of both buffer components (HCO3- and CO2) are very large compared to the amount of H+ added to the blood during moderate exercise. Thus, any change in HCO3- due to the addition of H+ during moderate exercise is very tiny compared to the amount of HCO3- already present in the blood. Thus, the pH of blood during moderate exercise remains constant. When sufficient oxygen is not available during exercise, there is increased accumulation of lactic acid, which initially leads to an increase in PaCO2. However, this is counteracted by the stimulation of ventilation and as a result, PaCO2 is decreased. This provides some respiratory compensation for further lactic acid production and prevents a decline in blood pH. Thus, blood pH remains constant in moderate exercise.",

Respiratory responses to exercise During exercise, there is an increase in ventilatory rate that matches the increase in O2 consumption and CO2 production by the body. The stimulus for increased ventilation rate is the activation of joint proprioceptors at the beginning of the exercise. The mean values for arterial Po2 and Pco2 do not change during exercise. Arterial pH does not change during moderate exercise, although it may decrease during strenuous exercise because of lactic acidosis. On the other hand, venous Pco2 increases during exercise because the excess CO2 produced by exercising muscle is carried to the lungs in venous blood. Pulmonary blood flow increases because cardiac output increases during exercise. As a result, more pulmonary capillaries are perfused, and more gas exchange occurs. The distribution of V/Q ratios throughout the lung is more even during exercise than when at rest, and there is a resulting decrease in the physiologic dead space. The abrupt increase at the start of exercise is presumably due to Psychic stimuli Afferent impulses from proprioceptors in muscles, tendons, and joints. The more gradual increase in ventilation is presumably due to Increase in O2 consumption (Proportional increase) Increase in body temperature Increases in the plasma K+ level (Stimulate the peripheral chemoreceptors). Sensitivity of the neurons controlling the response to CO2 is increased or that the respiratory fluctuations in arterial PCO2 increase so that, even though the mean arterial PCO2 does not rise, it is CO2 that is responsible for the increase in ventilation.",

This reduced form of vitamin K needs to be constantly recycled back from its oxidized form for the reaction to continue. This recycling is done by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase. This enzyme is inhibited by warfarin. Hence, warfarin indirectly inhibits the -carboxylation of vitamin K dependent clotting factors - Factors II, VII, IX, X by directly inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase.

The principal reason for these vessels' relative invulnerability is their small diameter. The protective effect of small size, in this case, is an example of the law of Laplace. Laplace law states that tension in the wall of a cylinder (T) is equal to the product of the transmural pressure (P) and the radius (r) divided by the wall thickness (w): T = Pr/w As the tissue pressure is low, P is equated to the pressure inside the blood vessel. W can be ignored as well as capillaries are thin walled. Hence: P = T/r In a thin-walled viscus, P = T divided by the two principal radii of curvature of the viscus: P = T (1/r1+1/r2) In a cylinder such as a blood vessel, one radius is infinite, so P = T /r Hence, smaller the radius, lower is the tension necessary in the wall to balance the distending pressure.",

This high pressure then initiates another cycle, and the oscillation continues. II: Oscillation of the CNS Ischemic Response: The cerebrospinal fluid pressure is raised to 160 mm Hg --> causes compression of cerebral blood vessels --> cerebral ischemia--> CNS ischemic pressure response raises the arterial pressure up to 200mm Hg -->the brain ischemia is relieved and the sympathetic nervous system becomes inactive -->the arterial pressure falls rapidly back to a much lower value, causing brain ischemia once again -->initiates another rise in pressure.

Then efferent signals are transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves to increase heart rate and strength of heart contraction. Bezold-Jarisch Reflex: Activation of chemosensitive vagal C fibres in the cardiopulmonary region (e.g. Juxta capillary egion of alveoli, ventricles, atria, great veins, and pulmonary artery) causes profound brady- cardia, hypotension and a brief period of apnea followed by rapid shallow breathing. Cushing Reflex: When ICP is increased, the blood supply to RVLM neurons is compromised. The local hypoxia and hypercapnia causes an increase in discharge from the neurons, producing hypertension, bradycardia and irregular respiration.

Atrial contraction causes final filling of the ventricles (fourth phase of ventricular diastole) Atrial contraction is followed by the closure of the mitral valve, which causes the first-heart sound. This is followed by the isovolumetric contraction of the ventricle, which causes c wave in JVP, due to bulging of the tricuspid valve. This is followed by the rapid ejection phase of the ventricle. The T wave of ECG occurs during ventricular repolarization, which is followed by the opening of the mitral valve, followed by rapid filling phase of the ventricle (second phase of ventricula diastole). ’ote: Passive rapid filling occurs as the mitral valve opens just before atrial contraction occurs.",

        "explanation": "Phase 0 of pacemaker potential is initiated by opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The pacemaker potential consists of: Phase 0 - this is upstroke seen due to the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. This causes an influx of calcium leading to the upstroke. Phase 3 - This is followed by inactivation of the calcium channels and simultaneous activation of K+ channels. This leads to efflux of K+ bringing about repolarization. Phase 4- As the K+ efflux declines, a channel permeable to both Na+ and K+ opens leading to an influx of both Na+ and K+. This is the If channel. This is responsible for slow spontaneous diastolic depolarization. This accounts for the automaticity of SA and AV node. The slope of Phase 4 in the SA node determines the heart rate. Note: Fast voltage-gated Na+ channels seen in myocyte potential are permanently inactivated because of the less negative resting potential of the pacemaker cells.",

H+ is secreted into the lumen of the stomach by the H+–K+ pump in exchange for K+. HCO3– moves out of the cell into the bloodstream in exchange for Cl– (Cl––HCO3–exchange). This Cl– moves into the lumen of the stomach. H+ and Cl– combine to form HCl. As HCO3– is added to the venous blood, the pH of the blood increases. This is called alkaline tide. Eventually, this HCO3– will be secreted in the pancreatic secretions to neutralize H+ in the small intestine. Proton pump inhibitors inhibit H+–K+ pump.",

Because of this Na+ concentration difference, more Na+ binds to the SGLT on the luminal side. This increases the affinity of SGLT for glucose and glucose binds to it. Then, both the Na+ and glucose are transported together to the interior of the cell. Thus, glucose is absorbed in the intestine by secondary active transport. The energy for glucose transport is provided indirectly, by the active transport of Na+ out of the cell. The glucose moves out of the cell into the blood across the basolateral membrane by facilitated diffusion mediated via GLUT.",

        "explanation": "A patient with a BMI of 34 kg/m2 is categorized as obese. Leptin levels are high in obesity. Leptin is an appetite-suppressing hormone synthesized from adipocytes. The larger the fat stores, the more leptin is released into the blood. Leptin resistance in obese persons may be due to its failure to cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the hypothalamus to serve its appetite-suppressing function. Note: A recent study has indicated that triglycerides which are elevated in obesity, inhibit the transport of leptin across the blood-brain barrier.",

The Basal electrical rhythm (BER) also called slow-wave, is a rhythmic fluctuation of membrane potential in the gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It is initiated by the interstitial cells of Cajal. The membrane potential fluctuates between -65mV and -45mV. The BER is seen in all sites of gastrointestinal smooth muscle except in the esophagus and proximal stomach. The rate of BER in various sites is as follows: Stomach: 4/min Duodenum: 12/min Distal ileum: 8/min Cecum: 2/min Sigmoid colon: 6/min The BER does not cause contraction of the smooth muscle. However, when the BER is superimposed by the spike potentials, it increases muscle tension. Acetylcholine causes an increase in the number of spike potentials and muscle tension. Epinephrine causes a decrease in the number of spike potentials and muscle tension. Muscle contraction can occur only when the motor stimulus is provided during the depolarisation part of the BER. Thus, BER does not cause muscle contraction by itself, but controls the rate and organization sites of the muscle contractions, as in coordination of the peristaltic activity and setting the rhythm of segmentation.",

Slow waves, also known as basic electrical rhythm are partial depolarizations of smooth muscle cells, spreading along the GIT. They originate from the interstitial cells of Cajal. The smooth muscles are in a hyperpolarized state, having a resting membrane potential of -50 to -60mV. These waves are not action potentials themselves and they do not cause any contractions. Slow waves raise the membrane potential by 5-15mV, bringing it closer to the threshold enabling spike potential (true action potential) to occur. Therefore, they set the basic rhythm of GIT.",

Its main function is to clear intestinal contents and prepare for the next meal. Option A: Peristalsis is a propulsive movement, which consists of a segment of contraction behind and relaxation in front. Option B: Segmentation and mixing help in mixing intestinal contents with digestive juices and provides time for digestion and absorption. It consists of a segment of bowel contracting at both ends, and then a second contraction occurs in the center of the segment to force the chyme both backward and forward. Option D: Basal Electrical Rhythm is fluctuation in the resting membrane potential of smooth muscle cells of the intestine as shown below.",

It helps to clear the stomach and small intestine of luminal contents in preparation for the next meal. Gastric secretion, bile flow, and pancreatic secretion increase during each MMC. After ingestion of a meal, secretion of motilin is suppressed and the MMC is abolished. Each cycle of MMC has 3 phases Phase I - quiescent period Phase II - period of irregular electrical & mechanical activity Phase III - ends with bursts of regular activity Note: Disorders of MMC have been associated with gastroparesis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.",

Hence, the order of filterability would be: Polycationic > Neutral > Polyanionic, represented by A, B, and C in the graph shown. The glomerular filtration barrier consists of: Endothelium of the capillary Basement membrane: Lamina densa - electron-dense layer. It contains type IV collagen Lamina rara interna - contains glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate which has a negative charg Lamina rara externa - contains glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate which has a negative charg Layer of epithelial cells (podocytes) surrounding the outer surface of the capillary basement membran The capillary endothelium is perforated by thousands of small holes called fenestrae, which measure from 4 nm up to 8nm. Therefore, neutral substances with molecular diameters of less than 4 nm are freely filtered, and filtration of those with diameters of more than 8 nm approaches zero. However, in addition to the size of the particles, the filtration also depends mainly on the charge of the particle being filtered. The glomerular capillary wall consists of highly negatively charged proteins called sialoproteins, which repel the negatively charged substances (anions). The property can be studied by using charged dextran. When the filtration of the negatively and positively charged dextrans was studied, the results indicated that the negatively charged dextrans in the blood are repelled, with the result that filtration of anionic substances 4 nm in diameter is less than half that of neutral substances of the same size. This explains, why albumin despite having an effective molecular diameter of approximately 7 nm, has a very low filtration rate. Renal Tubular Functions, Urine Concentration and Dilution",

For substances that are actively reabsorbed or secreted, there is a limit to the rate at which the solute can be transported, which is referred to as the transport maximum. This limit is due to saturation of the specific transport systems involved. Normally, measurable glucose does not appear in the urine because essentially all the filtered glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. The transport maximum for glucose is about 375 mg/min, whereas the filtered load of glucose is only about 125 mg/min. With large increases in GFR and/or plasma glucose concentration that increase the filtered load of glucose above 375 mg/min, the excess glucose filtered is not reabsorbed and passes into the urine. When the plasma glucose concentration is 100 mg/100 ml and the filtered load is at its normal level (125 mg/min) there is no loss of glucose in the urine. However, when the plasma concentration of glucose rises above about 200 mg/100 ml, increasing the filtered load to about 250 mg/min, a small amount of glucose begins to appear in the urine. This point is termed as the threshold for glucose. Splay is due to separation between filtered load and exceretion. It occurs due to different transport maximums of different nephrons.",

After this point, no matter how much the PAH concentration increases, there can be no further increase in the secretion rate. Excretion. For a secreted substance such as PAH, excretion is the sum of filtration and secretion.

They detect sodium concentration of the fluid in the tubule (chemoreceptor). In response to elevated sodium, the macula densa cells trigger the contraction of the afferent arteriole, reducing the flow of blood to the glomerulus and the glomerular filtration rate. This happens as follows: When there is increased sodium, there is increased sodium-potassium ATPase activity which leads to increased ATP hydrolysis causing more adenosine formation. The adenosine receptors on the macula densa cells stimulate it to release more calcium, so that there is vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole, thereby decreasing the GFR. Lacis cells: Extraglomerular mesangial cells situated between afferent and efferent arteriole. Granular cells/JG cells: Modified smooth muscle cells of the afferent arteriole, they secrete renin.

It regulates ECF volume and Na+ content. Major stimulus for aldosterone secretion is Hyperkalemia. The functions of aldosterone are Na+ and H2O reabsorption, K+ and H+excretion. Option A: Angiotensin II acts on efferent arteriole. It causes vasoconstriction increasing BP. It causes constriction of efferent arteriole, increases filteration fraction, preserving GFR when RBF . Option B: ADH acts on principal cells in collecting ducts. It primarily regulates serum osmolarity. Stimulates reabsorption of water in collecting ducts via Aquaporin-2. Option D: ANP is released from atria and BNP is released from ventricles in response to  volume, it inhibits RAAS, relaxes mesangial cells and promotes natriuresis.",

        "explanation": "One of the initial events is the relaxation of the muscles of the pelvic floor, and this may cause a ufficient downward tug on the detrusor muscle to initiate its contraction. Micturition Reflex Micturition is fundamentally a spinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers and is subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition. These centers include trong facilitative and inhibitory centers in the brain stem, located mainly in the pon everal centers located in the cerebral cortex that is mainly inhibitory but can become excitatory. The micturition reflex is the basic cause of micturition, but the higher centers normally exert final control of micturition. Micturition Reflex is the result of a stretch reflex initiated by sensory stretch receptors in the bladder wall, especially by the receptors in the posterior urethra when this area begins to fill with urine at the higher bladder pressures. Sensory signals from the bladder stretch receptors are conducted to the sacral segments of the cord through the pelvic nerves and then reflexively back again to the bladder through the parasympathetic nerve fibers by way of these same nerves. (refer figure) As the bladder continues to fill, the micturition reflexes become more frequent and cause greater contractions of the detrusor muscle. Once a micturition reflex begins, it is “self-regenerative.” It is a single complete cycle of The progressive and rapid increase of pressure, A period of sustained pressure, and Return of the pressure to the basal tone of the bladder. As the bladder becomes more and more filled, micturition reflexes occur more and more often and more and more powerfully. Once the micturition reflex becomes powerful enough, it causes another reflex, which passe through the pudendal nerves to the external sphincter to inhibit it. If this inhibition is more potent in the brain than the voluntary constrictor signals to the external sphincter, urination will occur. If not, urination will not occur until the bladder fills still further and the micturition reflex becomes more powerful.",

The curve shows An initial slight rise in pressure when the first increments in the volume are produced(Ia); A long, nearly flat segment as further increments are produced(Ib); A sudden, sharp rise in pressure as the micturition reflex is triggered(II). The flatness of segment Ib is a manifestation of the law of Laplace. This law states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius.

In metabolic acidosis, HCO3- levels decrease. Hence, this is a case of metabolic acidosis. Step 3: As per Winter's formula, the expected respiratory compensation in metabolic acidosis can be calculated using, pCO2 =( 1.5 x [HCO3-] ) +8 ± 2 In this case, Expected pCO2 = ( 1.5 x [12] ) +8 ± 2 = 26 ± 2 = 24 - 28 mmHg The pCO2 in this patient is 18 mmHg, which implies there is an overcompensation of pCO2. This overcompensation can happen only if there is an additional component of respiratory alkalosis contributing to reduced pCO2.

It is then transported into the colloid through a pendrin (chloride-iodide) transporter Thyroglobulin synthesis: Thyroglobulin (Tg), is a large glycoprotein rich in tyrosine residues. It is synthesized by follicular cells. Iodination of thyroglobulin: This is regulated by the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) enzyme. TPO has three functions: Oxidation: TPO oxidizes I- to I2 (iodine) in the presence of H2O2 Organification: TPO links tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin with iodine (I2) to form monoiodotyrosine (MIT), diiodotyrosine (DIT) Coupling reactions: TPO combines iodinated tyrosine residues to make MIT + DIT = T3 (triiodothyronine), DIT + DIT = T4 (tetraiodothyronine) Storage: Thyroid hormones are bound to thyroglobulin and stored in the follicular lumen as colloids. The colloid has hormone reserves for 2-3 months Release: Iodinated thyroglobulin is taken up by the thyroid follicles via endocytosis and fuses with lysosomes. It is cleaved by lysosomal proteolytic enzymes into MIT, DIT, T3, and T4. T4 (80%) and T3 (20%) are released into the blood Peripheral T3 conversion: T4 undergoes deiodination in extrathyroidal tissue to form T3, which is the active form of the hormone",

This in turn causes the opening of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels and influx of Ca+. This ultimately leads to the secretion of insulin via exocytosis. Diazoxide keeps the ATP sensitive K+ channels open and prevents depolarization, resulting in a decreased insulin release. It is used in patients with insulinoma.

Glucocorticoids: Glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex elevate blood glucose by stimulating gluconeogenesis and inhibiting glucose utilization by the cells. Growth Hormone: The effects of growth hormone are partly direct and partly mediated via IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I). The growth hormone mobilizes FFA from adipose tissue, thus favoring ketogenesis. It decreases glucose uptake into some tissues (“anti-insulin action”), increases hepatic glucose output, and may decrease tissue binding of insulin. Note: Infusing catecholamine (Epinephrine) mainly promotes glycogenolysis and it is also associated with enhanced rates of aerobic glycolysis in skeletal muscles during exercise (resulting in adenosine triphosphate production).",

Enhanced uptake of glucose by the liver cells by increasing the activity of the enzyme glucokinase which causes phosphorylation of glucose after it enters the liver cells. Once phosphorylated, the glucose is temporarily trapped inside the liver cells because phosphorylated glucose cannot diffuse back through the cell membrane. Increased activity of enzymes that promote glycogen synthesis, like glycogen synthase. When insulin levels drop (Ex: Fasting), glucose phosphatase gets activated.

This ATP causes closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels and hence depolarization. This leads to opening voltage-gated calcium channels and Ca2+ influx. This stimulates fusion of the insulin-containing vesicles with the cell membrane and secretion of insulin into the extracellular fluid by exocytosis. Diazoxide keeps the ATP sensitive K+ channels open and prevents depolarization and subsequent insulin release.

Osteoclasts, in turn, cut the collagen in the bone, which is bound to calcium. This causes the release of calcium, phosphorus, and collagen breakdown products in the blood. Osteoblasts produce osteoprotegerin (OPG), or osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor, a cytokine that inhibits bone resorption by preventing interaction of RANKL with its receptor. PTH decreases the production of osteoprotegerin (OPG). Glucocorticoids promote osteoclast activity and increase bone resorption by increasing RANKL production and decreasing the formation of OPG.

During thyroid surgery, parathyroid gland is prone to accidental injury due to proximity with the thyroid gland. Damage to the parathyroid gland will lead to a low PTH level and low Ca2+ level. When the ECF concentration of Ca2+ falls below normal, the nervous system becomes progressively more excitable. Because there is increased membrane permeability to Na+. This leads to easy initiation of the action potentials. The peripheral nerve fibres become so excitable that they begin to discharge spontaneously, initiating impulses that pass to the skeletal muscles to elicit tetanic muscle contraction.

Option A: Total calcium concentration is altered by variations in the serum albumin concentration as 41% of calcium is bound to plasma proteins like albumin, hence changes in albumin concentration affects the serum calcium levels.

Spermiogenesis is a process by which there is a formation of extremely specialized mobile spermatozoa from spermatids. This process requires extensive remodeling or packaging of cell elements. It occurs in the recesses formed by invaginations of the sertoli cell plasma membrane. Maturation from spermatids to spermatozoa depends on androgen acting on sertoli cells. When sperm maturation is complete, the cytoplasm of the sertoli cell around sperm retracts and sperms are released into the lumen to be bathed by the luminal fluid. The following changes occur during the formation ofspermatozoafrom spermatids : The nucleus becomes eccentric and decreases in size, and the chromatin becomes condensed. The cytoplasmic content is redistributed and discarded. The acrosome buds from the golgi apparatus. The centrioles migrate to the caudal pole and form a long axial filament made of microtubules. This becomes the axoneme or major portion of the tail. Spermiation is the release of the sperm from the sertoli cells. During spermiation, most of the remaining cytoplasm is shed in the form of residual bodies. Spermatogenesis refers to the formation of spermatozoa from spermatogonia.",

Luteinizing hormone, secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, stimulates the Leydig cells to secrete testosterone. Follicle-stimulating hormone, secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, stimulates the Sertoli cells. Without this stimulation, the spermiogenesis will not occur. Estrogens, formed from testosterone by the Sertoli cells when stimulated by FSH, are also essential for spermiogenesis. Growth hormone is necessary for controlling the background metabolic functions of the testes. It specifically promotes early division of the spermatogonia themselves.

On coming in contact with the fluids of the female genital tract, multiple changes occur that activate the sperm for the final processes of fertilization. These collective changes are called capacitation of the spermatozoa, which normally requires from 1 to 10 hours. The following changes are believed to occur: The uterine and fallopian tube fluids wash away the various inhibitory factors that suppress sperm activity in the male genital ducts. While the spermatozoa remain in the fluid of the male genital ducts, they are continually exposed to many floating vesicles from the seminiferous tubules containing large amounts of cholesterol. This cholesterol is continually added to the cellular membrane covering the sperm acrosome, toughening this membrane and preventing the release of its enzymes. After ejaculation, the sperm deposited in the vagina swim away from the cholesterol vesicles upward into the uterine cavity, and they gradually lose much of their other excess cholestero during the next few hours. In doing so, the membrane at the head of the sperm (the acrosome) becomes much weaker. The membrane of the sperm also becomes much more permeable to calcium ions, so calcium now enters the sperm in abundance and changes the activity of the flagellum, giving it a powerfu whiplash motion in contrast to its previously weak undulating motion. In addition, the calcium ions cause changes in the cellular membrane that cover the leading edge of the acrosome, making it possible for the acrosome to release its enzymes rapidly and easily as the sperm penetrates the granulosa cell mass surrounding the ovum, and even more so as it attempts to penetrate the zona pellucida of the ovum.",

        "correct_option": "b",
        "explanation": "Progesterone is the dominant hormone during the luteal phase. The corpus luteum in the non-pregnant woman secretes large quantities of progesterone and a small amount of estrogen, as well as inhibin. In terms of ovarian function, the menstrual cycle may be divided into two phases approximately equal in length and separated by ovulation (Figure): The follicular phase, during which a mature follicle and secondary oocyte develop; and The luteal phase begins after ovulation and lasts until the death of the corpus luteum. Follicular phase (days 0–14) A primordial follicle develops to the Graafian stage, with atresia of neighboring follicles. LH and FSH receptors are up-regulated in theca and granulosa cells. Estradiol levels increase and cause proliferation of the uterus. FSH and LH levels are suppressed by the negative feedback effect of estradiol on the anterior pituitary. Progesterone levels are low. Ovulation (day 14) Occurs 14 days before menses, regardless of cycle length. Thus, in a 28-day cycle, ovulation occurs on day 14; in a 35-day cycle, ovulation occurs on day 22. A burst of estradiol synthesis at the end of the follicular phase has a positive feedback effect on the secretion of FSH and LH (LH surge). Ovulation occurs as a result of the estrogen-induced LH surge. Estrogen levels decrease just after ovulation (but rise again during the luteal phase). Cervical mucus increases in quantity; it becomes less viscous and more penetrable by sperm. Luteal phase (days 14–28) The corpus luteum begins to develop, and it synthesizes estrogen and progesterone. Vascularity and secretory activity of the endometrium increase to prepare for receipt of a fertilized egg. Basal body temperature increases because of the effect of progesterone on the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum regresses at the end of the luteal phase. As a result, estradiol and progesterone levels decrease abruptly. Menses (days 0–4) The endometrium is sloughed because of the abrupt withdrawal of estradiol and progesterone",

        "correct_option": "b",
        "explanation": "Progesterone is mainly responsible for the maintenance of endometrial thickness in the post-ovulatory phase. The menstrual cycle consists of three phases: the menstrual phase, the proliferative phase, and the secretory, or progestational, phase Menstrual phase: This phase is characterized by the discharge of blood and endometrial debris from the vagina. It coincides with the end of the ovarian luteal phase and onset of a new follicular phase. Withdrawal of progesterone on the degeneration of the corpus luteum (CL) leads simultaneously to sloughing of the endometrium (menstruation) and development of new follicles in the ovary under the influence of rising gonadotropic hormone levels Proliferative Phase: Thus, menstrual flow ceases, and the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle begins concurrently with the last portion of the ovarian follicular phase. When the menstrual flow ceases, a thin endometrial layer less than 1-mm thick remains. Estrogen stimulates proliferation of epithelial cells, glands, and blood vessels in the endometrium, increasing this lining to a thickness of 3 to 5 mm. The estrogen-dominant proliferative phase lasts from the end of menstruation to ovulation. Peak estrogen levels trigger the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge responsible for ovulation. Secretory or Progestational Phase: After ovulation, when a new corpus luteum is formed, the uterus enters the secretory, or progestational, phase, which coincides in time with the ovarian luteal phase. The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of progesterone and estrogen. Progesterone converts the thickened, estrogen-primed endometrium to a richly vascularized, glycogen-filled tissue. This period is called either the secretory phase, because the endometrial glands are actively secreting glycogen into the uterine lumen for early nourishment of a developing embryo before it implants, or the progestational (“before pregnancy”) phase, referring to the development of a lush endometrial lining capable of supporting an early embryo after implantation. If fertilization and implantation do not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates and a new follicular phase and menstrual phase begin again.",

This progesterone acts on the hypothalamus and increases basal body temperature. Charting the daily basal body temperature will show an increase of approximately 0.5 to 1&deg; fahrenheit shortly after ovulation. Since the rise in basal body temperature coincides with ovulation, abstaining from sexual intercourse until at least 3 days after the woman’s temperature has risen above her regular temperature significantly lowers the chance of pregnancy. Alternatively, using barrier methods (e.g. condom, diaphragm) during this time will prevent pregnancy.

Part of this stimulation of alveolar ventilation results from direct stimulation of the respiratory enter by nervous signals. An additional part is believed to result from sensory signals transmitted into the respiratory center from the contracting muscles and joint proprioceptors. During strenuous exercise, the utilization of O2 in the entire body can increase to 75% to 85%.

        "explanation": "The fall in blood bicarbonate levels is compensatory, and it helps increase the exercise effort, not hinder it. Adaptation at High Altitudes The work capacity is reduced at high altitudes and this reduction is in direct proportion to the decrease in O2 uptake. (Option B) Immediate exposure to low PO2 at higher altitudes stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors, and this stimulation increases alveolar ventilation. This immediate increase in pulmonary ventilation upon rising to a high altitude blows off large quantities of CO2, reducing the PCO2 and increasing the pH of the body fluids (Respiratory alkalosis). This raised pH inhibits the brain stem respiratory center and opposes the increased ventilation. So, respiratory alkalosis will hinder the maximal exercise effort. (Option C). To compensate for this respiratory alkalosis, kidneys reduce hydrogen ion secretion and increase bicarbonate excretion. This reduces plasma and cerebrospinal fluid bicarbonate concentration and brings the pH towards normal. This removes the inhibitory effect of alkalosis on respiration. Hence the fall in blood bicarbonate facilitates the exercise effort. NOTE Lactic acid causes extreme fatigue. (Option D) Ordinarily, the pyruvic acid from glycolysis enters the mitochondria of muscle cells and reacts with oxygen to form many ATP molecules. However, when there is insufficient oxygen (at high altitudes), most of the pyruvic acid then is converted into lactic acid, which diffuses out of the muscle cells into the interstitial fluid and blood.",

Nicotine paralyzes the cilia on the surfaces of the respiratory epithelial cells. As a result, much debris accumulates in the passageways, and this adds further to the difficulty in breathing. All these factors together make even a light smoker experience respiratory strain during maximal exercise, and their level of performance may be reduced.

Exercise also causes an increased venous return due to Increased activity of the respiratory pump Increased activity of the muscular pump Increased venous tone due to sympathetic stimulation Increased blood flow from arteries to veins In severe exercise, there is increased systolic and mean blood pressure due to vasoconstriction of the arterioles and small arteries in most tissues of the body increased pumping activity by the heart a great increase in mean systemic filling pressure caused mainly by venous contraction.

        "explanation": "During exercise, there is increased beta-adrenergic stimulation. Medullae of the two adrenal glands secrete large amounts of norepinephrine plus epinephrine into the circulating blood during strenuous exercise. The epinephrine often has a slight vasodilator effect because it excites more of the beta-adrenergic receptors of the vessels, which are vasodilator receptors, in contrast to the alpha vasoconstrictor receptors excited especially by norepinephrine.",

        "correct_option": "a",
        "explanation": "The respiratory quotient is 0.8. The respiratory quotient is the ratio of carbon dioxide production to oxygen utilization. In the given question, the CO2 production is 200mL/min, while the O2 consumption is 250mL/min. Therefore, Respiratory quotient = 200/250 = 0.8 The respiratory quotient (R•) is used for determining the metabolic utilization of various foods. When carbohydrates are metabolized with one molecule of oxygen, one carbon dioxide molecule is released. Therefore, the R• of carbohydrates = 1. When fats are oxidized, for every 100 molecules of oxygen consumed, 70 molecules of CO2 are released. Therefore, the R• of fats is 0.70. Similarly, the respiratory quotient for proteins is 0.80.",
