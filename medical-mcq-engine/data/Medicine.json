At extremes of high or low temperatures, like in Siachen, the axillary and the oral temperatures are highly misleading and should not be used to measure the core body temperature. The infrared tympanic thermometer measures the temperature of the eardrum which is representative of the core body temperature. However, it often ends up measuring the temperature of the ear canal. This is because of inadequate insertion into the ear canal due to poor manufacturing design or the presence of cerumen. Hence, it is not a reliable method of measuring the core body temperature.",

The tube is then gently inserted through the nostril and advanced until it reaches 10 cm. The patient is encouraged to swallow, allowing the tube to move down the esophagus with successive swallows until it reaches the measured distance. Subjective confirmation involves insufflating air through the proximal opening of the NG tube and listening for the sound of air in the left upper quadrant where the stomach is located. Objective confirmation can be obtained through pH measurement, chest or abdominal radiographs, ultrasound, or calorimetric capnometry. While widely practiced, blind NG tube insertion can lead to complications such as coiling of the tube in the nasopharynx, incorrect placement in the bronchial passage, or even esophageal perforation.",

This is often attributed to the enormous quantity of HCO3- present in the body and the ability of this system to accept protons and form carbonic acid (H2CO3). This further in the presence of carbonic anhydrase is converted to readily excretable H■O and CO2. It is therefore considered the most efficient extracellular buffering system in the body.

At this juncture, we have ruled out options B and C as this particular clinical scenario is not suggestive of a simple acid-base disorder. Step 3: Calculating the Anion gap: Anion gap = [Na+] – ([Cl-] + [HCO3-]) = 145-(100+23) = 22 mEq/L The presence of a high anion gap indicates that there's indeed an acid-base disorder, thus ruling out option A. A high anion gap indicates metabolic acidosis. However, HCO3- levels within normal limits suggest that there is also coexisting metabolic alkalosis in this patient. This can be confirmed by calculating the delta gap. Delta gap = AG - HCO3- In this scenario: Delta gap = (22-10) - (24-23) = 11 mEq/L Delta gap is > +6 suggesting the presence of metabolic alkalosis along with HAGMA. If the delta gap is significantly positive (>+6), metabolic alkalosis is present because the rise in the anion gap is more than the fall in bicarbonate. If the delta gap is significantly negative (<6) then hyperchloremic acidosis is usually present because a rise in the anion gap is less than a fall in bicarbonate. Alternatively, this can be confirmed by calculating the delta ratio. Delta ratio = the increase in Anion Gap / the decrease in HCO3- It is used in the presence of a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA), to check it is a ‘pure’ HAGMA or if there is coexistant normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA) or metabolic alkalosis. Delta ratio values: 1-2 indicates HAGMA < 1 indicates NAGMA + HAGMA > 2 indicates HAGMA + Metabolic alkalosis In this scenario, Delta ratio = 12/1 = 12 Thus, the acid-base disorder for the above scenario is HAGMA with metabolic alkalosis.",

Step 3: pCO2 is 16 mmHg indicating respiratory alkalosis. The decrease in pCO2 along with the decrease in pH suggests that this is a compensatory response. Step 4: The expected compensatory decrease in pCO2 can be calculated using Winter's formula (Expected PCO2= {[1.5 x HCO3-] +8} ± 2). Expected PCO2 = {[1.5 x 6] +8} ± 2 = 15 to 19 mmHg A pCO2 level of 16 mmHg falls within the range given above. Hence, metabolic acidosis is associated with compensatory respiratory alkalosis. (pCO2 values above or below 15 - 19 mmHg would indicate mixed acid-base disorders) Alternatively: The other method to calculate the expected compensation is a 1.2 mmHg decrease in pCO2 for every 1 mmol/L decrease in bicarbonate. The decrease in bicarbonate is 24 - 6 = 18 mEq/L Decrease in pCO2 is 18 x 1.2 = 22 Expected pCO2 = 40 - 22 = 18 mmHg (roughly = 16 mmHg since the standard values are approximations) This method also indicates primary metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.

Step 4: The expected compensatory increase in HCO3- can be calculated using the following formula: Increase in HCO3- = 0.4 š  PaCO2 (as COPD is a chronic condition and the presentation of the patient is not acute) Thus, the increase in HCO3- = 0.4 x (60-40) = 8 mEq/L Therefore expected HCO3- is 24 + 8 = 32 mEq/L.

Panic attacks are characterized by hyperventilation which leads to a washout of CO2 (reduced PaCO2). This further increases the ratio of bicarbonate concentration to PaCO2 and, thereby, increases the pH level causing alkalosis. Alkalosis promotes the binding of calcium to albumin and reduces the fraction of ionized calcium in the blood. This leads to hypocalcemia without reducing the total calcium levels. Thus, alkalosis can precipitate tetany and laryngospasm, especially in calcium-deficient patients. Induction of carpopedal spasm when the BP cuff is inflated 20 mm Hg over the systolic BP for three minutes or more is called Trousseau sign. It is a clinical manifestation of hypocalcemia.

The given arterial blood gas findings are suggestive of a partially compensated metabolic acidosis. The compensation is partial because the fall in paCO2 much lower than what is expected for the given HCO3 levels. The fall in paCO2 is inadequate due to hypoventilation causing decreased CO2 washout. In this case, the secondary disorder is respiratory acidosis. Hyperventilation causing increased CO2 washout (Option B) would allow for better compensation, with lower paCO2 levels than observed. The expected paCO2 can be calculated using Winter's formula: For metabolic acidosis, the expected paCO2 = [1 .5 š HCO3-] + 8 ± 2. Substituting the values, expected PaCO2 = (1.5 x 10) +8 ± 2 = 15+8 ±2 = 21 to 25 mmHg However, the actual PaCO2 is 30 mmHg, which is higher than the expected paCO2 indicating a secondary respiratory acidosis. A possible explanation for this could only be hypoventilation causing decreased CO2 washout. Thus, the given ABG findings are suggestive of a mixed acid-base disorder characterized by metabolic acidosis with additional respiratory acidosis. For example, in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis and pneumonia, the lungs would fail to compensate, and the patient could develop hypoventilation leading to secondary respiratory acidosis.",

In acromegaly or gigantism, GH secretion is autonomous and not suppressed by glucose. Thus, its diagnosis can be confirmed by demonstrating the failure of GH suppression with an oral glucose load (impaired oral glucose tolerance test). Galactorrhea is due to hyperprolactinemia and hypertension is secondary to increased aldosterone levels in acromegaly. GH leads to increased production of vitamin D3 which results in increased phosphate absorption from the intestine and decreased renal excretion. Hence there is increased serum phosphate level.",

Increased insulin-like growth factor-1 binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels can also be seen in patients with acromegaly. But they are not typically used as initial screening methods. Option D: IGF-1 levels are more reliable than random GH levels because GH secretion is pulsatile. IGF-1 levels reflect long-term exposure to GH and provide a more stable indicator of excessive GH production. Acromegaly is characterized by excessive GH secretion, usually caused by a somatotrope adenoma in the pituitary gland. It can also be due to ectopic GH secretion or hypothalamic tumors. The clinical presentation of acromegaly includes frontal bossing, increased hand and foot size, coarse facial features, mandibular prognathism, widened space between lower incisors and other manifestations such as soft tissue swelling, deepening voice, carpal tunnel syndrome, arthropathy, and acanthosis nigricans. It can also lead to cardiovascular complications (cardiomyopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hypertension), obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, an increased risk of colon polyps, and colonic malignancy. The primary treatment for acromegaly is surgical resection of GH-secreting adenomas. Somatostatin receptor ligands like octreotide and lanreotide, which suppress GH and IGF-1 levels, are used as adjuvant treatment or when surgery is not possible or unsuccessful. Radiation therapy may be considered for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to medical therapy.

The antidiuretic hormone (ADH) binds to V2 receptors in the late distal tubules, collecting tubules, and collecting ducts, and stimulates the movement of an intracellular protein, called aquaporin-2 (AQP-2), to the luminal side of the cell membranes. Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a condition in which there is the absence of or poor response to anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). This results in reduced permeability of the distal tubules and collecting ducts to water. This furthermore leads the kidneys to excrete large amounts of dilute urine that clinically manifests as polyuria and polydipsia. DI can be of four types : Note: Lithium - used to treat bipolar disorder, can cause acquired diabetes insipidus by decreasing the expression of the AQP2 gene. Option A : Liddle’s syndrome is due to an inherited gain of function mutation of genes regulating the Na channel in collecting duct ENaC, characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Option C : Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutation in CFTR gene that serves as a channel in the luminal plasma membranes of epithelial cells and regulates volume and composition of secretions in exocrine glands. Option D : Bartter syndrome is due to loss-of-function mutations of transporters and ion channels in thick ascending loop of henle, most commonly, Na-K-2Cl transporter.

The thyroid scan appearance in different conditions is shown in the image below: Diagnostic isotope studies, such as 99mTc-pertechnetate and iodine-123, are becoming less common in thyroid imaging because some warm swellings (5%) which are actually malignant could be mistaken as benign. Isotope scanning is most valuable when assessing a hyperthyroid patient presenting with a nodule or nodularity in the thyroid.

TBA is a procedure used to control hypercortisolism in Cushing's disease (due to ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma) when resection of the primary tumor is not possible. The loss of feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis following TBA increases CRH. This leads to stimulation of ACTH-secreting corticotroph cells, causing enlargement of the original pituitary tumor or the formation of a new one. Nelson's syndrome is associated with a clinical triad of: Hyperpigmentation Excessive ACTH secretion Corticotroph adenoma Screening is done with fasting plasma ACTH levels and MRI brain is performed at regular intervals. Prophylactic pituitary irradiation may be recommended to prevent its incidence. The primary treatment is transsphenoidal surgery. Patients will also require life-long glucocorticoid replacement, as they do not produce cortisol. The use of steroidogenic inhibitors in the treatment of Cushing's disease has decreased the need for bilateral adrenalectomy these days.

Tuberculous adrenalitis is still a frequent cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in developing countries like India. It is characterized by the loss of glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and adrenal androgen secretion. Glucocorticoid deficiency results in fatigue, lack of energy, weight loss, fever, myalgia, normochromic anemia, and hypoglycemia. Mineralocorticoid deficiency is characterized by nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, postural hypotension, salt craving, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. Adrenal androgen deficiency manifests as a lack of energy, dry itchy skin, loss of libido, and loss of axillary and pubic hair (in women). Hyperpigmentation is seen in primary adrenal insufficiency due to excess proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides. Hyperpigmentation is not seen in secondary adrenal insufficiency. The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency can be made with the short cosyntropin test (cortisol level <450-500nmol/L sampled 30 to 60 minutes after ACTH stimulation is diagnostic of adrenal insufficiency). Plasma ACTH, plasma renin, and serum aldosterone can help differentiate primary from secondary causes. Primary adrenal insufficiency will show elevated ACTH and a compensatory elevation in renin levels due to decreased aldosterone in the body. In secondary adrenal insufficiency, ACTH is low with normal renin and aldosterone. Treatment includes glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and adrenal androgen replacement. Other options: Option B: Patients with adrenocortical carcinoma present with features of glucocorticoid and adrenal androgen excess, and not adrenal insufficiency.

Glucocorticoid replacement - bolus injection of 100 mg hydrocortisone, followed by the maintenance dose of 100–200 mg over 24h.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is the most serious complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The symptoms include dehydration, nausea, vomiting, confusion, drowsiness, and coma in severe cases. In DKA, the insulin-to-glucagon ratio is decreased which promotes gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and ketone body formation in the liver. Ketone bodies exist as ketoacids at physiological pH which are neutralized by bicarbonate. As bicarbonate stores are depleted, metabolic acidosis ensues. Increased lactic acid production also contributes to the acidosis. The diagnostic biochemical criteria for DKA includes: Hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL) Venous pH <7.3 Plasma/serum bicarbonate <15-18 mmol/L Increased anion gap Ketonemia (beta-hydroxybutyrate [BOHB] >3 mmol/L) and ketonuria Signs of ketoacidosis: Kussmaul breathing (deep, heavy, non-labored rapid breathing) Fruity breath odor (acetone) Prolonged Q-T interva Diminished neurocognitive function Coma",

Insulin normally has an inhibitory action on HSL and induces LpL on capillary walls. There is an absolute or relative deficiency of insulin in DM. In DM, the activity of LpL is decreased and HSL is increased. The increased activity of HSL results in increased mobilisation of fat stores towards lipolysis releasing fatty acids. These fatty acids are partly cleared by the liver, resulting in increased synthesis of VLDL and TG, resulting in dyslipidemia. They can accumulate in the liver, resulting in steatosis (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). The reduced activity of LpL prevents the clearing of TG and VLDL in the bloodstream and their levels remain elevated.",

Calcitonin is secreted by the parafollicular C-cells of the thyroid gland. Its principal effects are to lower serum calcium and phosphate by its action on bone and kidney. In bone, calcitonin inhibits osteoclasts and reduces bone resorption. In the kidney, it inhibits the reabsorption of both calcium and phosphate. Other options Option A: In hyperthyroidism, the direct effect of thyroid hormones can lead to bone resorption and mild hypercalcemia. However, hyperparathyroidism is a better answer.

This accompanied with unconjugated hyperbilrubinemia is highly suggestive of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1. No improvement in bilirubin levels following the administration of phenobarbital further supports the diagnosis. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is of two types with type 1 having absent/trace enzyme activity and type 2 having <10% of the normal enzyme activity. Hence, type 1 is far more severe and leads to kernicterus and neurological damage. Type 2 may also lead to kernicterus occasionally. Kernicterus occurs because the unconjugated bilirubin is lipid-soluble and hence crosses the blood-brain barrier. Phenobarbital is an enzyme inducer. Its administration can be used to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 Crigler-Najjar. Enzyme induction by phenobarbital leads to improved conjugation of bilirubin leading to a reduction in total bilirubin level in type 2 Crigler-Najjar syndrome. No improvement is seen in type 1 as the enzyme activity is absent and therefore cannot be induced.

Its diagnosis requires demonstration of hepatic steatosis and exclusion of significant alcohol consumption and other causes of hepatic fat accumulation.",

The tests that should be done in this patient to rule out acute viral hepatitis include: Anti-HAV HBsA IgM anti-HBc Anti-HCV We mainly test for hepatitis A, B, and C. Tests for hepatitis D and E are not used routinely. Hepatitis D only occurs concurrently with Hepatitis B, either as a co-infection (when it is clinically indistinguishable from HBV infection) or superimposed on chronic HBV infection. In the latter scenario, it presents as a sudden worsening of the patient’s condition. IgM anti-HDV, IgG anti-HDV, and HDV RNA assays are useful for diagnosis when hepatitis D is suspected. Hepatitis E is not tested as the majority of patients who acquire hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection spontaneously clear the virus. Acute hepatic failure is more likely in those who are pregnant and in those who are malnourished or have preexisting liver disease. Chronic HEV has been described almost exclusively in immunocompromised hosts (e.g., organ transplantation). The diagnosis of acute HEV is typically based upon the detection of IgM antibodies to HEV. Both false positives and negatives are common with available assays and are thus, not very reliable. Thus, additional serologic testing or HEV RNA testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and not be useful as a screening test.

Menke's disease or Menke-Kinky hair syndrome is an X-linked recessive condition occurring due to a mutation in the ATP7A gene on chromosome X. This causes impaired transport of dietary copper from the small intestine to the liver leading to low levels of copper-containing enzymes. It presents within 3 years of age and is characterized by: Depigmented kinky hair Failure to thrive Neurodegenerative symptoms like loss of developmental milestones, truncal hypotonia, epilepsyLoose, wrinkled skin Multiple fractures Poor visual acuity Recurrent infections. Lab investigations show low serum copper (<65 g/dL) and low ceruloplasmin(<20 mg/dl). The disease is fatal as it has no curative treatment. But, administration of L-histidine and copper chloride injections may be beneficial, if started early. Aceruloplasminemia is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by tissue iron overload, mental deterioration, microcytic anemia, and low serum iron and copper concentrations. Option B: Low serum copper and low ceruloplasmin is also seen in Wilson’s disease, but is associated with the gene defect ATP7B on chromosome 13. It is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism with features of hepatolenticular degeneration and Kayser Fleischer ring. Option A: Dubin Johnson Syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired canalicular excretion of bilirubin due to mutation in MRP-2 protein leading to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Option D: Gilbert’s Syndrome is characterized by decreased UDP glucuronyl transferase activity leading to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which can be autosomal recessive or dominant.

Celiac disease is a disorder characterized by an immunological response to gluten causing damage to the proximal intestinal mucosa (villous atrophy) and malabsorption of nutrients. Symptoms usually begin 6 to 24 months from the introduction of gluten into diet, although most patients go undiagnosed. The common manifestations are - irritability, abdominal distention, chronic diarrhea, weight loss or muscle wasting and extra-intestinally, the symptoms observed are aphthous ulcers, delayed puberty, iron deficiency anemia and short stature. Screening for celiac disease is by testing for tissue transglutaminase IgA, endomysial, and deamidated antigliadin antibodies. IgA levels in serum are measured to detect false-negative results because of IgA deficiency. Small intestinal biopsy shows characteristic villus blunting, crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. The treatment involves the exclusion of gluten-containing food from diet. Long term complications observed are osteoporosis, anemia, infertility and malignancy (enteropathy related-T cell lymphoma is the most common association) The Marsh classification is used to categorize celiac disease into different types and to quantify severity of disease involvement.",

Negative staining for CD5 and CD10 is seen, suggesting it arises from the marginal zone of lymphoid tissues. Chronic infection with H. pylori leads to the development of MALTomas. When these lesions are limited to the mucosa, treatment of the infection alone is sufficient to cause regression of the tumour. In high-grade tumors or the tumors which invade into the adjacent or distant organs, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are required to treat the tumor. Radiotherapy is usually three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy.

It is common in older women, and they usually have a history of smoking, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral artery disease. The important clinical features of chronic mesenteric ischemia are: Postprandial abdominal pain occurs as a result of a mismatch between the increased deman and decreased blood flow to the intestine. This is called intestinal angina Weight loss- patients avoid eating due to postprandial pain and this leads to significant weight loss Diarrhea- occurs as a result of decreased absorption Physical examination may reveal epigastric bruit in almost half of the patients. The gold standard investigation to diagnose the blockade is mesenteric angiography. Once the disease is confirmed, the patients have to be started with antiplatelets and mesenteric angioplasty and stenting should be performed. Option A: Acute mesenteric ischemia present with acute abdomen, bloody diarrhea and nausea. Angiography will show occlusion of superior mesenteric artery. Option C: Wilkie's syndrome occurs due to compression of the third portion of the duodenum by the superior mesenteric artery. It can present similarly, however is associated with vomiting and rapid weight loss. It usually occurs in young, asthenic women.

        "explanation": "One-third of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) cases are associated with Hepatitis B. Other options: Option A: Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis which is associated with necrotizing inflammation of small and medium-sized muscular arteries. Option B: Patients show hypergammaglobulinemia. Option C: PAN is rarely associated with ANCA positivity. There is no serological test for PAN. Most patients exhibit an elevated leukocyte count with a predominance of neutrophils. PAN is usually seen in young adults, characterized by rapidly accelerating hypertension, abdominal pain, bloody stools, myalgias, and peripheral neuropathy. Arterial inflammation is segmental, necrotizing, and transmural, leading to aneurysms and thrombosis. The involved vessels are typically found at arterial bifurcations, spreading to veins but sparing venules. The most commonly affected organs are the kidney, heart, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, in that order. Pulmonary arteries are not involved. Inadequate blood flow leads to ischemia, ulcers, infarcts, atrophy, or hemorrhage. Diagnosis relies on histopathological findings from organ biopsies or the demonstration of aneurysms in small to medium-sized arteries of the renal, hepatic, and visceral vasculature. Untreated PAN has an extremely poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of only 10 to 20%. Common causes of death include gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel infarcts and perforation, as well as cardiovascular issues. Timely treatment is vital for improved outcomes. Combining prednisone and cyclophosphamide has shown significant benefits in survival rates. Glucocorticoids alone may be sufficient for milder cases. In PAN cases associated with hepatitis B or C, antiviral therapy is combined with glucocorticoids and plasma exchange. Managing hypertension effectively can help reduce vascular complications. Despite successful treatment, relapses occur in approximately 10-20% of patients. A histopathological image of PAN showing necrotizing transmural inflammation is given below: The image below shows aneurysms in renal vasculature:",

The addition of leflunomide or a biological (anti - TNF) to methotrexate is another alternative. Ideally, the approach to a patient with early RA is aggressive. Methotrexate is always the first DMARD that the patient is started on, and if an adequate response is not observed within 3-6 months, a step up in therapy is made by adding on drugs. For assessment of progression, composite indices like Disease Activity Score - 28 (DAS-28) can used. Other options: Option A: Changing the route of administration of methotrexate from oral to parenteral is not a part of step up Option C: Priority is given to minimising the duration the patient is on steroids. Option D: Anti -TNF agents (adalimumab, etanercept) are not recommended as a monotherapy, and are reserved for treatment in combination with DMARDs. This is due to the fact that the efficacy of monotherapy is lesser than that of DMARDs, and the adverse effects include increased risk of serious infections, re-activation of latent TB and opportunistic fungal infections.

        "explanation": "Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure provided there are no absolute contraindications. This approach improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases hospitalization duration and enhances overall survival outcomes. Invasive positive pressure ventilation is only considered after failure of NIPPV, resulting in severe respiratory distress, life threatening hypoxemia, severe hypercarbia and/or acidosis, markedly impaired mental status, respiratory arrest or hemodynamic instability (Option B). Apart from NIPPV, short-acting inhaled beta 2 agonists (albuterol, salbutamol) with or without short-acting anticholinergics (ipratropium) and Long-acting anticholinergics (tiotropium) are recommended as the initial bronchodilators. Maintenance therapy with long-acting beta 2 agonists (formoterol) must be started as soon as possible. Systemic corticosteroids are useful in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD as they reduce airway inflammation and improve lung function over time. However, the effects are not immediate. NIPPV on the other hand provides immediate relief to the patient and reduces the work of breathing. Therefore, it would not be the best choice in this case. (Option C) Antibiotics can also be considered, as they reduce duration of hospitalisation. Treatment is given for 5 days. Permissive hypercapnia refers to a ventilation strategy where tidal volume is reduced in order to avoid hyperinflation-associated lung trauma. It is not preferred at the initial presentation. It is only permitted once invasive PPV is started following NIPPV failure (Option D) An exacerbation of COPD is defined as an event characterized by dyspnea and/or cough and sputum that worsen over < 14 days. Exacerbations of COPD are often associated with increased local and systemic inflammation caused by airway infection, pollution, or other insults to the lungs.",

        "explanation": "The most likely causative agent of pneumonia in an infant with X-ray showing pneumatoceles (air-filled cysts within lung parenchyma) is Staphylococcus aureus. In newborns and infants, S. aureus is a significant cause of severe respiratory tract infections, presenting with dyspnea, fever, and respiratory failure. Community-acquired infections are often preceded by viral infections, most commonly influenza. Among adults, nosocomial S. aureus pulmonary infections are frequently observed in intubated patients within intensive care units. S. aureus often causes necrotizing pneumonitis that may be associated with complications such as pneumothorax and empyema. Pneumatocoele can also be caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, E. coli, group A streptococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, etc. However, Staphylococcus aureus is most commonly implicated. Other options: Option A: Klebsiella pneumoniae causes lobar pneumonia in alcoholics and diabetics. Patients present with fever, dyspnea, and a productive cough with red currant jelly sputum. Classic chest X-ray findings include upper lobe consolidation, classically on the right side, cavitation, and bulging fissure sign. The following image shows bulging fissure sign: Option B: Streptococcus pneumoniae causes lobar pneumonia. Patients with pneumococcal pneumonia present with fever, dyspnea, and productive cough. On examination, the involved lobes are dull to percussion, bronchial breath sounds, and crackles are heard on auscultation. The following image shows right lower lobe consolidation: Option C: Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes atypical pneumonia. Patients present with dry cough, fever, chills, malaise, and upper respiratory tract symptoms. On auscultation, wheezes or rales are heard. Chest X-ray shows peribronchial pneumonia with prominent bronchial markings, interstitial infiltration, and atelectasis. The below chest X-ray shows patchy consolidation at the hilum and fanning to the periphery:",

A characteristic feature of PCP is retrosternal chest pain, which worsens on inspiration and is described as sharp or burning. It is important to note that even though the incidence of PCP is the highest at CD4+ counts of <200/L (80%), it can be seen in patients with higher counts. Other options: Option D: Tuberculosis (TB) should be considered as a possibility in cases of pneumonia in people living with HIV. However, the absence of hilar lymph node involvement, non-productive cough, and no extrapulmonary (pleural, pericardial, lymphatic) features are not consistent with tuberculosis. TB can occur at any stage of HIV infection. In the early stages, pulmonary TB appears typically with upper-lobe infiltrates and cavitation. In advanced HIV infection, with CD4+ T-cell count below 200/L, TB presents with diffuse interstitial infiltrates, minimal cavitation, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy. Extrapulmonary TB is fairly common in HIV, with it being documented in 40-60% of cases. Option A: Staphylococcal pneumonia most commonly presents with a productive cough, and radiologically presents with pneumatoceles (cavitations) Option B: Patients with pneumococcal pneumonia also present with fever, dyspnea, and productive cough.

It occurs almost exclusively in patients with asthma (~2.5% of patients) or cystic fibrosis (up to 15%). In chronic cases, repeated episodes of bronchial obstruction, inflammation, and mucoid impaction can lead to bronchiectasis, fibrosis, and respiratory compromise. While central bronchiectasis is characteristic, some patients can develop chronic cavitary lesions. With the development of ABPA, asthma or cystic fibrosis typically worsens and may manifest with a new or worsening cough or an increase in sputum production or wheezing. Many patients report coughing up thick sputum casts. The presence of hyperattenuating mucus in the airways is highly specific. ABPA is diagnosed serologically, based on the presence of: Serum IgE > 1000 IU/ml Positive skin prick test or IgE levels against A. fumigatus extract Detection of Aspergillus-specific antibodies Eosinophilia >500 cells/L Treatment - The use of systemic glucocorticoids is indicated for ABPA, but the course should be tapered by 3-6 months.

        "explanation": "Hypocalcemia, not hypercalcemia, is seen in tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the rapid destruction of a large number of tumor cells. The release of calcium phosphate from lysed cells contributes to hyperphosphatemia and subsequent reciprocal depression in serum calcium levels. The consumption of ionized calcium during the formation of calcium phosphate crystals leads to hypocalcemia. TLS is commonly observed after initiation of chemotherapy in hematologic malignancies characterized by high cell turnover rates, such as Burkitt's lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The destruction of neoplastic cells results in the release of nucleic acids, which are broken down into uric acid, leading to hyperuricemia. The acidic environment in the renal tubules can cause uric acid to precipitate, leading to acute renal failure. Potassium is released in large quantities during tumor cell lysis leading to hyperkalemia. TLS is diagnosed using the Cairo-Bishop criteria which includes both laboratory and clinical criteria. Prevention is the mainstay of the management of TLS, which involves includes allopurinol, which inhibits the production of uric acid, and aggressive hydration to promote urine flow. Urinary alkalization is not recommended. Febuxostat, a selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor, can be used as an alternative. In severe cases or when renal failure is present, rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, is used for treatment. Rasburicase rapidly lowers uric acid levels by converting it into a highly soluble compound called allantoin. Renal replacement therapy is often required and should be considered in case of acute renal failure. Renal Replacement Therapy",

The following types of vascular access may be used for hemodialysis: AV fistulas: Fistula refers to the anastomosis of an artery and an adequately large vein (either side-to-side or end-to-side). This causes arterialization of the vein, thereby causing venous wall thickening and increasing venous diameter. Fistulas need 4-6 weeks to mature before they can be used. The access of choice is radiocephalic AV fistula (Brescia-Cimino fistula). Fistulas have higher long-term patency rates than grafts. Thrombosis is a common complication. The following image depicts a radiocephalic fistula. AV grafts: The artery and vein are connected by a prosthetic graft such as PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene). The advantage is that it can be performed with smaller veins. Complications include stenosis (most common), due to intimal hyperplasia at anastomosis between graft and vein, and infections. Central venous catheter: Tunneled catheters are used for long-term IV access. As they tunnel through the skin before entering the vein, they have a lower risk of infection.",

It is not associated with elevated uric acid levels and gout. MCKD2 is due to a defect in the UMOD gene, which codes for the protein uromodulin. It is associated with hyperuricemia and gout.",

Option B: In mitral regurgitation (MR), due to the regurgitation of blood from the LV to the LA, the LV ejection time decreases leading to early aortic valve closure. Option C: In pulmonary stenosis (PS), the delayed closure of pulmonary valves leads to the splitting of S2. Wide splitting of S2 is also heard in RBBB and LV pacing.",

Types of ventricular tachycardia based on QRS morphology: Monomorphic- a stable QRS morphology from beat to beat Polymorphic- changing or multiform QRS variance from beat to beat. Torsades de pointes is an example of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Bidirectional- has a beat-to-beat alternation in the QRS frontal plane axis. It is associated with digitalis toxicity or catecholaminergic polymorphic VT. The most common cause of VT is ischemic heart disease. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias occur due to impulses that originate within the ventricles. These impulses are conducted through the normal ventricular myocardial cells instead of the fast conducting Purkinje system. Hence, they present with wide QRS complexes ( >0.12 sec) on the ECG. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias occur due to impulses originating above the ventricles. These impulses reach the ventricles through the proper fast conduction pathway resulting in a narrow QRS complex. SVTs are associated with wide QRS in few exceptional conditions like: Conduction block in the left or right bundle branch Activation of ventricles from an accessory pathway- antidromic AVRT The given ECG shows wide stable QRS complexes in monomorphic ventricular tachycardia:",

        "explanation": "Sick sinus syndrome is frequently seen in patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation. Sick sinus syndrome (or sinus node dysfunction) is a group of abnormal heart rhythms. It is a disorder of the sinoatrial node caused by impaired pacemaker function and impulse transmission. This leads to a combination of abnormal rhythms, including atrial bradyarrhythmias, atrial tachyarrhythmias, and sometimes a pattern of alternating bradycardia and tachycardia, known as tachy-brady syndrome. These irregular rhythms can cause symptoms such as palpitations, decreased tissue perfusion, subsequent fatigue, lightheadedness, pre-syncope, and syncope. The management of sick sinus syndrome includes identifying and correcting reversible factors, as an initial step. Some examples of reversible causes of Sinus Node Dysfunction include, Hypothyroidism Sleep apnea Anti-hypertensive medications eg. Beta-blockers Anti-arrhythmic medications eg. Amiodarone, Procainamide Ambulatory ECG monitoring is required to diagnose as the symptoms are nonspecific. Treatment involves permanent pacing. Other options: Option A: The course of sinus node dysfunction is usually a slow progression over decades. In the early stages, most patients are asymptomatic. Option B: It occurs most commonly in elderly patients due to the gradual loss of SA node function. Option D: Beta-blockers are contraindicated in this condition.

They show wide QRS complexes (>0.12 ms) on the ECG because they are conducted via normal myocardial tissue instead of the Purkinje system. Ventricular bigeminy refers to a pair of normal and premature ventricular contractions, whereas ventricular trigeminy refers to a premature beat that occurs after two normal beats. Quadrigeminy is when a premature beat follows three normal beats.

The ECG shows wide QRS complex (> 0.12 s) tachycardia with a single QRS morphology suggestive of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). The most appropriate treatment of VT in a hemodynamically unstable (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg) patient is DC cardioversion. VT can be casued by structural heart disease, scar-related reentry, cardiomyopathies, or abnormalities in the conduction pathways. VT is said to be sustained if it lasts for at least 30 seconds or requires intervention for termination. Rapid VT can lead to hypotension and syncope, especially in patients with ventricular dysfunction. Patients with normal cardiac function may tolerate sustained VT, presenting with palpitations. Monomorphic VT associated with structural heart disease can progress to ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden cardiac arrest. QRS synchronous electrical cardioversion is performed for unstable patients. Intravenous amiodarone is the preferred drug for stable VT associated with heart disease. After restoring sinus rhythm, further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying heart disease. Treatment options include antiarrhythmic medications, catheter ablation, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for recurrent or high-risk VT.

There is a progressive lengthening of the PR interval and QRS duration with an increase in potassium levels, eventually leading to the disappearance of the P wave; and widening of the QRS complex to a sine wave pattern. Option C: Hypocalcemia causes prolongation of the QT interval. There is a lengthening of the ST segment, while the T wave (which correlates with the time for repolarization) remains unaltered.

When the MVA is <~2 sq cm, blood flows from the left atrium to the left ventricle, propelled by a mildly elevated atrial pressure. Hence, patients are usually asymptomatic and may develop dyspnea only when the heart rate increases, as seen in exertion, excitement, fever, etc. All these conditions: Increase the rate of blood flow across the mitral orifice, resulting in further elevation of the LA pressure Decrease the diastolic filling time, resulting in a reduction in cardiac output The image below explains the mechanism of mitral stenosis.",

Three cardinal clinical features of aortic stenosis are: Exertional dyspnea - this occurs due to the left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Raised end-diastolic LV volume and reduced LV compliance lead to increased LV pressure, leading t elevation of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Angina pectoris - it occurs due to the combination of the increased O2 needs of hypertrophied myocardium and reduction of O2 delivery. Syncope - it occurs due to the combination of decreased cardiac output and systemic arterial dilation which lead to a reduction of cerebral perfusion.",

Auscultation findings in aortic stenosis: Early systolic ejection sound - heard in early stages, disappears when the valve becomes calcified and rigid Paradoxical splitting of S2 - With worsening of stenosis, delayed closure of the aortic valve ccurs. This leads to narrowing of S2 sound, and in severe cases, leads to paradoxical splitting of S2.

Troponins will remain elevated longer than creatine kinase (CK), for up to 14 days. This makes troponins a superior marker for diagnosing MI in the recent past (late diagnosis). Reinfarction: It is now clear that cardiac troponin (cTn) increases rapidly, even if it is from an abnormal baseline in patients with reinfarction. Sometimes cTn concentration is elevated, but stable or decreasing at the time of suspected reinfarction. In this case, the diagnosis of reinfarction requires a 20% or greater increase in the cTn measurement Creatine kinase (CK): Less sensitive and specific than troponins When cTn is available, CK-MB should not be used for the initial diagnosis of acute MI Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): Normally, LDH2>LDH1; but, in MI, LDH1>LDH2. This is called flipping of the LDH ratio. Current recommendations suggest that LDH no longer has a role in the diagnosis of MI. Myoglobin: Earliest enzyme to increase after MI. Not specific to cardiac muscle and can be elevated to any form of injury to skeletal muscle. Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), which mainly exists in cardiomyocytes, has recently emerged as a potential biomarker, which was found to be sensitive for the early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.

Coronary angiography demonstrates transient coronary spasm which is the diagnostic hallmark of PVA.

        "explanation": "The given clinical scenario of sudden heart failure in a previously healthy person under a stressful situation is suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is also called broken heart syndrome, apical ballooning syndrome, or stress-induced cardiomyopathy. It is a transient myocardial stunning from microcirculation spams due to a catecholamine surge during stress. It is usually seen in middle-aged women. The patients can present with pulmonary edema, hypotension, and chest pain. ECHO reveals apical dilatation with basal hypercontraction of the heart, resembling a Takotsubo (pot for catching octopus). The ECG changes can mimic myocardial infarction but changes extend beyond a particular coronary arterial territory. Coronary angiography, therefore, may be needed to rule out coronary occlusion. (Option B) It is a self-limiting disorder resolving within days to weeks. The prognosis is generally good. The image below shows left ventriculography during systole showing apical ballooning resembling a Takotsubo pot. Other options: Option A: Infective cardiomyopathy: The most common causes of infective myocarditis are viral infections and the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which is associated with Chagas' disease. Acute viral myocarditis often presents with symptoms and signs of heart failure, although it can also manifest as chest pain and show electrocardiogram (ECG) changes resembling pericarditis or acute myocardial infarction. In Chagas' disease, specific features include abnormalities in the conduction system, particularly dysfunction of the sinus node and AV node, as well as the right bundle branch block. Option C: Dilated cardiomyopathy: It is the most common cardiomyopathy and is predominantly characterised by systolic dysfunction. Though it may present acutely, it progresses chronically. The familial form is due to mutations in TTN gene which encode the sarcomeric protein titin. Other etiologocal agents include alcohol, infective myocarditis, doxorubicin, hemochromatosis and sarcoidosis. Option D: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic cardiovascular disorder and is a prominent cause of sudden death before the age of 35 years. Family history is commonly present, a sarcomere mutation is present in ~50% of patients. Sudden death can be due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. Risk factors for sudden death in this disease include young age, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, failure of blood pressure to increase during exercise, recent (within 6 months) syncope, ventricular wall thickness >3 cm, and possibly the severity of LV outflow obstruction.",

Myocardial stunning is a state where certain segments of the myocardium (usually corresponding to an area of major coronary occlusion) show forms of contractile abnormality (dysfunction) on echocardiography. In Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, while the ECG changes mimic a myocardial infarction(MI), the left ventricular dysfunction extends well beyond the distribution of a specific coronary artery. Thus, the myocardial stunning pattern might not fully match the ECG. Ventriculography shows apica dilation with basal contraction. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurs typically in older women and is associated with a sudden increase in emotional or physical stress, presenting with hypotension, chest pain with ECG changes of acute MI, and pulmonary edema. Its also known as apical ballooning syndrome or acute stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Option B: Restrictive cardiomyopathy is characterized by diastolic dysfunction with reduced contractility and ejection fraction, most commonly seen in amyloidosis, and enlarged ventricles on imaging with low-voltage ECG complexes. Option C: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a type of familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), having defects in desmosomal proteins, affecting the ventricles showing thin ventricular walls on Echo, epsilon waves, and low voltage ECG complexes. Option D: Pericardial tamponade is characterized by hypotension, muffled heart sounds and increased jugular venous pressure with muffled heart sounds with total electrical alternans and sinus tachycardia in ECG.",

Sacubitril (neprilysin inhibitor) is approved in combination with valsartan (ARB), in a ratio of 1:1. The combination is approved for use in chronic heart failure. Sacubitril is a prodrug that is activated to sacubitrilat. It inhibits the enzyme neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase), which is responsible for the degradation of atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (reduction of blood volume). Thus, it increases the levels of atrial and brain natriuretic peptides and lowers blood pressure.",

Options B and C: Spironolactone (K+ sparing diuretic) and enalapril (ACE inhibitor) can cause hyperkalemia. The first step in managing acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is addressing the factors that caused the decompensation. They include nonadherence to medications, dietary indiscretion, medication use that exacerbates heart failure, coronary ischemia, arrhythmias, valvular heart disease, infection, and pulmonary thromboembolism. Volume management is crucial in ADHF. Intravenous loop diuretics are used to relieve congestion. The effectiveness of diuretic therapy can be assessed by changes in weight, improvement in symptoms, and clinical examination findings. Natriuretic peptide levels can also help assess the adequacy of therapy and predict risk. Cardiorenal syndrome, characterized by the interplay between heart and kidney dysfunction, is a common complication of ADHF. Diuretic therapy should be carefully managed to avoid worsening renal function in patients with elevated right-sided filling pressures. In cases of severe low cardiac output, inotropic therapy or mechanical circulatory support may be necessary to preserve or improve renal function temporarily. Vasodilators like nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside, and nesiritide (recombinant BNP) are used to reduce filling pressures and systemic vascular resistance. Inotropic therapy with drugs like dopamine and milrinone is used to increase myocardial contractility and improve cardiac output in patients with low-output ADHF. Dopamine has dose-dependent effects on different receptors, while milrinone is a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor.",

        "explanation": "The patient with cardiac tamponade is asked to breathe normally to elicit pulsus paradoxus. In a patient with cardiac tamponade, both ventricles share an incompressible pericardial covering due to the fluid. As the right ventricle enlarges during inspiration, the interventricular septum bulges into the left ventricle, reducing the left ventricular volume. This results in reduced stroke volume and hence reduced systolic arterial pressure. As a result, there is a greater than normal (more than 10 mmHg) fall in systolic arterial blood pressure during inspiration, producing pulsus paradoxus. This cannot be elicited if the patient is holding his/her breath, taking long or shallow breaths. Pulsus paradoxus is also seen with effusive constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy and right ventricular myocardial infarction.",

In conditions where the myocardium or pericardium is poorly compliant, it does not allow the right heart chambers to accommodate more blood and this fall is not seen. In fact, due to an increase in venous return during inspiration, the JVP might rise. This is called Kussmaul's sign. This is seen in: Restrictive cardiomyopathy Constrictive pericarditis Massive pulmonary embolism Right ventricular infarcts Advanced cases of left ventricular systolic failure Kussmaul’s sign is not seen in patients with cardiac tamponade because even though the increase in pericardial pressure exerts an inward force compressing the entire heart during inspiration, the increase in negative intrathoracic pressure is still transmitted to the right side of the heart. This allows for an increase in blood flow to the right atrium. Therefore, the JVP falls as seen in normal conditions.

The immediate next step, in this case, would be needle decompression at the fifth intercostal space anterior to the mid-axillary line (as the patient is an adult). In children, the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line is chosen as the site for needle decompression. Needle decompression turns a tension pneumothorax into an open pneumothorax. It has to be followed by tube thoracostomy. An intercostal chest drain (ICD) tube is inserted in the triangle of safety, just anterior to the midaxillary line on the side of the lung injury. The site of insertion is the same in both children and adults. The triangle of safety is bounded by the lateral border of the pectoralis major anteriorly, the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi posteriorly, and the fifth intercostal space inferiorly, with the apex below the axilla. This provides a safe landmark for the insertion of an ICD with minimal risk of tissue injury. Tension pneumothorax is a condition where air accumulates in the pleural space due to a one-way valve air leak, leading to the collapse of the affected lung. This can cause a mediastinal shift, compression of the opposite lung, and decreased venous return, resulting in obstructive shock. It commonly occurs during positive-pressure mechanical ventilation, but can also happen after chest trauma, subclavian/internal jugular venous catheter insertion, or chest wall defects. The diagnosis is clinical, and immediate treatment is necessary without waiting for radiological confirmation. Tension pneumothorax is characterized by chest pain, tachypnoea, tachycardia, hypotension, tracheal deviation away from the side of injury, absent breath sounds on the affected side, cyanosis, and neck vein distention. Patients can also develop subcutaneous emphysema as a complication secondary to the pneumothorax. Pulmonary Hypertension",

Warfarin & parenteral anticoagulation need to be overlapped for at least 5 days, independent of the INR achieved during these 5 days in patients with acute venous thromboembolism. Warfarin inhibits protein C, protein S (which is part of the fibrinolytic pathway) in addition to factors II, VII, IX, X. Protein C has a short half-life (4-6 hours) and thus decreases early. Since protein C is antithrombotic, decreased levels of protein C by warfarin renders the patient hypercoagulable during the first few days of treatment before factor II with a long half-life (36 hours) decreases and protects the patient from thrombosis. Thus warfarin creates a prothrombotic state in the first 5 days putting the patient at risk of progression of thrombosis unless a parenteral anticoagulant is given overlapping warfarin for these days.",

        "explanation": "This patient is most probably suffering from antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) as her lupus anticoagulant is strongly positive. In such patients, the initial anticoagulation is with unfractionated heparin and is monitored by anti-Xa tests. Due to the presence of lupus anticoagulant, the lab measurement of aPTT will show erroneously prolonged aPTT. Therefore, even though there is an apparently prolonged aPTT, the patient is at increased risk of thrombosis and not bleeding, and hence patients with APS should be anticoagulated. Anti Xa tests are not influenced by APS. So, the patient can be monitored for the adequacy of anticoagulation with UFH by monitoring anti-Xa. Option A: The patient’s aPTT is already prolonged due to lupus anticoagulant, so we cannot monitor the patient with aPTT after starting unfractionated heparin. Option C: Warfarin in the first few days of therapy, causes a decrease in Protein C & S levels, causing a prothrombotic state. Hence, a heparin bridge is necessary for APS which is already a pro-thrombotic state. Option D: Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor used in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia(HIT) to prevent thrombosis and also to increase platelet levels. Therapy is monitored with aPTT. Note: Lupus anticoagulant may function as an inhibitor in vitro by binding to the reagent phospholipid and blocking the phospholipid-dependent reactions of the intrinsic pathway. The net effect is a prolongation of the aPTT.",

Aspirin + clopidogrel(Option B) is used in secondary prevention of stroke and also to prevent stroke following TIA. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) refer to episodes of stroke symptoms that have a brief duration, the standard definition of duration is <24 h, but most TIAs last <1 hr. TIAs may arise from emboli to the brain or from in situ thrombosis of an intracranial vessel. With a TIA, the occluded blood vessel reopens and neurologic function is restored. If a relevant brain infarction is identified on brain imaging, the clinical entity is now classified as stroke regardless of the duration of symptoms. The risk of stroke following a transient ischemic attack (TIA) is approximately 10-15% in the first three months, majorly in the first two days. A reliable estimation of this risk can be obtained using the ABCD2 score.

Dysphagia(Option A) poses a high risk of aspiration and hence can't be left untreated. Spasticity(Option B) can be treated with baclofen, tizanidine. Untreated, it creates a psychosocial impact on the patient. Fever(Option C) is deleterious in stroke patients and must be treated. Neglect can arise from injury to cortical-limbic-reticular network, that directs attention and integrates the localization and identification of a stimulus. Neglect is associated with poor scores and slower recovery, but severe neglect is rare beyond 6 months. Recovery is rapid in the first 2 weeks, regardless of the side of stroke. By 3 months, patients might have some residual visual neglect. The choice of an intervention depends on the mechanism of neglect, the patient can be treated for an underaroused right hemisphere which has difficulty processing sensory inputs. Neurogenic dysphagia is an important cause of pulmonary infection in any patient with stroke, motor neuron disease, even transient dysphagia can lead to malnutrition, dehydration, aspiration pneumonia, and airway obstruction with asphyxia, it increases the risk of death and institutionalization. Early placement of nasogastric tube to feed patients after stroke has improved nutrition and reduced deaths. Spasticity is seen in less than 20% of stroke patients. Patients with bilateral weakness from hypoxic injury are likely to have signs of spasticity. Exaggerated cutaneous and autonomic reflexes and involuntary spasms are disabling problems associated with spasticity. Physical modalities like slow stretching movements and daily passive exercises will reduce symptoms of spasticity and risk of contractures. Baclofen, tizanidine, and clonidine are used in reducing clonus and extensor spasms.",

Most commonly, it occurs around the circle of Willis due to the rupture of a berry aneurysm at this location. SAH can present with fever, positive Kernig’s sign, and Brudzinski’s sign, as well as mimic meningitis or encephalitis. Treatment with the calcium channel antagonist nimodipine (60 mg PO every 4 h) improves outcome, by preventing ischemic injury. Option A: Vancomycin + ceftriaxone is the recommended therapy for bacterial meningitis. Meningitis does not show hyper-attenuated subarachnoid space. Option B: IV Tenecteplase is used for ischemic stroke without bleeding complications. Peripheral Neuropathy",

These decussating fibers carry crude touch, pain, and temperature sensations. Spinal trauma, syringomyelia, and intrinsic cord tumors are the main causes. Option A: In Brown–Sequard Syndrome, ipsilateral weakness and loss of joint position and vibratory sense, with contralateral loss of pain and temperature sense, one or two levels below the lesion is seen. Option C: Anterior spinal artery syndrome is caused due to an ASA infarct. It typically presents as loss of motor function and pain/temperature sensation, with relative sparing of proprioception and vibratory sense below the level of the lesion. Option D: In foramen magnum syndrome, compressive lesions near the foramen magnum may produce weakness of the ipsilateral shoulder and arm followed by weakness of the ipsilateral leg, then the contralateral leg, and finally the contralateral arm. This is referred to as 'around the clock' pattern.",

The sensory deficit has a distribution that is 'suspended' over the nape of the neck, shoulders, and upper arms (cape distribution) or in the hands. Areflexic weakness is seen in the upper limbs. Extension of the syrinx into the grey matter of the cord causes muscle wasting in the lower neck, shoulders, arms, and hands with asymmetric or absent reflexes in the arms. Extension of the syrinx into the medulla (syringobulbia) causes palatal or vocal cord paralysis, dysarthria, horizontal or vertical nystagmus, episodic dizziness or vertigo, and tongue weakness with atrophy.",

        "explanation": "Absent deep tendon reflex is not a feature of myasthenia gravis (MG). MG usually occurs in young females. Patients usually present with weakness and fatiguability of the muscles, which worsens on repeated use or late in the day and improves on rest. The cranial muscles, particularly the eyelids and extraocular muscles are involved early in the course of MG. Diplopia and ptosis are common initial complaints. When MG becomes generalized, the proximal muscles of the limbs are affected first. Despite the muscle weakness, the deep tendon reflexes remain normal. Snarling expression on smiling (facial weakness), nasal timbre of speech (weakness of palate and tongue), and difficulty swallowing may be seen. Bulbar weakness and respiratory depression are seen more frequently in MuSK antibody–positive MG. MG is an autoimmune disorder most commonly caused by antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). These antibodies cause damage to the postsynaptic muscle membrane and increased endocytosis of the AChR. This autoimmune response against the AChR seems to be mediated by the thymus. The myoid (muscle-like) cells present in the thymus express AChRs on their surface and are postulated to provide the autoantigen which triggers this autoimmune reaction. Thymic hyperplasia is seen in 65% of the patients, and thymomas are seen in 10% of the patients. The tests which are used to confirm the diagnosis of MG include: Anti-AChR antibody immunoassay: 85% of myasthenic patients have detectable anti-AChR antibodies, but only 50% of patients with weakness limited to ocular muscles. The presence of anti-AChR antibodies is highly suggestive of MG, but a negative test does not exclude the disease. Antibodies to MuSK and LRP4 are found in some patients Recurrent nerve stimulation test: MG shows a decremental response > 10%, while Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) shows an incremental response Block and jitter response on single-fiber electromyography Positive edrophonium test: improvement of ptosis on the administration of anticholinesterase such as edrophonium Positive ice-pack test: improvement of ptosis on the application of ice-pack on the affected eye The first line of medical management in MG is anticholinesterase drugs. Pyridostigmine 30–60 mg three to four times daily is the most commonly used drug. Patients are evaluated for associated thymic abnormalities using a CT chest. Thymectomy is considered in patients with thymoma and in generalized MG patients with anti-AChR antibodies. Immunotherapy therapy can be initiated in patients with poor control on pyridostigmine after thymectomy. Glucocorticoids, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus are generally effective within 1-3 months. Azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil may take several months to show beneficial effects and are used for the long-term management of MG. Rituximab has shown effectiveness in patients with MuSK antibodies. Intravenous eculizumab, which binds to terminal complement component 5, is also effective. Myasthenic crisis is the life-threatening exacerbation of MG leading to respiratory failure. Treatment for myasthenic crisis should take place in intensive care units. It is important to rule out excessive anticholinesterase medication as a cause of deterioration by temporarily discontinuing these drugs. Plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) are beneficial in hastening recovery.",

Ptosis in myasthenia gravis is insidious, bilateral, and frequently asymmetrical. Investigations of myasthenia gravis include: Ice pack test -This tests for a transient improvement of the ptotic eyelid on placing an ice pack for 2 minutes, as the cold inhibits the breakdown of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase. Tensilon (Edrophonium) test - This tests for a transient improvement in the weakness on administration of a short-acting anticholinesterase such as edrophonium.

If the AChR-Abs test negative, an assay for antibodies against muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) should be performed. Single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) simultaneously records action potentials of two muscle fibers innervated by the same motor axon. The variability in time of the second action potential relative to the first is called \"jitter\" and this is increased in myasthenia gravis. Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) is considered abnormal if there is a decremental response of >10%. The edrophonium (\"Tensilon\") test should be used for diagnosis only in those patients with obvious ptosis or ophthalmoparesis and is not confirmatory. This test is not used routinely. Electrophysiological (RNS/SFEMG) tests are used to diagnose patients affected with seronegative myasthenia gravis.",

Under normal circumstances, nerve conduction in myelinated axons occurs in a saltatory manner i.e from one node of Ranvier to another. But, when demyelination sets in, the nerve impulse are unable to travel as fast due to not being saltatory. This produces either a conduction block or delay. Lesions due to multiple sclerosis begin with perivenular cuffing by inflammatory mononuclear cells. Myelin-specific autoantibodies cause degeneration of myelin sheaths. As lesions evolve, prominent astrocytic proliferation (gliosis) is observed. Demyelination is the hallmark in the pathology of multiple sclerosis. But, it is not solely a disease affecting the myelin sheath. Partial or total axonal destruction (neuronal loss) can also occur.",

        "explanation": "Tigroid white matter on MR imaging is seen in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. It is a rare, X-linked recessive disorder characterized by central nervous system dysmyelination. The proteolipid protein gene (PLP1) is affected, leading to the failure of axon myelination by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Clinical Features: Nystagmus Developmental delay Psychomotor delay Seizure Stridor Feeding difficulties Ataxia Hypotonia progressing to spasticity. The degree of dysmyelination is correlated with the severity of the clinical manifestations. Genetic analysis can confirm the diagnosis. MRI shows a lack of myelination and MR spectroscopy reveals aberrant N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and choline concentrations that reflect axonal and myelination abnormalities. Unlike other demyelinating leukodystrophies such as metachromatic leukodystrophy and adrenoleukodystrophy, where myelin is formed but subsequently destroyed, PMD shows a failure of myelin formation.

Familial forms of parkinsonism (designated PARK1 through PARK13) have been associated with causative mutations in a number of nuclear genes. A few of these are: The LRRK2 gene mutation causes autosomal dominant PD (PARK8). In this condition, Middle to late-onset PD is seen, which resembles typical PD and is responsive to levodopa. Mutations in alpha-synuclein (PARK 1 and PARK4) cause rare forms of familial PD and constitute the major component of Lewy bodies in sporadic PD. Parkin-associated PD (PARK 2) & PINK1-associated PD (PARK6) are autosomal recessive seen in young-onset PD. Mutation in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) gene of Gauchers represents the most important risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease. Patients with PD who are GBA mutation carriers have a younger age at onset.",

There is an irresistible urge to shake the legs associated with burning sensation, itching, and cramps of the legs. In idiopathic cases, dopaminergic hypofunction is postulated. In patients with restless legs syndrome, iron stores are initially repleted, and the aggravating factors are eliminated. If RLS still persists, initial therapy with a gabapentinoid (pregabalin, gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil) is preferred, rather than a dopamine agonist (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine). This is due to the high frequency of intermediate and long-term augmentation with dopamine agonists, as well as their risk of impulse control disorders. FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of restless leg syndrome: Gabapentin Ropinirole Pramipexole Rotigotine A dopamine agonist is used as an alternative in patients with increased risk for side effects from gabapentinoids, such as those with obesity and its complications, a past or present history of moderate to severe depression, a disorder causing gait instability or respiratory failure, and a history of substance use disorder. Non-pharmacological treatments that can be used in restless leg syndrome are: Avoiding alcohol at bedtime Massaging affected legs Hot baths Applying hot or cold to the affected area Engaging in moderate exercises ALS and Other Motor Neuron Diseases",

CRC = Reticulocyte % x (Actual Hb / Normal Hb) Plugging in the values given in the question, CRC = 9% x 5/15 = 3% Alternatively, CRC can be calculated using hematocrit (PCV) as follows: CRC = Reticulocyte % x (Actual PCV / Normal PCV) For these calculations, take normal Hb as 15g/dL and normal PCV as 45%. The patient's hemoglobin level (5 g/dL) is significantly lower than the normal hemoglobin level (15 g/dL). To obtain an accurate assessment of reticulocyte production relative to the reduced number of circulating red blood cells, a correction factor has to be applied. CRC accounts for the anemia and provides a more precise estimate of the reticulocyte count. When polychromatophilic macrocytes (prematurely released reticulocytes/shift cells) are observed in the peripheral blood smear, a second correction is applied to account for the longer life of reticulocytes to yield reticulocyte production index (RPI). In the classification of anemia, the patient's reticulocyte count is compared to the expected reticulocyte response. Reticulocytes can be identified by staining their ribosomal RNA with a supravital dye, resulting in the formation of blue or black punctate spots. They can be quantified manually or by using fluorescent dyes. The presence of reticulocytes indicates active red cell production. The premature release of reticulocytes is typically associated with increased EPO stimulation. In hemolytic anemia, red cell production can increase six to seven times. If the RPI < 2 in a patient with anemia, a defect in erythroid marrow proliferation or maturation has to be suspected.",

The normal range of RDW is 11-14%. In the presence of uneven cell size (anisocytosis), the RDW increases to 15-18%. RDW has clinical utility in two main scenarios: In cases of microcytic anemia (low MCV), it helps differentiate between iron deficiency and thalassemia. Thalassemia is characterized by uniformly small red blood cells with a normal RDW, while iron deficiency leads to greater size variability and an increased RDW. A high RDW can indicate dimorphic anemia caused by chronic atrophic gastritis. Vitamin B12 malabsorption results in macrocytic anemia and blood loss leads to iron deficiency (microcytic anemia).",

In patients with absolute polycythemia, erythropoietin (EPO) levels must be measured. Primary polycythemia - low or normal EPO levels Secondary polycythemia - elevated EPO levels",

Along with glucocorticoids, the other management of APL differentiation syndrome includes chemotherapy for cytoreduction and supportive measures.

While ATRA reduces the incidence of DIC associated with cytarabine and daunorubicin used earlier in APL, it can cause APL differentiation syndrome due to the adhesion of differentiated neoplastic cells to the pulmonary vasculature endothelium. In low-risk APL patients with a low leukocyte count at presentation, a combination of ATRA and arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been found to be superior and is the current standard of care.",

The therapeutic benefit of stem cell transplant in hematological malignancies is due to the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL). Donor T lymphocytes attack malignant hematopoietic stem cells of the recipient that remain after high-dose chemotherapy. Despite having a low rate of graft versus host disease (GvHD), stem cells from an identical twin do not have a desirable degree of GvL effect, leading to higher rates of recurrence post-transplant. Option B: Autologous (umbilical cord transplant) is not recommended as higher rates of relapse have been reported. Option D: An HLA identical sibling is preferred over an unrelated HLA identical donor because there is a greater chance of matching for minor histocompatibility complex (mHC). This reduces the risk of GvHD. ABO compatibility is also important to consider, but a minor ABO mismatch (Rh mismatch) doesn't have any impact on hemolysis, graft-versus-host disease, or survival.",

The formation of inhibitor/ alloantibodies to FVIII or FIX is the major complication of hemophilia treatment. When this happens, patients do not respond to factor replacement at therapeutic doses. aPTT measurement is done on a mixed sample. It is used to determine the presence of factor VIII inhibitors. aPTT is estimated using a 1:1 mix of patient's plasma and normal plasma. It is interpreted as: In hemophilia, aPTT is corrected with a 1:1 mix. In patients with inhibitors, aPTT with 1:1 mix is abnormally prolonged (inhibitor neutralizes th normal factors). Bethesda assay is based on the same principle but is superior because it helps to quantify the type and specificity of the inhibitor. Option A: 1,3 beta D glucan assay is designed to diagnose invasive fungal infections (IFIs). Options B and C: It is used to diagnose heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.",

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an acquired syndrome characterized by the widespread activation of blood clotting factors within blood vessels, resulting in a loss of clotting control. The primary mechanism of DIC involves the uncontrolled generation of thrombin through multiple pathways which leads to sustained coagulation activation, the formation of fibrin, and the consumption of clotting factors and platelets. Infections are the most frequent cause of DIC. Laboratory investigations in DIC: Decreased platelet count Prolonged PT/TT Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) Decreased fibrinogen Elevated fibrin degradation products (D-dimers) Peripheral smear: microangiopathic hemolytic anemia in DIC with schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) The treatment involves platelet transfusion when platelet counts are below 10,000-20,000/L. Replacement of fibrinogen and coagulation factors is with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) along with cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate.

Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS): Patients with HIV-related TB may experience a temporary paradoxical exacerbation of symptoms and radiographic manifestations of TB after starting ATT. This occurs as a result of immune reconstitution due to simultaneous administration of ART and ATT. It is characterized by high fever, lymphadenopathy, expanding intra-thoracic lesions, and worsening of chest X-ray findings. Diagnosis should be made only after ruling out treatment failure and other infections. For severe cases, prednisone 1-2mg/kg is used for 1-2 weeks and then gradually tapered. However, in patients with CD4 <50/L, the benefits of administering ART immediately after initiating ATT outweigh the risks of IRIS, and therefore ART should be started as early as possible. Note: As per RNTCP guidelines, CBNAAT is the preferred diagnostic technique for testing TB in PLHIV (people living with HIV).

The coronavirus spike protein mediates coronavirus entry into host cells. Each spike protein has two distinct subunits S1 and S2. S1 subunit is responsible for binding to the specific receptor (ACE 2) on the host cell surface facilitating viral attachment to the surface of target cells. S2 subunit drives the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. The host protease enzymes, mainly transmembrane protease serine-type 2 (TMPRSS2) cleave the spike protein.

The gold standard for its diagnosis is the identification of viral genome targets in the respiratory tract materials by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during the first week of symptoms. RT-PCR involves the reverse transcription of the genetic material of the virus (RNA) to complementary DNA (cDNA), followed by amplification of some regions of the cDNA. Four regions of the SARS CoV2 genome are used as targets: RdRp gene (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) Genes from structural proteins E (virus envelope) N (virus nucleocapsid), ORF1ab gene (open reading frame 1a and 1b) CBNAAT (cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test) uses small, chip-based, portable, battery-operated devices that detect target genetic material of SARS CoV2. Examples include TrueNat and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2 Options A and B: Antibody testing- Antibodies of IgA, IgM, and IgG isotypes specific to different virus proteins are detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA). CLIA is more sensitive compared to ELISA. Option C: Rapid antigen test (RAT)- Antigen-based assays are used as point-of-care tests for early detection of SARS-CoV-2. They are used at the field level for early detection of infection and quick containment. Most of such tests have relatively moderate sensitivity but high specificity.

GGO are hazy areas with slightly increased density in the lungs without obscuration of underlying bronchial and vascular margins. The image given below shows a CT scan with bilateral GGO in the lower lobe and an air bronchogram (arrow) in the left subpleural area. Air bronchograms appear like air-filled bronchi within a highly attenuated parenchymal background. These are dilated bronchi filled with mucus plugs and do not truly contain air. The image given below shows a CT scan with multiple consolidation areas and interlobular septal thickening (arrows) in both lungs. The pulmonary interstitial structures such as interlobular septa and intralobular lines can thicken and manifest as small linear opacities. The image given below shows a CT scan with crazy-paving pattern (circled area). It is defined as the presence of GGOs with superimposed interlobular septal thickening giving the appearance of irregular paving stones. The image given below shows a CT scan with multiple lesions with reversed halo sign (arrows). The reversed halo sign or atoll sign is the presence of a ring-like area of consolidation with a superimposed rounded GGO.",

Pernio / chilblains are skin lesions on the acral surfaces of the body characterised by the development of erythematous-violaceous or purpuric macules. They may be accompanied by edema and pruritus. It is usually due to cold exposure or underlying hematological disorders but has also been reported in patients with COVID-19 disease. The underlying mechanism is thought to be an inflammatory process. The lesions appear late (postviral phase) with the patients exhibiting positive IgM/ IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 and negative RT-PCR. However, pernio like lesions can also be seen in early stages of the disease when the patients are still infective. There are no treatment guidelines but high-potency topical corticosteroids may be helpful if the lesions are causing discomfort. Other cutaneous manifestations include exanthematous rash, livedo reticularis, urticaria, MIS-C etc.",
