ARDS is characterized by hypoxemia refractory to oxygen therapy, decreased lung compliance,interstitial edema progressing to diffuse alveolar infiltrates and absence of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. In ARDS diffuse injury to pulmonary microvascular endothelium or alveolar epithelium results in a leaky alveolocapillary membrane.In acute stage lungs are heavy,red and boggy. The interstitial and intra alveolar edema,inflammation and fibrin deposition cause alveoli to become lined with waxy hyaline membranes.
