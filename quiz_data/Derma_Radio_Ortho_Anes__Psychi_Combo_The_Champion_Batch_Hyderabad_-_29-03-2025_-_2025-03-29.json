B. 3 min</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Preoxygenation or denitrogenation is the process of replacing nitrogen in the lungs with oxygen. This is typically done by giving 100% oxygen to the patient for 3 minutes through a tight-fitting mask or by asking them to take 8 vital capacity breaths. This process helps to lengthen the apnea time, providing an improved margin of safety while the anesthesiologist secures the airway and resumes ventilation.</li><li>\u2022 There are two main methods commonly used for preoxygenation:</li><li>\u2022 The first method involves utilizing tidal volume ventilation through a face mask for a duration of 3 minutes. This technique allows for the exchange of approximately 95% of the gas present in the lungs. The second method relies on vital capacity breaths to achieve effective preoxygenation in a shorter time frame. While four breaths over 30 seconds are not as efficient as the tidal volume method, it may still be deemed acceptable in specific clinical scenarios. Research has indicated that eight breaths over a span of 60 seconds are more effective for preoxygenation.</li><li>\u2022 The first method involves utilizing tidal volume ventilation through a face mask for a duration of 3 minutes.
