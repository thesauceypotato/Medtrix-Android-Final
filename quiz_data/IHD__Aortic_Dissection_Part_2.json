For mechanical support in a recovering heart, the options used are IABP, ECMO, or VAD. If low cardiac output persists despite inotropic support, the heart requires mechanical support while it recovers its function. This includes an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), ventricular assist device (VAD), & extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). CPB is used in Cardiac Procedures and it has other Alternative uses.

IABP is a device that is inserted, either percutaneously or under direct vision, into the common femoral artery. The balloon is triggered by the ECG.

VAD is a mechanical circulatory supporting device used to replace the function of a failing heart partially or completely. It can be used for the short or long term. Option: C.

The Complications of Aortic Dissection are due to the Extension of the tear Proximally OR Distally. The dissection can extend distally down the aorta to involve: The renal arteries (renal pain and renal failure); The mesenteric arteries (abdominal pain and bowel ischemia); The iliac arteries (leg pain, pallor, loss or reduced pulses & limb ischemia). The dissection may track proximally to involve.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option B . The spinal arteries (paraplegia); Option A. The head and neck vessels (symptoms and signs of a stroke or TIA); The coronary vessels (MI); Option C. The aortic root (aortic regurgitation). The dissection may also result in aortic wall rupture into the pericardium (cardiac tamponade) or mediastinum (left Hemothorax).</p>\n<p></p>",
