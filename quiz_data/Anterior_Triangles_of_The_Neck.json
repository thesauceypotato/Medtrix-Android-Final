      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Acromioclavicular ligament The acromioclavicular ligament connects the clavicle to the coracoid process of the scapula . Separation of the shoulder (dislocation of the acromioclavicular [AC] joint) is associated with damage to the acromioclavicular ligament (capsule of the AC joint) and, in more severe injuries, disruption of the coracoclavicular ligaments (conoid and trapezoid portions). The glenohumeral ligament may be injured by an anterior dislocation of the humerus but is not likely to be injured by a separated shoulder. The coracoacromial ligament, transverse scapular ligament, and tendon of the long head of triceps brachii are not likely to be injured by separation of the shoulder</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel The median nerve also provides motor innervation to muscles of the thenar eminence. The median nerve supplies sensory innervation to the thumb, index, and middle fingers and to the ring finger's lateral half. Compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel explains these deficits in conjunction with the normal functioning of the flexor compartment of the forearm because these muscles are innervated by the median nerve proximal to the carpal tunnel. The ulnar nerve is not implicated in these symptoms. It does not provide sensation to digits 1 to 3. Compression of the brachial plexus could not be attributed to pressure from the triceps because this muscle is located distal to the plexus. In addition, brachial plexus symptoms would include other upper limb deficits rather than the focal symptoms described in this case. Osteoarthritis of the cervical spine would also lead to increasing complexity of symptoms.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1,2,4 The deep fascia of the neck is condensed to form the following layers: Investing layer Pretracheal fascia Prevertebral fascia Carotid sheath Buccopharyngeal fascia Pharyngobasilar fascia. INVESTING LAYER It lies deep to the platysma, and surrounds the neck like a collar. It forms the roof of the posterior triangle of the neck. PRETRACHEAL FASCIA The importance of this fascia is that it encloses and suspends the thyroid gland and forms its false capsule. It is continuous with buccopharyngeal fascia. PREVERTEBRAL FASCIA It lies in front of the prevertebral muscles, and forms the floor of the posterior triangle of the neck. As the trunks of the brachial plexus and the subclavian artery pass laterally through the interval between the scalenus anterior and the scalenus medius, they carry with them a covering of the prevertebral fascia known as the axillary sheath which extends into the axilla. CAROTID SHEATH It is a condensation of the fibroareolar tissue around the main vessels of the neck. BUCCOPHARYNGEAL FASCIA This fascia covers all the constrictor muscles externally and extends onto the superficial aspect of the buccinator muscle. PHARYNGOBASILAR FASCIA This fascia is especially thickened between the upper border of superior constrictor muscle and the base of the skull. It lies deep to the pharyngeal muscles.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>C The area marked as C is known as the dangerous space of the neck; the danger space lies between the alar and prevertebral fascia and extends from the skull base down to the posterior mediastinum, where the alar, visceral and prevertebral layers of deep cervical fascia fuse. The potential space so created is closed superiorly, inferiorly and laterally; infections can only enter by penetrating its walls. The danger space is so called because its loose areolar tissue offers a potential route for the rapid downward spread of infection, primarily from the retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal or prevertebral spaces, to the posterior mediastinum. = Prevertebral Space = Retropharyngeal Space = Pretracheal Space Prevertebral tissue space is the potential space between the prevertebral fascia and the vertebral column. It extends from the skull base to the coccyx and encloses the prevertebral muscles. Almost all pathology affecting the prevertebral space arises from either the adjacent vertebrae or their intervertebral discs or the spinal cord and associated nerve roots and spinal nerves. Tuberculosis of the spine may breach the space and form a Pott\u2019s abscess. The posterior visceral space is often called the retropharyngeal space in the upper neck. The posterior visceral space lies posterior to the pharynx and cervical oesophagus, extending from the skull base down to the superior mediastinum, its caudal limit being the fusion level between the alar and visceral layers of fascia. Pretracheal Space is also known as anterior visceral space. The visceral division of the middle layer of deep cervical fascia encloses the anterior visceral space, a surgical and radiological term also traditionally (and confusingly) called the \u2018pretracheal\u2019 space. It contains the trachea, the thyroid and parathyroid glands, the larynx, the cervical oesophagus, recurrent laryngeal nerves and the cranial sympathetic trunks. The space extends superiorly from the hyoid bone and the attachments of the strap muscles and their fasciae to the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage down into the anterior portion of the superior mediastinum. It communicates freely with the posterior visceral space around the sides of the larynx, the caudal portion of the pharynx and the upper cervical oesophagus but becomes separated from the posterior visceral space at lower levels by dense connective tissue associated with the inferior thyroid artery as the latter approaches the thyroid gland. Infection usually spreads into the anterior visceral space by either perforation of the anterior wall of the oesophagus by endoscopic instrumentation, foreign bodies or trauma or from the posterior visceral space. Radiologically, the portion of the anterior visceral space between the strap fascia and the fascia of the thyroid gland is referred to as the anterior cervical space; its posterolateral border is either the carotid sheath or the fascia covering the sternocleidomastoid. The anterior cervical space often provides a symmetric landmark on transverse imaging.</p>\n<p></p>",
