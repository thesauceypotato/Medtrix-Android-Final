He states that the symptoms have been occurring episodically but increasing in frequency. The ringing in his ears was not present initially but has become more prominent. He denies any recent ear infections or trauma. He is not taking any medications. On examination, he is noted to have low-frequency hearing loss. The remainder of the examination is normal.
