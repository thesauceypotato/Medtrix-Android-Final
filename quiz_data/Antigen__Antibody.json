They play an essential role in Immunogenic memory. Helper T Cells play an important role in the recognition of T Cell dependent antigens and also Immunogenic memory. Option B. Activation of macrophages T helper cells play an essential role in the activation of macrophages and granuloma formation in in granulomatous inflammation. Option C. Activation of cytotoxic T Cells</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>CD8-positive T cells are a critical subpopulation of MHC class I-restricted T cell and are mediators of adaptive immunity. They include cytotoxic T cells, which are important for killing cancerous or virally infected cells, and CD8-positive suppressor T cells, which restrain certain types of immune response.</p>\n<p></p>",
