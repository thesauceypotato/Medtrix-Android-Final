      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma: Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is a B-cell neoplasm of older adults that usually presents in the sixth or seventh decade of life . Although superficially resembling CLL/SLL, it differs in that a substantial fraction of the tumour cells undergo terminal differentiation to plasma cells . Most commonly, the plasma cell component secretes monoclonal IgM , often in amounts sufficient to cause a hyperviscosity syndrome known as Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia . Unlike multiple myeloma, complications stemming from the secretion of free light chains (e.g. Renal failure and amyloidosis) are relatively rare, and bone destruction does NOT occur .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mutation: MYD 88 Most common genetic abnormality: Deletion of 6q Patients with IgM-secreting tumours have additional signs and symptoms stemming from the physicochemical properties of IgM. It gives rise to a hyperviscosity syndrome characterized by the following: Visual impairment associated with venous congestion, reflected by striking tortuosity and distention of retinal veins; retinal haemorrhages and exudates may also contribute to visual problems. Neurologic problems such as headaches, dizziness, deafness, and stupor, all stemming from sluggish blood flow. Bleeding is related to the formation of complexes between macroglobulins and clotting factors as well as interference with platelet function. Cryoglobulinemia results from the precipitation of macroglobulins at low temperatures, producing symptoms such as the Raynaud phenomenon and cold urticaria.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Mycosis fungoides. Mycosis fungoides and S\u00e9zary syndrome are different manifestations of a tumour of CD4+ helper T cells that are home to the skin. Option: B: Smoldering myeloma. M protein is > 3.5 g/dL, Plasma cells in the bone marrow are > 10% and the patient is asymptomatic. Option: C. Primary effusion lymphoma. Primary effusion lymphoma presents as a malignant pleural or ascitic effusion , mostly in patients with advanced HIV infection or in older adults. The tumour cells are often anaplastic in appearance and typically fail to express surface B- or T-cell markers , but have clonal IGH gene rearrangements . In all cases, the tumour cells are infected with HHV-8, which appears to have a causal role .</p>\n<p></p>",

In contrast to myeloma, the disease was associated with lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, but the major clinical manifestation was hyperviscosity syndrome . The disease resembles the related diseases CLL, myeloma, and lymphocytic lymphoma. It originates from a post-germinal centre B cell that has undergone somatic mutations and antigenic selection in the lymphoid follicle and has the characteristics of an IgM-bearing memory B cell. The presence of MYD88 mutation status is now used as a diagnostic test to discriminate WM from marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs), IgM-secreting myeloma, and CLL with plasmacytic differentiation. Like multiple myeloma , the disease involves the bone marrow , but unlike myeloma, it does NOT cause bone lesions or hypercalcemia . Bone marrow shows >10% infiltration with lymphoplasmacytic cells ( surface IgM+, CD19+, CD20+, and CD22+, rarely CD5+, but CD10\u2212 and CD23\u2212 ) with an increase in the number of mast cells.
