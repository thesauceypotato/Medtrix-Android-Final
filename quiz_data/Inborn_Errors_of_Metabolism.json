      "text": "A 6-month-old male infant is brought by his parents to a primary healthcare center in a semi-urban area of India. The parents are concerned about their child's lack of response to stimuli and inability to support his head, which they noticed was significantly different from their older child at this age. They also mention that the infant has had episodes described as \"startles\" that seemed abnormal and unlike typical infant reflexes. On physical examination, the physician notes the infant's peculiar hair, which is sparse, kinky, and depigmented, along with loose skin folds, microcephaly, and a pronounced forehead. Given these findings and considering the rural Indian healthcare setting where genetic testing facilities are rare, the physician recalls a rare disease of copper metabolism linked to the ATP7A gene mutation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "text": "A worried mother rushes her 1-year-old son to the emergency department of a district hospital in India, reporting that her child has just experienced a convulsive episode. She mentions that the child was healthy at birth and reached early developmental milestones on time, but she has been increasingly concerned about his slow growth and a persistent rash that she describes as similar to eczema. Upon examination, the emergency physician notes the distinctive eczematous rash and also detects a \"mousy\" odor in the child's urine, raising suspicion for a metabolic disorder. Given the combination of developmental concerns, seizure, eczematoid rash, and characteristic urine odor, which condition is most likely, and how should the diagnosis be confirmed?",
