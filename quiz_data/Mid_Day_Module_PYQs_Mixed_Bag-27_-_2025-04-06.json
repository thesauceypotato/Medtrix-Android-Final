The clinical history provided in the question strongly suggests neonatal herpes infection. The mother had a history of painful vesicular lesions over the genitalia, which is characteristic of genital herpes caused by HSV2. Neonatal herpes can be transmitted from the mother to the baby during childbirth if the mother has an active HSV infection. The baby presented with symptoms of meningitis, fever, and rash, which are typical manifestations of neonatal herpes. The presence of multinucleated giant cells on scrapings from lesions further supports the diagnosis, as these are characteristic findings in herpes infections.</li><li>\u2022 The correct answer is HSV2 (Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2).

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. D. Secondary active transport</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 Glucose is absorbed into the intestine by secondary active transport because this process allows for the efficient uptake of glucose against its concentration gradient.</li><li>\u2022 Secondary active transport involves the coupled movement of two substances across a membrane, where the movement of one substance is dependent on the electrochemical gradient created by the movement of another substance. In the case of glucose absorption in the intestine, the secondary active transport mechanism relies on the sodium gradient created by the sodium-potassium pump.</li><li>\u2022 The process of glucose absorption in the intestine occurs in the brush border membrane of the intestinal epithelial cells, specifically in the small intestine. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how secondary active transport facilitates glucose absorption:</li><li>\u2022 Sodium-Potassium Pump: The sodium-potassium pump actively transports sodium ions (Na+) out of the epithelial cells and into the intercellular space, using ATP energy. This creates a concentration gradient where the sodium concentration is higher outside the cell. Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter: The sodium gradient generated by the sodium-potassium pump is utilized by a specific protein called the sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT). This cotransporter binds both sodium ions and glucose molecules on the outer surface of the cell. Co-transport of Sodium and Glucose: As sodium ions bind to the SGLT protein, their movement into the cell down the concentration gradient provides the necessary energy for the simultaneous movement of glucose against its concentration gradient. Glucose is \"dragged\" along with the sodium ions as they enter the cell. Glucose Transporter: Once inside the epithelial cell, glucose is transported across the basolateral membrane (the inner surface of the cell) and into the bloodstream by facilitated diffusion through a specific glucose transporter called GLUT2.</li><li>\u2022 Sodium-Potassium Pump: The sodium-potassium pump actively transports sodium ions (Na+) out of the epithelial cells and into the intercellular space, using ATP energy. This creates a concentration gradient where the sodium concentration is higher outside the cell.</li><li>\u2022 Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter: The sodium gradient generated by the sodium-potassium pump is utilized by a specific protein called the sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT). This cotransporter binds both sodium ions and glucose molecules on the outer surface of the cell.</li><li>\u2022 Co-transport of Sodium and Glucose: As sodium ions bind to the SGLT protein, their movement into the cell down the concentration gradient provides the necessary energy for the simultaneous movement of glucose against its concentration gradient. Glucose is \"dragged\" along with the sodium ions as they enter the cell.</li><li>\u2022 Glucose Transporter: Once inside the epithelial cell, glucose is transported across the basolateral membrane (the inner surface of the cell) and into the bloodstream by facilitated diffusion through a specific glucose transporter called GLUT2.</li><li>\u2022 Overall, the energy stored in the sodium gradient created by the sodium-potassium pump is used to actively transport both sodium and glucose into the intestinal epithelial cells. This secondary active transport mechanism allows for the absorption of glucose from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream efficiently, even when the concentration of glucose is higher inside the cell than in the lumen.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Primary active transport : Incorrect because primary active transport involves the direct use of ATP to move substances against their gradient, which does not apply to glucose absorption in this context.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Primary active transport</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Facilitated diffusion : Incorrect as this method does not involve the active transport of glucose against its concentration gradient; it only allows movement along the gradient.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Facilitated diffusion</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Simple diffusion : Incorrect because simple diffusion does not involve any transport proteins and occurs only along the concentration gradient, which is not sufficient for glucose absorption in the intestine.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Simple diffusion</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Glucose absorption in the intestine occurs via secondary active transport, utilizing the energy from the sodium gradient created by the sodium-potassium ATPase to transport glucose against its concentration gradient.
