Uptake of nitrous oxide by blood decreases the lung volume leading to the concentration of the remaining nitrous oxide in the lung. Moreover, this uptake will create a gradient that draws more nitrous oxide from the machine thus increasing the alveolar concentration more than expected; this is known as the concentration effect.
