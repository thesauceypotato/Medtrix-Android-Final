The C gene has two initiation codons: a precore and a core region. If translation is initiated at the precore region ,the protein product is HBeAg , which has a signal peptide that binds it to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the secretory apparatus of the cell, leading to its secretion into the circulation. If translation begins at the core region , HBcAg is the protein product Option: B. HBcAg has no signal peptide and is not secreted, but it assembles into nucleocapsid particles, which bind to and incorporate RNA, and which, ultimately, contain HBV DNA. The antigen expressed on the surface of the nucleocapsid core is hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) , and its corresponding antibody is anti-HBc. Option: D. Recent and remote HBV infections can be distinguished by determination of the immunoglobulin class of anti-HBc. Anti-HBc of the IgM class (IgM anti-HBc) predominates during the first 6 months after acute infection, whereas IgG anti-HBc is the predominant class of anti-HBc beyond 6 months . Therefore, patients with current or recent acute hepatitis B, including those in the anti-HBc window, have IgM anti-HBc in their serum. In patients who have recovered from hepatitis B in the remote past as well as those with chronic HBV infection, anti-HBc is predominantly of the IgG class.</p>\n<p></p>",

For perinatal exposure of infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers, a single dose of HBIG, 0. 5 mL, should be administered IM in the thigh immediately after birth, followed by a complete course of three injections of recombinant hepatitis B vaccines approved for children to be started within the first 12 h of life. Direct percutaneous inoculation or transmucosal exposure to HBsAg-positive blood or body fluids (e. g. , accidental needle stick, other mucosal penetration, or ingestion), a single IM dose of HBIG, 0. 06 mL/kg, administered as soon after exposure as possible, is followed by a complete course of hepatitis B vaccine to begin within the first week. For pregnant mothers with high-level HBV DNA (>2 \u00d7 105 IU/mL), adding antiviral nucleoside analogues (e. g. , pregnancy class B tenofovir) during the third trimester of pregnancy reduces perinatal transmission even further. Sexual contact exposure to a patient with acute hepatitis B, a single IM dose of HBIG, 0. 06 mL/kg, should be given within 14 days of exposure , to be followed by a complete course of hepatitis B vaccine. When both HBIG and hepatitis B vaccines are recommended, they may be given at the same time but at separate sites.</p>\n<p></p>",
