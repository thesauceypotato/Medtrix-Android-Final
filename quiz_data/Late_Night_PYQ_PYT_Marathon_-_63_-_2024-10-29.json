      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. D. Attached to pelvic brim</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The levator ani is not attached to the pelvic brim. Instead, it originates from the posterior surface of the body of the pubis, the obturator fascia, and the ischial spine. It then inserts into the coccyx, anococcygeal ligament, and walls of the prostate or vagina, rectum, and anal canal. The incorrect notion about its attachment to the pelvic brim is a common misconception.</li><li>\u2022 Insertion :- The coccyx and the anococcygeal raphe or ligament. Nerve supply:- The branches of the anterior rami of sacral nerves S3 and S4 and the perineal branch of the pudendal nerve. Supports and raises the pelvic floor. Consists of the puborectalis, pubococcygeus, and iliococcygeus.</li><li>\u2022 Insertion :- The coccyx and the anococcygeal raphe or ligament.</li><li>\u2022 Insertion :-</li><li>\u2022 Nerve supply:- The branches of the anterior rami of sacral nerves S3 and S4 and the perineal branch of the pudendal nerve.</li><li>\u2022 Nerve supply:-</li><li>\u2022 Supports and raises the pelvic floor.</li><li>\u2022 Consists of the puborectalis, pubococcygeus, and iliococcygeus.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A . Supports pelvic viscera : This statement is correct. The levator ani, along with other pelvic floor muscles, forms a supportive sling for the pelvic organs such as the bladder, uterus (in females), and rectum. This muscular support is essential for maintaining continence and facilitating functions such as micturition and defecation.</li><li>\u2022 Option A</li><li>\u2022 Supports pelvic viscera</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Converge downwards and medially : This statement is also correct. The fibers of the levator ani muscles, especially from the pubococcygeus, tend to converge towards the midline and run in a downward direction. This orientation provides the necessary support to the pelvic organs and creates a muscular barrier between the pelvic cavity and the perineum.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.</li><li>\u2022 Converge downwards and medially</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Consists of iliococcygeus and pubococcygeus : This statement is partially true. The levator ani is made up of three parts: the puborectalis, pubococcygeus, and iliococcygeus. All three parts contribute to the function and support provided by the levator ani.
