Acute GVHD usually occurs within the first three months after an allogeneic transplant with a peak onset of around four weeks and is characterised by an erythematous maculopapular rash, persistent anorexia or diarrhoea, or both; and by liver disease with increased serum levels of bilirubin, alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. In all these organs, endothelial damage and lymphocytic infiltrates are seen. Factors associated with a greater risk of acute GVHD include HLA-mismatching between recipient and donor, patient and donor age, more intense preparative regimens and use of multiparous women as donors.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Type IV- This reaction is mediated by T cells, not antibodies, leading to an inflammatory response against the allergen.

The histamine release causes vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction (g., bronchospasm). Antihistamine drugs can block histamine receptor sites and are relatively effective in allergic rhinitis. Histamine is one of the primary mediators of a type I reaction. Prostaglandins and leukotrienes\u2014Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are newly formed mediators derived from arachidonic acid via the cyclooxygenase pathway. Prostaglandins induce oedema and bronchoconstriction. Leukotriene B4 is a chemoattractant that activates and recruits\u2019 leukocytes to the injury site. Leukotrienes C4 (OPTION C) and D4 cause vasodilation and vascular permeability. These mediators, along with TNF-\u03b1 (OPTION A) and IL-4 (OPTION B alternate), are referred to as secondary mediators of a type I reaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>IL-2 is critical for the development of Tregs in the thymus and the regulation, proliferation, and maintenance of Tregs in peripheral tissues, and is essential for maintaining the transcriptional program required for Treg function.</p>\n<p></p>",
