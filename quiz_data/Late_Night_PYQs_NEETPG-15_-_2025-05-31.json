While older guidelines or some regions may have used the live attenuated SA 14-14-2 vaccine given subcutaneously, updated practices now favor the inactivated IM vaccine due to its broader safety profile and compatibility with adult vaccination. Always refer to the most recent national immunization guidelines when answering such public health\u2013related MCQs.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

The superior head attaches to the articular disc and the capsule of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). This muscle plays a crucial role in the opening of the mouth, protrusion of the mandible, and moving the jaw from side to side. Dysfunction or spasms of this muscle could contribute to jaw locking during yawning. The lateral pterygoid is, therefore, closely associated with the movements and function of the TMJ.</li><li>\u2022 All Innervated by CN V 3</li><li>\u2022 All Innervated by CN V 3</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Medial pterygoid: The medial pterygoid muscle is similar in function to the masseter muscle and helps in elevating the mandible, thus assisting in closing the mouth. It also plays a role in moving the jaw from side to side. However, like the temporalis, it doesn't directly attach to the articular disc of the TMJ.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Medial pterygoid:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Masseter: The masseter muscle is one of the primary muscles of mastication (chewing). It originates from the zygomatic arch and inserts onto the lateral aspect of the mandibular angle and ramus. Its primary function is to elevate the mandible, assisting in closing the mouth. It does not have an attachment to the articular disc of the TMJ but is important for jaw function.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
