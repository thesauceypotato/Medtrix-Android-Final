The patient recalls getting tick bites in the woods but initially had no symptoms. He began experiencing fever, chills, malaise, headache, and myalgia a week after his return. Physical examination shows a diffuse, maculopapular rash; clear oropharynx; normal lung and heart sounds; and mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing reveals leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated aminotransferase levels. Microscopic evaluation of the blood demonstrates mulberry-shaped, intracytoplasmic inclusions in monocytes as shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely pathogen responsible for this patient's condition?",
