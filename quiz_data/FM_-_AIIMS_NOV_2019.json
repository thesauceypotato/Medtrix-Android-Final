      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Residual from barrel of gun As Bullet passes through the barrel , the dirt & grease substance (used for barrel lubrication), gets smeared on the bullet surface. So this bullet, now carrying the dirt and grease, as it enters the body, wipes itself off (so called bullet wipe ) .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Bullet wipe- Bullet wipe is also called Grease collar or Dirt collar. A \"bullet wipe\" is a dark ring around the perimeter of the entrance in a target. The ring is formed by and contains bullet lubricant , by-products of propellant , traces of bullet metal , and residue in the gun barrel from previous use. As Bullet passes through the barrel, the dirt & grease substance (used for barrel lubrication), gets smeared on the bullet So this bullet, now carrying the dirt and grease , as it enters the body, wipes itself off (so called bullet wipe) the dirt and grease from its surface, onto the skin around the entry wound . This creates a ring of dirt or grease around the entry wound , called Grease / Dirt collar. Around the wound of entry, first is Grease collar & surrounding it will be abrasion collar.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Blackening - The deposition of smoke / soot around the entry wound is called Blackening / smudging / soiling. It can be easily wiped off with a wet sponge. Option C. Gutter fracture of skull -Long and Narrow fracture Seen with bullet glance / graze /slap of skull. Option D. Tattooing -Partly burnt/unburnt gun powder particles.Around entry wound, they are adherent to the skin. It cannot be wiped away and felt as This is called tattooing / stippling / peppering.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is well established by 36 to 48 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Decomposition/putrefaction: Colour changes: The earliest sign of decomposition is greenish discoloration of the body, seen first in the right iliac fossa externally and under the liver internally ( because in caecum , the contents are more liquid and are full of bacteria.) . In these areas, It appears in 12-18 hours, and slowly spread on whole body in 24-48 hr. greenish discoloration is due to formation of Sulph meth haemoglobin. Hb\u2192 meth Hb\u2192 +H2S\u2192 Sulph meth haemoglobin. Later colour may change to purple, brown, bluish green or even almost black ( colour black is due to ferric sulphide.) The colouring matter (Hb) dissociates from the B.C. and the colour is taken up by the blood vessels, which are seen as prominent lines having purple, green or brown colour, especially on shoulders, axilla & Inguinal area.

Option C.Algor mortis -Cooling of body after death . because, Metabolisms of body stopped, no energy is produced, hence body cools. Option D.Post mortem lividity -It is purplish blue or purplish red discoloration seen under the skin in the most superficial layers of dermis, on dependent parts of the body after death due to capillo-venous distension.</p>\n<p></p>",

ASV is the mainstay of treatment. It is lypohilised e. freeze dried and reconstituted . Sensitivity testing should be done by injecting 1 ml intradermally. Given within 4hr of bite. Treatment of absorbed venom- Neurotoxic envenomation: \u2018Atropine Neostigmine (AN) \u2019effective for postsynaptic neurotoxins such as those of the Krait affects presynaptic fibres where calcium ions act as neurotransmitters. Give Calcium gluconate and continue till neuroparalysis recovers which may last for 5-7 days. Viper bite -Give heparin and fibrinogen .
