      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>14 To calculate the net filtration pressure (NFP), we use the formula: NFP = (PGC - \u03c0GC) - PBC where: PGC = Glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure \u03c0GC = Glomerular capillary osmotic pressure (colloid osmotic pressure) PBC = Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure Given the data: PGC = 42 mmHg \u03c0GC = 12 mmHg PBC = 16 mmHg Now, let's plug in the values: NFP = (42 - 12) - 16 NFP = 30 - 16 NFP = 14 mmHg The net filtration pressure is 14 mmHg. So, the correct answer is: C. 14</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hydrostatic pressure of the glomerular capillaries (P GC ): It is the only force that promotes filtration. Under normal conditions, this is the main factor that determines GFR. Hydrostatic pressure in Bowman\u2019s space (P BS ): It opposes the filtration. Normally, it is low and fairly constant and does not affect the rate of filtration. However, it increases and reduces filtration whenever there is an obstruction downstream, such as a blocked ureter or urethra (postrenal failure). Oncotic pressure of the plasma (\u03c0 GC ): It varies with the concentration of plasma proteins. Because fluid is filtered but not protein. It opposes filtration. Protein or oncotic pressure in Bowman\u2019s space (\u03c0 BS ): There is very little if any protein present, and this factor is mainly considered as zero for all practical purposes. To get net filtration pressure we need to add the filtration opposing pressures (\u03c0 GC + P BS ) and subtract it from the filtration promoting pressure (P GC ).</p>\n<p></p>",

These hormones, in turn, trigger the development of secondary sexual characteristics and the maturation of the reproductive system during puberty. Option: C.

Bronchitis may have high TLC (obstructive disease) but compliance generally remains normal or slightly higher than normal. This is a compliance curve. Left and up in the graph (A) : Indicates increased compliance. Right and down in the graph (B) : Indicates reduced compliance. Hence the answer is emphysema (increased compliance). All the other disorders mentioned have reduced compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Lung compliance Chest wall compliance Increased lung compliance Lung surfactant Lung volume: compliance is at its highest at FRC Posture (supine, upright) Loss of lung connective tissue associated with age Emphysema Increased chest wall compliance Ehler-Dahlos syndrome and other connective tissue diseases Rib resection Cachexia Flail segment rib fractures Open chest (eg clamshell) Decreased static lung compliance Loss of surfactant (eg. ARDS) Decreased lung elasticity Pulmonary fibrosis Pulmonary oedema Decreased functional lung volume Pneumonectomy or lobectomy Pneumonia Atelectasis Small stature Alveolar derecruitment Alveolar overdistension Decreased dynamic lung compliance Increased airway resistance (eg. asthma) Increased airflow (increased resp rate) Decreased chest wall compliance Structural abnormalities Kyphosis/scoliosis Pectus excavatum Circumferential burns Surgical rib fixation Functional abnormalities Muscle spasm, eg. seizure or tetanus Extrathoracic influences on chest/diaphragmatic excursion Obesity Abdominal compartment syndrome Prone position</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
