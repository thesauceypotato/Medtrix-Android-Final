It is characterized by a combination of infection, low blood pressure (hypotension), and organ dysfunction. Here are some key points about septic shock:</li><li>\u27a4 Infection : Septic shock typically begins with an infection, often caused by bacteria, but it can also result from fungal or viral infections. Common sources of infection include lung infections (pneumonia), urinary tract infections, abdominal infections, and skin infections. Systemic Inflammatory Response : In response to the infection, the body's immune system initiates a widespread inflammatory response. This response can become dysregulated, leading to an exaggerated release of inflammatory molecules (cytokines) into the bloodstream. Hypotension : One of the hallmark features of septic shock is low blood pressure (hypotension). The inflammation and vasodilation caused by the infection can lead to a drop in blood pressure, which can result in inadequate blood flow to vital organs. Organ Dysfunction : As blood pressure drops and organs receive less oxygen and nutrients, multiple organ systems can begin to fail. This can lead to dysfunction in the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, and other organs. Organ dysfunction is a critical component of septic shock and contributes to its high mortality rate. Symptoms : Symptoms of septic shock can include fever or hypothermia (low body temperature), rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, confusion, altered mental status, and signs of organ dysfunction such as respiratory distress, kidney failure, or liver dysfunction. Treatment : The treatment of septic shock is a medical emergency and involves aggressive interventions. It typically includes antibiotics to treat the underlying infection, intravenous fluids to maintain blood pressure, vasopressor medications to constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure, and supportive care in an intensive care unit (ICU).</li><li>\u27a4 Infection : Septic shock typically begins with an infection, often caused by bacteria, but it can also result from fungal or viral infections.

It is characterized by facial flushing and sweating in the region of the face associated with the parotid gland, particularly when eating or thinking about food. The underlying cause of Frey's syndrome is damage to the auriculotemporal nerve (a branch of the mandibular nerve, V3). This damage results in abnormal nerve regeneration and cross-connection between the parasympathetic fibers that stimulate salivation and the sympathetic fibers that control sweating.</li><li>\u2022 Mechanism : The auriculotemporal nerve contains both sensory fibers and parasympathetic secretomotor fibers that supply the parotid gland. Following injury or surgery, these fibers can aberrantly regenerate, causing parasympathetic fibers to innervate sweat glands of the overlying skin, leading to sweating and flushing upon salivation.</li><li>\u2022 Mechanism : The auriculotemporal nerve contains both sensory fibers and parasympathetic secretomotor fibers that supply the parotid gland.
