A) Tullio Phenomenon</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Tullio phenomenon refers to the development of vertigo and nystagmus in response to loud sounds. This occurs due to a pathological connection between the sound-conducting system and the vestibular apparatus. Loud sounds cause abnormal stimulation of the vestibular system, resulting in vestibular symptoms. This phenomenon is seen in conditions like superior semicircular canal dehiscence, perilymphatic fistula, and advanced otosyphilis where there is an abnormal communication between the inner ear fluid compartments.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Hennebert's Sign : This refers to the development of vertigo and nystagmus on applying pressure to the external auditory canal (positive fistula test) in the absence of a demonstrable fistula (false positive). It is typically seen in congenital syphilis due to the presence of fibrous adhesions between the stapes footplate and the membranous labyrinth. Unlike Tullio phenomenon which is triggered by sound, Hennebert's sign is elicited by pressure changes.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Hennebert's Sign</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Roll-over Phenomenon : This is seen in retrocochlear hearing loss (e.g., acoustic neuroma). It refers to a decrease in speech discrimination scores as the intensity of sound is increased beyond a certain level. Unlike Tullio phenomenon, it does not involve vertigo and is related to hearing discrimination rather than vestibular function.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Roll-over Phenomenon</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Recruitment Phenomenon : This is the abnormal growth of loudness perception seen in cochlear hearing loss. Patients with cochlear lesions have difficulty hearing soft sounds, but as intensity increases, they perceive loudness as rapidly growing to normal or even uncomfortable levels. This phenomenon affects hearing rather than balance and does not cause vertigo.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Recruitment Phenomenon</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Tullio phenomenon specifically describes the vestibular symptoms (vertigo and nystagmus) induced by loud sounds due to pathological communication between the sound-conducting and vestibular systems of the inner ear.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
