Given her lack of identifiable brain disease, normal EEG, absence of familial epilepsy, and positive initial response to therapy , this patient is at low risk for seizure recurrence . In addition, phenytoin is a known teratogen capable of causing fetal hydantoin syndrome .

The appropriate seizure-free interval Unknown depends on the form of epilepsy Generalized seizures have a better prognosis than focal seizures whether or not the causal factor is still present Resection of a brain tumor causing seizures Attempt withdrawal of therapy After 2 years in a patient who meets all of the above criteria Motivated to discontinue medication Understands the potential risks and benefits. Reduce the dose of the drug gradually over 2\u20133 months. Most recurrences occur in the first 3 months after discontinuing therapy Patients should be advised to avoid potentially dangerous situations such as driving or swimming during this period Up to 20% of seizure-free patients who discontinue antiseizure medications but then have a recurrent seizure may not regain full control when these medications are resumed.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A.
