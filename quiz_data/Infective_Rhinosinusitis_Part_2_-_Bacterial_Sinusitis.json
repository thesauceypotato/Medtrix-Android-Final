It is also called \u201coffice headache\u201d because of its presence only during office hours. Tenderness -Pressure upwards on the frontal sinus floor, just above the medial canthus, causes exquisite pain. It can also be elicited by tapping over the frontal sinus's anterior wall in the supraorbital region's medial part. Oedema of the upper eyelid with suffused conjunctiva and photophobia. Nasal discharge - A vertical streak of mucopus is seen high up in the anterior part of the middle meatus. This may be absent if the ostium is closed with no drainage. The nasal mucosa is inflamed in the middle meatus. X-rays - The opacity of the affected sinus or fluid level can be seen.

In Acute Ethmoidal Sinusitis, Pain is localized over the bridge of the nose, medial and deep to the eye. Movements of the eyeball aggravate it. Option: C. In Acute Sphenoidal Sinusitis Headache is usually localized to the occiput or vertex. Pain may also be referred to the mastoid region. Option: D. In Acute maxillary Sinusitis, Pain typically is situated over the upper jaw but may be referred to the gums or teeth. For this reason, the patient may primarily consult a dentist. Pain is aggravated by stooping, coughing, or chewing.</p>\n<p></p>",

Moraxella catarrhalis causes disease in a significant percentage (20%) of children but less often in adults. Other streptococcal species and Staphylococcus aureus cause only a tiny percentage of cases.
