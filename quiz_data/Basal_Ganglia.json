It is seen in the lesion of globus pallidus.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Athetosis is a symptom characterized by slow, involuntary, convoluted, writhing movements of the fingers, hands, toes, and feet and in some cases, arms, legs, neck and tongue. Movements typical of athetosis are sometimes called athetoid movements. Lesions to the brain are most often the direct cause of the symptoms, particularly to the corpus striatum . This symptom does not occur alone and is often accompanied by the symptoms of cerebral palsy, as it is often a result of this physical disability.

Option: C. intentional tremors - Intention tremor is defined as a rhythmic, oscillatory, and high amplitude tremor during a directed and purposeful motor movement, worsening before reaching the endpoint.

Hemiballismus is a rare hyperkinetic movement disorder ,that is characterized by violent involuntary limb movements, on one side of the body and can cause significant disability.Ballismus affects both sides of the body and is much rarer.Symptoms can decrease during sleep. Hemiballismus differs from chorea in that the movements occur in the proximal limbs whereas in chorea the limb movements are in the distal limbs. Also in chorea the movements are more dance-like, flowing from one region to another.</p>\n<p></p>",

Below are the few important functions of basal ganglia. Functions of Corpus Striatum The corpus striatum regulates muscle tone and thus helps in smoothening voluntary movements. It controls automatic associated movements, like the swinging of arms during walking. Similarly, it controls the coordinated movements of different parts of the body for emotional expression. It influences the precentral motor cortex which is supposed to control the extrapyramidal activities of the body. These do not receive any sensory input from the spinal cord, unlike the cerebellum. Basal ganglia contribute to the cognitive function of the brain. These help the cortex in the execution of learned patterns of movements subconsciously.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Parkinsonism (also called Parkinson's disease/paralysis agitans) This disease usually occurs after 50 years of age due to a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the corpus striatum following a lesion in the substantia nigra and/or its projections (i.e. nigrostriatal fibres). Dopamine is synthesized in the melanin-containing pigmented cells of substantia nigra and transported to the corpus striatum through nigrostriatal fibers. Dopamine causes inhibition of cells within the corpus striatum. The neurological changes in Parkinsonism appear to be a release phenomenon due to a lack of inhibitory influences following dopamine deficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Characteristic features of Parkinsonism Resting tremors , i.e. a slight shaking of hands when a person is not performing a task.

Pill-rolling movements of hands, consisting of circular movements of the opposed thumb and index fingertips is a kind of resting tremor).
