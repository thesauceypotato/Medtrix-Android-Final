      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>a, c and d The oculocephalic reflex or doll\u2019s eyes reflex involves the cranial nerves III, VI and VIII The reflex has afferents in vestibular nerve (VIII) and abducens nerve (VI) to relay in the brain stem nuclei and bring about conjugate movements of the eye through oculomotor (III) nerve This brainstem reflex is observed when the patient suddenly rotates his/her head. It is done in both the direction laterally followed by flexion and extension . In a normal person, the eyes move conjugately in the opposite direction of the movement of the head to maintain their position in space In comatose patients this reflex is not seen, hence used in the criteria for brain death.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Doll\u2019s eyes reflex has significance: Vestibular lesions - Lesions to the vestibular nerve or vestibular nuclei have been shown to impair the ipsilateral doll's eyes reflex. Psychiatric patients - Schizophrenic and bipolar patients can show abnormal smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEMs), both vertical and horizontal . However, there is evidence that these patients should show an intact doll's eyes reflex. Intensive care units - The doll's eyes reflex (oculocephalic response) in critically ill intensive care patients can independently predict altered mental status (delirium, coma, confusion) after cessation of sedation Neonates - Most neonates exhibit an unsuppressed doll's eyes reflex before 11.5 weeks; this can serve as a neonatal milestone in neurologic development.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Criteria for CNS Determination of Death (Brain Death) Irreversible coma Absence of cortical function Absence of brainstem function Apnea testing 2 examinations with interval according to patient's age</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

The flashlight is swung to and fro and the pupillary response observed. Normally, both pupils should have remained constricted in the absence of any defect. In the presence of RAPD, when the flashlight is moved from the normal to the abnormal eye, both pupils dilate. Marcus Gunn pupil is a rare condition that affects the eyes, causing each to respond differently when a light is shone into them. This response indicates that there is dysfunction or disease in the optic nerve or retina. It is a type of relative afferent pupil defect (RAPD) Causes of Optic Neuritis:- Marcus Gunn pupil is seen In optic neuritis. It is also common in retrobulbar optic neuritis due to multiple sclerosis but only for 3-4 weeks.
