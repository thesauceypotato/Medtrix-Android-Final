      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>High Urate Uric acid is a heterocyclic compound of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen with the formula C 5 H 4 N 4 O 3 . It forms ions and salts known as urates and acid urates, such as ammonium acid urate. Uric acid is a product of the metabolic breakdown of purine nucleotides, and it is a normal component of urine. High blood concentrations of uric acid can lead to gout and are associated with other medical conditions, including diabetes and the formation of ammonium acid urate kidney stones.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>SIDE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL USE High blood pressure Heart problems Elevated triglycerides Impaired sexual function Low blood sugar Vitamin and mineral deficiency Chronic fatigue Ketoacidosis Osteoporosis Gout Rhabdomyolysis Body weight control Anemia Decreased number of blood platelets Increased severity and duration of menstrual cramps</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Low lactate - Typical lactate levels are usually low, less than 2 mmol/L , ranging between 0.5-1 mmol/L. Hyperlactatemia can occur when lactate levels rise to between 2-4 mmol/L. If the levels exceed 4 mmol/L, it is known as severe hyperlactatemia. Elevated serum lactate levels can be a risk factor indicating poor prognosis. Option B. High glucose- High blood sugar , also called hyperglycemia, affects people who have diabetes. Several factors can play a role in hyperglycemia in people with diabetes. They include food and physical activity, illness, and medications not related to diabetes.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
