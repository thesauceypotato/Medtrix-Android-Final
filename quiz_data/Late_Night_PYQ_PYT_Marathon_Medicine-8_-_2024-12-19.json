Pleocytosis with high protein and low sugar</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 In cases of pneumococcal meningitis, the typical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings include pleocytosis, which is an increased number of white blood cells (WBCs), predominantly neutrophils. This inflammatory response is due to the infection caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Additionally, there is usually an elevated protein concentration in the CSF due to the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier and the presence of inflammatory proteins. The glucose level in the CSF is typically low because the bacteria consume glucose and the inflammatory response disrupts glucose transport. Therefore, the combination of pleocytosis with high protein and low sugar is characteristic of pneumococcal meningitis.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Pleocytosis with low protein and low sugar: This option is incorrect because, while pleocytosis and low sugar are typical findings, the protein level in pneumococcal meningitis is usually high, not low.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Pleocytosis with low protein and low sugar:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Lymphocytosis with low protein and low sugar: This option is incorrect because lymphocytosis, which is an increase in lymphocytes, is more characteristic of viral meningitis rather than bacterial meningitis.

Dysphagia and dysarthria occur due to involvement of the nucleus ambiguus (9th, 10th cranial nerves).
