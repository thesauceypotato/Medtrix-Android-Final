      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Methionine Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) occurs due to the inherited deficiency of branched Chain Keto-acid Decarboxylase resulting in defect in oxidative decarboxylation and catabolism of branched chain amino acids Valine, Isoleucine and leucine. As a result, these amino acids accumulate and are excreted in urine. So, for the treatment, these BCAA should be restricted in diet. Methionine is a sulphur containing amino acid and do not require this enzyme for its metabolism. So, its restriction is not required in MSUD.</p>\n<p></p>",

In pyrimidine synthesis, UMP is the first pyrimidine nucleotide to be synthesized and other two pyrimidines thymine and Cytosine are synthesized from it. Uracil to cytosine conversion requires amino group addition provided by glutamine. Uracil is converted to thymine by enzyme thymidylate synthase by methylation where methyl group is donated by methyl-THF. So, a deficiency Folate will result in thymine deficiency and may lead to uracil appearing in the DNA in place of thymine.</p>\n<p></p>",

C banding : stains heterochromatin which are regions of the chromosomes at or near centromere. So, C banding will be most useful for dicentric chromosomes. Q banding : uses quinacrine dye (first used dye) and stains repetitive AT rich regions. G-banding : is the most common banding and uses Giemsa stain to stain AT rich regions also. It is developed as an alternative to Q banding due to cumbersome nature of Q-banding. R-Banding: Reverse pattern to G-banding and stains GC rich regions instead of AT.</p>\n<p></p>",
