Hormone sensitive lipase is a catabolic enzyme present in adipose tissue cells which causes release of fatty acids from stored TG during starvation. So, it is activated by catabolic enzyme Glucagon. Lipoprotein lipase on the other hand is an anabolic enzyme and release FA from TG of VLDL and chylomicrons in fed state. Understanding the regulatory role of insulin in lipase enzymes is essential for medical students. Insulin inhibits hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) to promote fat storage and activates lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to facilitate fatty acid uptake, which helps maintain energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism in the body.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref- Harper 31 st e/p 240, 245</li><li>\u27a4 Ref- Harper 31 st e/p 240, 245</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Membranous fontanelle : The actual fontanelle is a soft spot on a baby's head where the bones of the skull have not yet fused together. It's a membranous gap between the cranial bones. Dura mater : The tough outermost membrane of the three layers of the meninges that surround the brain and spinal cord. Arachnoid mater : A thin, wispy layer that lies underneath the dura mater. Pia mater : The innermost layer of the meninges that's in direct contact with the brain's surface. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) : Once through the pia mater, the needle enters the subarachnoid space where the CSF is located.</li><li>\u2022 Scalp : This includes the skin and the underlying connective tissue of the scalp.</li><li>\u2022 Scalp</li><li>\u2022 Membranous fontanelle : The actual fontanelle is a soft spot on a baby's head where the bones of the skull have not yet fused together.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. C. Paratonsillar vein</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 In the case described, the patient likely underwent surgery for a peritonsillar abscess (aka Quinsy), a complication arising from tonsillitis. This condition can lead to significant swelling in the throat and difficulty swallowing. Post-operative bleeding in such cases, especially the continuous type noted as soaking through gauze, is most commonly associated with venous sources rather than arterial.</li><li>\u2022 The given image is a cadaveric specimen with an arrow pointing to the tonsillar fossa. The paratonsillar / external palatine vein is the typical site of venous origin for post-tonsillectomy bleeding.</li><li>\u2022 The paratonsillar vein, which is closely associated with the tonsillar bed and provides significant venous drainage for the tonsil, is the likely source of this bleeding. Venous bleeding tends to be continuous and can be persistent if the vein is not adequately secured during surgery.</li><li>\u2022 Torrential hemorrhage can be due to injury to an aberrantly large or aberrantly placed tonsillar arterial branch of the facial artery.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Tonsillar branch of the facial artery : The tonsils receive blood supply primarily from the tonsillar branch of the facial artery. Injury to this artery during tonsillar surgery can cause bleeding, but the bleeding is usually brisk and bright red, and the artery would likely be cauterized or ligated during surgery to prevent such bleeding.</li><li>\u2022 Option A.</li><li>\u2022 Tonsillar branch of the facial artery</li><li>\u2022 Option B . Ascending pharyngeal artery : It's a branch of the external carotid artery and supplies the pharynx, soft palate, and the tympanic cavity. While this artery does provide blood supply to the pharyngeal region, it's not as intimately associated with the tonsillar region as the tonsillar branch of the facial artery.</li><li>\u2022 Option B</li><li>\u2022 Ascending pharyngeal artery</li><li>\u2022 Option D . Retromandibular vein : The retromandibular vein is formed by the union of the superficial temporal vein and the maxillary vein in the parotid gland. It's located further away from the tonsillar region, and it's unlikely to be injured during procedures involving the tonsils.</li><li>\u2022 Option D</li><li>\u2022 Retromandibular vein</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Blood supply of the tonsils:</li><li>\u27a4 Blood supply of the tonsils:</li><li>\u27a4 Arterial supply:</li><li>\u27a4 Arterial supply:</li><li>\u27a4 The tonsillar branch of the facial artery is the main supply.

Hirschsprung's disease : This is a congenital disorder in which nerve cells (ganglion cells) are absent from a segment of the bowel, usually the rectum or sigmoid colon, leading to a functional obstruction. Infants with Hirschsprung's typically have difficulty with bowel movements within the first days of life. The symptoms can include constipation, abdominal distension, and vomiting. It is diagnosed often in the neonatal period with a barium enema and confirmed with suction rectal biopsy showing the absence of ganglion cells.</li><li>\u2022 A.</li><li>\u2022 Hirschsprung's disease</li><li>\u2022 B. Posterior urethral valve (PUV) : PUV is a congenital malformation in male child where an abnormality of the posterior urethra prevents urine outflow. This can lead to urinary obstruction, distension of the bladder, and can subsequently cause damage to the kidneys. Common symptoms include weak urine stream, difficulty in urination, recurrent urinary tract infections, and failure to thrive. Diagnosis is usually made with a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG).</li><li>\u2022 B.</li><li>\u2022 Posterior urethral valve (PUV)</li><li>\u2022 C. Choledochal cyst : This is a congenital dilation of the bile ducts, often causing obstruction. Patients may present with the classic triad of abdominal pain, jaundice, and an abdominal mass, although not all these signs may be evident. Over time, choledochal cysts can lead to complications like cholangitis, pancreatitis, or even malignancy. Diagnosis is typically done with imaging like ultrasound or MRCP, and definitive treatment is surgical removal.</li><li>\u2022 C.</li><li>\u2022 Choledochal cyst</li><li>\u2022 D. Intussusception : This is a medical condition in which a part of the intestine telescopes into another section, leading to bowel obstruction. It is the most common cause of bowel obstruction in children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years. Symptoms include sudden, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and \"currant jelly\" stools (due to mucus and blood). The diagnosis can often be made with an ultrasound or CT abdomen showing the characteristic \"target sign\" and is typically treated with high pressure enema, although some cases may require surgical intervention.</li><li>\u2022 D.</li><li>\u2022 Intussusception</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

It helps in visualizing the placental attachment and identifying abnormalities in placental implantation. Color Doppler ultrasonography is particularly useful to assess the blood flow and the vascularity of the placenta, which can indicate abnormal adherence. MRI (2) : MRI is used as a complementary imaging tool when ultrasonography results are inconclusive or to provide a more detailed view. It helps in evaluating the depth of placental invasion into the myometrium and can differentiate between placenta accreta, increta, and percreta. Angiography (3) : While angiography can provide information about blood vessels and may be used in some cases to evaluate blood flow abnormalities, it is not typically a primary diagnostic tool for placenta accreta. It may be used in specific scenarios or to plan surgical management, but it is not generally used for initial diagnosis. X-ray (4) : X-rays are not used in the diagnosis of placenta accreta due to their lack of sensitivity for soft tissue detail and the potential risk to the fetus.

B. 2</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The structure involved in causing lurching gait in the child is gluteus medius (marked as 2). The gluteus medius muscle is critical for stabilizing the pelvis during gait. When functioning normally, it prevents the pelvis from dropping to the opposite side during the swing phase of the walk. If injured or dysfunctional, such as might occur from a traumatic fall, the ability to maintain pelvic stability is compromised, leading to a lurching gait, known clinically as a Trendelenburg gait.</li><li>\u2022 The structure shown in the image are :</li><li>\u2022 The structure shown in the image are :</li><li>\u2022 1-Gluteus maximus</li><li>\u2022 2-Gluteus medius</li><li>\u2022 3-Piriformis</li><li>\u2022 4-Sciatic nerve</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 1.

Piriformis : A small muscle located deep in the buttock, behind the gluteus maximus. It helps with lateral rotation of the hip. Although it is near the sciatic nerve, it is less likely involved in producing a lurching gait unless it compresses the sciatic nerve, causing sciatica.</li><li>\u2022 3. Piriformis</li><li>\u2022 4. Sciatic Nerve : The largest nerve in the body, running from the lower back to the feet. While injury to this nerve can cause pain and weakness in the legs, it typically would not cause a lurching gait unless there is significant associated muscle weakness.</li><li>\u2022 4.

This is often demonstrated by a positive Trendelenburg sign and manifests as a compensatory lurch toward the affected side to maintain balance.</li><li>\u27a4 Additional Information</li><li>\u27a4 Additional Information</li><li>\u27a4 Gluteus medius and minimus are powerful abductors of the hip joint. Mechanism of actions of gluteus medius and minimus-</li><li>\u27a4 When the leg on one side is lifted off the ground, the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, on the opposite supported side, exert traction on the hip bone by acting from the femur. This action results in a slight raising of the pelvis on the unsupported side, which helps maintain the trunk in the upright position. The actions of these muscles are affected when there is an injury to the superior gluteal nerve, neck of the femur, or loss of normal angulation of the shaft of the femur. This occurs in conditions like paralysis of the glutei, developmental dysplasia of the hip, etc. When the gluteus medius and minimus are paralyzed, the pelvis sinks down on the unsupported (normal) side, when the patient tries to stand on the affected limb. This leads to a positive Trendelenburg's sign with a characteristic lurching gait - the patient lurches towards the affected side with contralateral pelvis drop.</li><li>\u27a4 When the leg on one side is lifted off the ground, the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, on the opposite supported side, exert traction on the hip bone by acting from the femur.
