They are used for the treatment of symptoms of the metabolic syndrome, mainly for lowering triglycerides and blood sugar. PPAR\u03b1 (alpha) is the main target of fibrate drugs, a class of amphipathic carboxylic acids (clofibrate, gemfibrozil, ciprofibrate, bezafibrate, and fenofibrate). Fibrates bind to PAR alpha and cause stimulation of lipoprotein lipase enzyme. Increased PL synthesis enhances the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Fibrates stimulate fatty acid oxidation and reduce the expression of apo C-III (inhibitor of lipolysis).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A.

They disrupt the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids by combining with bile constituents and preventing their reabsorption from the gut. In general, they are classified as hypolipidemic agents. Option C. Ezetimibe is a medicine used to treat high cholesterol. This medicine helps by reducing \"bad\" cholesterol (LDL). Lowering cholesterol levels reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke.

The defining characteristics of mania include increased talkativeness, rapid speech, a decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, distractibility, increase in goal-directed activity, and psychomotor agitation. The therapeutic range is 1.0 to 1.5 mEq/L for acute treatment and 0.6 to 1.2 mEq/L for chronic therapy. Monitoring should be done every 1 to 2 weeks until reaching the desired therapeutic levels. Then, check lithium levels every 2 to 3 months for six months. It is also important to monitor patients for dehydration and lower the dose when there are signs of infection, excessive sweating, or diarrhea. Toxic levels are when the drug level is more than 2 mEq/L.</p>\n<p></p>",
