HBOT has been used as an adjunctive therapy for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). It raises the oxygen in the inner ear by diffusion, activating cell metabolism and restoring the cochlea's ionic balance and electrophysiological functions.

It has also been used for the treatment of lingual thyroid. Radiofrequency (RF) cuts and coagulates tissues with minimal lateral tissue damage and charring. It is a minimally invasive technique, and surgery can be performed outdoors. Using different types of electrodes, radiofrequency has also been used to perform tonsillotomy, micro-laryngeal surgery (to remove granulomas, papillomas, cysts), myringotomy, uvulopalatoplasty, correction of rhinophyma and cosmetic removal of skin lesions. The radiofrequency (RF) device generates electromagnetic waves of very high frequency between 350 kHz and 4 MHz. Usually, 460 kHz is used.
