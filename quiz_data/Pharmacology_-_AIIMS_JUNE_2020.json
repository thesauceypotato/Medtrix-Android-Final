      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>12 hours after the last dose</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Lithium dose and serum concentrations \u2014 The starting dose of lithium is usually 300 mg two or three times daily. The total daily dose is then increased by 300 to 600 mg every one to five days based upon response, tolerability, and body mass index. The goal is to reach a therapeutic serum level, which generally occurs with a dose of 900 mg to 1800 mg per day. The half-life of lithium is approximately 24 hours. Thus, it takes at least four or five days for serum lithium concentrations to reach steady state after the dose is changed. Lithium can be dosed either once daily or in a divided dose regimen. Clinicians should start with a twice daily or three times daily dosing schedule to minimize side effects (especially nausea) early in treatment and consolidate the dose schedule to once daily after a number of weeks or months of treatment. The target serum level for acute phase management and maintenance treatment is between 0.8 and 1.2 mEq/L (0.8 and 1.2 mmol/L), and levels should usually not exceed 1.2 mEq/L (1.2 mmol/L) [39]. Patients who cannot tolerate a level of 0.8 mEq/L (0.8 mmol/L) may respond to a level of 0.6 mEq/L (0.6 mmol/L). After reaching the estimated therapeutic dose range (generally 900 mg to 1800 mg per day), the serum lithium concentration should be checked. Subsequently, a level should be measured five to seven days after each dose increase. In addition, if the dose is not changed and a level not checked for two or more weeks, a level should be checked before increasing the dose. An office-based instrument for fingerstick tests of lithium levels is available.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Lithium levels should be drawn approximately 12 hours after the last dose (12-hour serum trough level) and generally collected in the morning, before the first dose of the day. Changes in the serum level per unit time are not dramatic 12 hours after the last dose. Thus, a level drawn 11 to 13 hours after the last dose, or even 10 to 14 hours, provides meaningful information. In contrast, a serum level drawn a few hours after lithium ingestion is subject to marked fluctuation if the level is drawn one hour sooner or later, leading to unreliable information.</p>\n<p></p>",

Progestin also thickens the cervical mucus, thus hampering the transport of sperm. Withdrawal of the progestin stimulates menstrual bleeding during the placebo week. Oral contraceptives provide two hormones. The estrogens in birth control pills inhibit ovulation via the effect on the hypothalamus and the subsequent suppression of pituitary FSH and LH; inhibit implantation of the fertilized egg ; accelerate ovum transport; and cause luteolysis, or degeneration of the corpus luteum, thereby causing the fall of serum progesterone levels , which prevents normal implantation a nd placental attachment. The progestins in birth control pills create a thick cervical mucus that hampers the transport of sperm; inhibit capacitation required for sperm to penetrate the cells and macromolecular investments surrounding the ovum; inhibit implantation; and inhibit ovulation by a subtle disturbance in the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013ovarian functions and by modification of the MID cycle surge of FSH and LH.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Thioacetazone Isoniazid (Isonicotinic acid hydrazide, H) Isoniazid is an excellent antitubercular drug, and an essential component of all antitubercular regimens, unless the patient is not able to tolerate it or bacilli are resistant. It is primarily tuberculocidal . Fast multiplying organisms are rapidly killed, but quiescent ones are only inhibited. It acts on extracellular as well as on intracellular TB (bacilli present within macrophages), and is equally active in acidic or alkaline medium. It is one of the cheapest antitubercular drugs. However, most non tubercular mycobacteria are not inhibited by INH. The primary mechanism of action of INH is inhibition of synthesis of mycolic acids which are unique fatty acid components of mycobacterial cell wall. This may explain the high selectivity of INH for mycobacteria (it is not active against any other microorganism). Rifampin (Rifampicin, R) It is a semisynthetic derivative of rifamycin B obtained from Streptomyces mediterranei. Rifampin is bactericidal to M. tuberculosis and many other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria like Staph. Aureus, N. meningitidis, H. influenzae, E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus and Legionella. Against TB bacilli, it is as efficacious as INH and better than all other drugs. The bactericidal action covers all subpopulations of TB bacilli, but acts best on slowly or intermittently dividing ones (spurters). leprae is highly sensitive, while MAC and some other mycobacteria, but not M. fortuitum, are moderately susceptible. Both extra- and intracellular organisms are affected. It has good sterilizing and resistance preventing actions. Kanamycin (Km), Amikacin (Am) These are tuberculocidal aminoglycoside antibiotics, very similar in antitubercular activity, pharmacokinetic properties and types of adverse effects to S. Many S resistant and MDR strains of M. tuberculosis remain sensitive to them. One of these is mostly included in the regimen for MDR-TB during the intensive phase. Both Km and Am produce less vestibular toxicity than hearing loss, but are equally nephrotoxic. Patients should be instructed to report vertigo and tinnitus. Audiometry and monitoring of renal function is recommended. From the table: Kanamycin is bactericidal. Thiacetazone (Thz): Its efficacy in TB is now considered uncertain, and it is not indicated, even as a reserve drug, in MDR-TB. Alternative grouping of antitubercular drugs* Group I First line oral anti-TB drugs Isoniazid (INH), Rifampin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol Group II Injectable anti-TB drugs Streptomycin, Kanamycin, Amikacin, Capreomycin Group III Fluoroquinolones Ofloxacin, Levofloxacin, Moxifloxacin, Ciprofloxacin Group IV Second line oral anti-TB drugs Ethionamide, Prothionamide, Cycloserine, Terizidone, Para-aminosalicylic acid Group V Drugs with unclear efficacy\u00a3 Thiacetazone, Clarithromycin, Clofazimine, Linezolid, Amoxicillin/clavulanate, Imipenem/cilastatin * Adopted from: Treatment of Tuberculosis Guidelines; WHO, Fourth edition (2010) and Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), DOTS-Plus Guidelines 2010. \u00a3 Not recommended by WHO for routine use in MDR-TB patients. Group 1:    are the most potent and best tolerated oral drugs used routinely. Group II:    are potent and bactericidal, but injectable drugs. Group III: includes fluoroquinolones (FQs) which are well tolerated bactericidal oral drugs; all patients with drug resistant TB should receive one FQ. Group IV: are less effective, bacteriostatic/more toxic oral drugs for resistant TB. Group V: are drugs with uncertain efficacy; not recommended for MDR-TB; may be used in extensively resistant TB (XDR-TB).</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Vigabatrin It is an inhibitor of GABA- transaminase, the enzyme which degrades GABA. Anticonvulsant action may be due to increase in synaptic GABA concentration. It is effective in many patients with refractory epilepsy, especially CPS with or without generalization. It is approved only for adjuvant medication. Visual field contraction and production of behavioural changes, depression or psychosis has restricted its use to only as a reserve drug. Ethosuximide The most prominent action of ethosuximide is antagonism of PTZ induced clonic seizures at doses which produce no other discernable action. It raises seizure threshold but does not modify maximal electroshock seizures or inhibit kindling. Clinically it is effective only in absence seizures. Dose-related side effects are gastrointestinal intolerance, tiredness, mood changes, agitation, headache, drowsiness and inability to concentrate. Hypersensitivity reactions like rashes, DLE and blood dyscrasias are rare. No liver or kidney damage Phenobarbitone : The major drawback of phenobarbitone as an antiepileptic is its sedative action. Long term administration (as needed in epilepsy) may produce additional side effects like\u2014behavioral abnormalities, diminution of intelligence, impairment of learning and memory, hyperactivity in children, mental confusion in older people. Rashes, megaloblastic anaemia and osteomalacia (similar to that with phenytoin) occur in some patients on prolonged use. Levetiracetam : A unique anticonvulsant which suppresses kindled seizures, but is ineffective against maximal electroshock or PTZ. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated both as adjuvant medication as well as monotherapy in refractory partial seizures with or without generalization. The mechanism of action is not known. None of the major anticonvulsant mechanisms appear to be applicable. However, it may modify synaptic release of glutamate/GABA by binding to a specific synaptic protein labelled \u2018SV2A\u2019. This may or may not account for the antiepileptic property. Levetiracetam is completely absorbed orally, partly hydrolyzed, but mainly excreted unchanged in urine with a t\u00bd of 6\u20138 hours. It is neither oxidized by CYP enzymes nor induces or inhibits them. As such, it is free of drug interactions. Few side effects like sleepiness, dizziness, weakness and rarely behavioural changes are reported. Driving may be impaired. Because of good tolerability, levetiracetam is being increasingly used in CPS, GTCS and myoclonic epilepsy, mainly as add-on drug. It is not approved for use in children below 4 years.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is a specific antidote for fibrinolytic agents and has been used in many hyperplasminaemic states associated with excessive intravascular fibrinolysis resulting in bleeding. The primary indication is to counteract the effect of fibrinolytic drugs and bleeding due to their use. In hemophiliacs, it has adjunctive value for controlling bleeding due to tooth extraction, prostatectomy, trauma, etc. In haematuria it can cause ureteric obstruction by the unlysed clots. Therefore, fibrinolysis must be established firmly before using it. It can cause intravascular thrombosis. Rapid i.v. injection results in hypotension, bradycardia and may be arrhythmias. It should be used cautiously when renal function is impaired. Myopathy occurs rarely. The large dose needed is a limitation, and tranexamic acid is mostly preferred.</p>\n<p></p>",

As a result, rate of impulse generation is reduced\u2014bradycardia or even cardiac arrest may occur. At the A-V node and His-Purkinje fibres refractory period (RP) is increased and conduction is slowed: P-R interval increases and partial to complete A-V block may be produced . The force of atrial contraction is markedly reduced and RP of atrial fibres is abbreviated. Due to nonuniform vagal innervation, the intensity of effect on RP and conduction of different atrial fibres varies\u2014inducing inhomogeneity and predisposing to atrial fibrillation or flutter. Ventricular contractility is also decreased but the effect is not marked. The cardiac muscarinic receptors are of the M 2 subtype. Blood vessels: All blood vessels are dilated, though only few (skin of face, neck, salivary glands) receive cholinergic innervation. Fall in BP and flushing, especially in the blush area occurs. Muscarinic (M 3) receptors are present on vascular endothelial cells: vasodilatation is primarily mediated through the release of an endothelium dependent relaxing factor (EDRF) which is nitric oxide (NO). The PLc-IP 3 /DAG pathway activates endothelial NO synthase through the Ca + -Calmodulin mechanism. When the endothelium is damaged by disease, Ach can diffuse to the vascular smooth muscle and cause vasoconstriction via M 3 receptors located on their plasma membrane. Stimulation of cholinergic nerves to the penis causes erection by releasing NO and dilating cavernosal vessels through M 3 receptors. However, this response is minimal with injected cholinomimetic drugs. Smooth muscle: Smooth muscle in most organs is contracted (mainly through M 3 receptors). Tone and peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract is increased and sphincters relax \ud83e\udc6a abdominal cramps and evacuation of bowel. Peristalsis in ureter is increased.

For these patients who are at very high risk (eg, recurrent ischemic discomfort, dynamic ECG changes, or hemodynamic instability), consider adding a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (either eptifibatide or tirofiban). For patients managed with an invasive approach: Give ticagrelor loading dose of 180 mg at presentation. Prasugrel loading dose of 60 mg may be used as an alternative if given after diagnostic coronary angiography. For patients age 75 years or older, who weigh less than 60 kg, or with past stroke or TIA, ticagrelor or clopidogrel are preferred to prasugrel . Clopidogrel may be given in a dose of 300 to 600 mg, but we prefer 600 mg. For patients otherwise at high risk for bleeding due to prior hemorrhagic stroke, ongoing bleeding, bleeding diathesis, or clinically relevant anemia or thrombocytopenia, clopidogrel 300 to 600 mg is an option. For patients treated with an invasive approach and who receive bivalirudin, we do not recommend routinely giving a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor; for those patients treated with heparin and who are troponin-positive, we suggest adding a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (either abciximab or eptifibatide) given after diagnostic angiography. For those undergoing an invasive approach who are at very high risk (eg, recurrent ischemic discomfort, dynamic ECG changes, or hemodynamic instability), we consider adding a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor prior to diagnostic angiography (either eptifibatide or tirofiban) or after diagnostic angiography (abciximab or eptifibatide). Refer to text for dosing. Give anticoagulant therapy in all patients: For patients undergoing urgent catheterization (within four hours) or those managed with an early invasive strategy (angiography within 4 to 48 hours), we use either heparin or bivalirudin. We prefer initiation of heparin in the emergency department and a switch to bivalirudin in the catheterization laboratory. Dosing of UFH: IV bolus of 60 to 70 units/kg to a maximum of 5000 units, followed by an IV infusion of 12 units/kg per hour adjusted to achieve a goal aPTT of approximately 50 to 70 seconds (1.5 to 2 times control). Dose of bivalirudin: If bivalirudin is given in the emergency department, IV bolus of 0.1 mg/kg and an infusion of 0.25 mg/kg per hour before angiography. If PCI is performed, an additional 0.5 mg/kg bolus is given and the infusion rate is increased to 1.75 mg/kg per hour. For patients receiving a noninvasive approach, we recommend either fondaparinux or enoxaparin. Enoxaparin is an alternative to UFH for patients not undergoing an early invasive approach. No loading dose is necessary. Dosing is 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours. Dose adjustment for renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/minute)*: 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 24 hours.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Primidone A deoxy barbiturate, converted by liver to phenobarbitone and phenylethyl malonamide (PEMA). Its antiepileptic activity is mainly due to these active metabolites because t\u00bd of primidone (6\u201314 hr) is less than that of its active metabolites. About 1/3 primidone is excreted unchanged by kidney. Dose to dose primidone is less potent, but antiepileptic efficacy is similar to phenobarbitone. It is infrequently used now in GTCS and partial epilepsy, mainly as an adjuvant to phenytoin or carbamazepine. Adverse effects are similar to phenobarbitone. In addition, anaemia, leukopenia, psychotic reaction and lymph node enlargement occur rarely.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Active drug Active metabolite Chloral hydrate Morphine Cefotaxime Allopurinol Procainamide Primidone Diazepam Digitoxin Imipramine Amitriptyline Codeine Spironolactone Losartan Trichloroethanol Morphine-6-glucuronide Desacetyl cefotaxime Alloxanthine N \u2013 acetyl procainamide Phenobarbitone, phenylethylmalonamide Desmethyl-diazepam, oxazepam Digoxin Desipramine Nortriptyline Morphine Canrenone E 3174 Therefore, Primidone is itself an active drug and becomes more active through its metabolites.

It is the only azole with a fungicidal action due to its ability to cause direct fungal cell membrane damage. The available topical formulation of sertaconazole (2%) attains fungicidal concentration in the stratum corneum as the lipophilic property of the benzo thiophene ring enables prolonged dermal retention. This permits just once-daily application contrary to most other topical azoles. Sertaconazole has additional anti-inflammatory and antipruritic actions . It has shown efficacy even against dermatophyte isolates resistant to other azoles. Its faster and superior cure rates as compared to other azoles are well documented. The efficacy profile and dosage convenience of sertaconazole appear to be similar to that of terbinafine. However, few head-to-head comparisons have been done.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Tinnitus, severe diarrhea, ataxia SIDE EFFECTS The occurrence and severity of adverse reactions are generally directly related to serum lithium concentrations and to individual patient sensitivity to lithium. They generally occur more frequently and with greater severity at higher concentrations. Adverse reactions may be encountered at serum lithium concentrations below 1.5 mEq/L. Mild to moderate adverse reactions may occur at concentrations from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L, and moderate to severe reactions may be seen at concentrations from 2.0 mEq/L and above. Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and mild thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase and may persist throughout treatment. Transient and mild nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration. These side effects usually subside with continued treatment or with a temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. If persistent, a cessation of lithium therapy may be required. Diarrhea, vomiting, drowsiness, muscular weakness, and lack of coordination may be early signs of lithium intoxication, and can occur at lithium concentrations below 2.0 mEq/L . At higher concentrations, giddiness, ataxia , blurred vision, tinnitus , and a large output of dilute urine may be seen. Serum lithium concentrations above 3.0 mEq/L may produce a complex clinical Image involving multiple organs and organ systems. Serum lithium concentrations should not be permitted to exceed 2.0 mEq/L during the acute treatment phase. Therefore, the answer is C, Tinnitus, Diarrhoea and Ataxia</p>\n<p></p>",
