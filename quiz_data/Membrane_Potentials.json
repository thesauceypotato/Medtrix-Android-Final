Deriving the numerical value: EMF=61*log 100/10 =61*log10. =61*1 (since log 10 =1) =61mV Deciding the charge: The higher potassium concentration in the extracellular fluid means the potassium ions diffuse into the cell.

In patch-clamp mode, sufficient current must be administered to the cell in order to raise the voltage above the threshold voltage to start membrane depolarization. Depolarization is caused by a rapid rise in membrane potential opening of sodium channels in the cellular membrane, resulting in a large influx of sodium ions. Membrane Repolarization results from rapid sodium channel inactivation as well as a large efflux of potassium ions resulting from activated potassium channels.

An antidromic impulse in an axon refers to conduction opposite of the normal (orthodromic) direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>An axon can conduct in either direction. When an action potential is initiated in the middle of it, two impulses traveling in opposite directions are set up by electrotonic depolarization on either side of the initial current sink. In the natural situation, impulses pass in one direction only, i.e., from synaptic junctions or receptors along axons to their termination. Such conduction is called orthodromic. Conduction in the opposite direction is called antidromic. Because synapses, unlike axons, permit conduction in one direction only, an antidromic impulse will fail to pass the first synapse they encounter and die out at that point. The apparatus for protein synthesis in neurons are located primarily in the soma, with the transport of proteins and polypeptides to the axonal ending by the axoplasmic flow. Thus, the cell body maintains the functional and anatomic integrity of the axon. Orthograde transport occurs along microtubules located along the length of the axon; it requires two molecular motors, dynein, and kinesin. Orthograde transport moves from the cell body toward the axon terminals. It has both fast and slow components, fast axonal transport occurs at about 400 mm/day, and slow axonal transport occurs at 0.5\u201310 mm/day. Retrograde transport from the nerve ending to the cell body occurs at about 200 mm/day.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option B.
