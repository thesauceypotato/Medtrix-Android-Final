It should be used at the smallest effective dose and for the shortest duration. Young women with premature menopause clearly deserve HRT at least till the age of natural menopause. Hysterectomized women should receive estrogen alone, while those with intact uterus be given estrogen + progestin. The option of low-dose estrogen alone may be tried, if symptomatically effective. Perimenopausal women should be given cyclic HRT rather than continuous HRT. HRT is not the best option to prevent osteoporosis and fractures, but may be used in women <60 years of age. HRT affords protection against coronary artery disease only in early postmenopausal women. Combined HRT at conventional dose may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, MI and stroke in elderly women. HRT does not protect against cognitive decline; may increase the risk of dementia. Combined HRT increases the risk of breast cancer, gallstones and migraine. Transdermal HRT may have certain advantages over oral HRT. The need for HRT should be assessed in individual women, and not prescribed routinely.</p>\n<p></p>",

It should be used at the smallest effective dose and for the shortest duration. Young women with premature menopause clearly deserve HRT at least till the age of natural menopause. Hysterectomized women should receive estrogen alone, while those with intact uterus be given estrogen + progestin. The option of low-dose estrogen alone may be tried, if symptomatically effective. Perimenopausal women should be given cyclic HRT rather than continuous HRT. HRT is not the best option to prevent osteoporosis and fractures, but may be used in women <60 years of age. HRT affords protection against coronary artery disease only in early postmenopausal women. Combined HRT at conventional dose may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, MI and stroke in elderly women. HRT does not protect against cognitive decline; may increase the risk of dementia. Combined HRT increases the risk of breast cancer, gallstones and migraine. Transdermal HRT may have certain advantages over oral HRT. The need for HRT should be assessed in individual women, and not prescribed routinely.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Estrogen component of HRT can reverse hot flushes ( Option A ), vaginal atrophy & dryness ( Option B ), and osteoporosis ( Option C) .</p>\n<p></p>",

Blockade of estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus counteracts the estrogen-induced negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.

In response, the ovaries enlarge & ovulation occurs. Uses- For infertility due to failure of ovulation 50 mg once daily for 5 days starting from the 5th day of the cycle. To aid in vitro fertilization Oligozoospermia- 25 mg daily given for 24 days in a month with 6 days rest for up to 6 months has been recommended.

It has predominant estrogen antagonistic action in the uterus and breast with little action on the vaginal epithelium and cervical mucus.

For contraception- 30 mg twice a week for 12 weeks followed by once a week. Excessive bleeding attending anovulatory cycles is diminished & it is also approved for use in dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Side effects: Nausea, headache, fluid retention, weight gain, rise in BP & prolongation of menstrual cycles.

Tamoxifen- is a SERM that acts as a potent estrogen antagonist in breast carcinoma cells, and blood vessels & at some peripheral sites, but as a partial agonist in the uterus, bone, liver & pituitary. It is used in ER-positive breast cancer. Option: C. Toremifene is a newer congener of tamoxifen with similar actions, but is a weaker ER agonist. Uses & adverse effects are also similar. Option: D. Raloxifene is a SERM which is an estrogen partial agonist in bone, on lipid metabolism & CVS, but an antagonist in endometrium & breast . It prevents bone loss & increases bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women.
