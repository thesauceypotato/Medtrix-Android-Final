A) Intensity is inversely proportional to squared distance</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 This statement refers to the Inverse Square Law, which states that the intensity of radiation is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. This means that as the distance from the radiation source increases, the intensity of the radiation decreases exponentially. This law is fundamental in radiation physics and is crucial for understanding radiation exposure and protection.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Small blood vessels are most radioresistant: This is incorrect. Larger vessels are more radioresistant compared to smaller ones. The endothelial cells lining small vessels are more susceptible to radiation damage due to their relatively higher rate of proliferation.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Small blood vessels are most radioresistant:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Rapidly proliferating cells are most radioresistant: This is incorrect. Rapidly proliferating cells are the most radiosensitive. Cells that are dividing quickly, such as those in the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, and reproductive tissues, are more susceptible to radiation damage because radiation primarily affects DNA during cell division.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Rapidly proliferating cells are most radioresistant:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Small bowel is most radioresistant: This is incorrect. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including the small bowel, is among the most radiosensitive organ systems in the body. This high radiosensitivity is due to the rapid turnover of the epithelial cells lining the GI tract.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
