It can be induced by drugs such as nitrites, resulting in cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen therapy . Diagnosis is clinical, and treatment is with methylene blue to reduce methemoglobin back to functional hemoglobin.</li><li>\u27a4 methemoglobinemia</li><li>\u27a4 Fe3+</li><li>\u27a4 cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen therapy</li><li>\u27a4 methylene blue</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
