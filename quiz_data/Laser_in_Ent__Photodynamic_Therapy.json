A cancer patient in the ENT ward wants to understand more about this. All the following statements with respect to the treatment modality are true, except: It is based on injecting a photosensitising agent, which is taken up preferentially by the tumour cells and then exposing the site to a specific wavelength of the laser. Laser activates the photosensitising agent, which destroys cancer cells but spares the normal tissues. Photodynamic therapy has also been used for recurrences after surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. Laser often used in photodynamic therapy is an argon-tunable dye laser with a wavelength of 630 nm. Photosensitizing agents used intravenously include haematoporphyrin derivative (for head and neck cancers) and photosan-3 (for endobronchial tumours).",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>None of the above All the five options above are true . Therefore D (none of the above) is the answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Photodynamic Therapy: - It is an upcoming newer modality of treating skin cancer, larynx, nasopharynx, aerodigestive tract and endobronchial tumours. It is based on the principle of injecting a photosensitising agent, which is taken up preferentially by the tumour cells and then exposing the site to a specific wavelength of the laser. The laser activates the photosensitising agent, which destroys cancer cells but spares the normal tissues. Photodynamic therapy has also been used for recurrences after surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. Photosensitising agents used intravenously include haematoporphyrin derivative (for head and neck cancers) and photosan-3 (for endobronchial tumours). A topical sensitiser, delta-aminolevulinic acid, has been used for skin cancers (basal cell carcinoma and Bowen disease). An argon-tunable dye laser with a wavelength of 630 nm is often used in photodynamic therapy. It also has the advantage of delivery through flexible fibres. Also, lasers with different wavelengths can be produced by changing the dye. Patients receiving photodynamic therapy should avoid exposure to sunlight and use sun-protective clothing to avoid photosensitive skin reactions, which may continue for several weeks.</p>\n<p></p>",

No entry or exit of staff permitted. Protective glasses, specific for the laser's wavelength, should be worn by the surgeon, nurses and other OT personnel. Glasses should have side protectors. Wet saline pads are placed on the eyes. Use noninflammable gases such as enflurane. Oxygen concentration in inhaled gases should not exceed 40%. Halothane or enflurane are used as they are noninflammable. Nitrous oxide gas, being oxidising, is not used. Do not use N2O. Use a wavelength-specific endotracheal tube or wrap the tube with aluminium foil. Wet saline-soaked towels for the face or exposed parts of the skin.
