These may include infections of the urinary tract, bones, and joints, lungs (eg. pneumonia), brain, blood, among others. It is also used in hospitalized patients to prevent infections.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Amikacin is a commonly used aminoglycoside. Antimicrobial spectrum of aminoglycosides does not include Salmonella. It is used in gentamicin and tobramycin resistant infections. It is used for organisms like Pseudomonas, Proteus, and Serratia. It is also effective in MDR-TB. Ciprofloxacin is the drug of choice (in fluoroquinolone-susceptible infection). Fluoroquinolones are considered by many experts to be the drug of choice for susceptible isolates. Of the fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin are widely available and effective. Norfloxacin is very poorly absorbed and should not be used. If a fluoroquinolone cannot be used, alternatives include azithromycin and third generation cephalosporins. Fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible infection: When fluoroquinolones cannot be used, azithromycin can be used. If azithromycin cannot be used because of cost, availability, or other reasons, other options include third-generation cephalosporins and, if susceptibility is demonstrated, trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, or chloramphenicol. Azithromycin has good efficacy for enteric fever. In a systematic review that included seven randomized trials of adults and children with enteric fever, azithromycin was at least as effective as comparators (fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone). Among the third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone may be superior to cefotaxime. Oral cefixime has not been extensively compared directly with ceftriaxone but appears to be of generally comparable efficacy. Cefixime for 14 days was comparable to azithromycin given for 7 days (93 versus 87 percent cure) in a study of children with uncomplicated enteric fever. Ceftriaxone is the treatment of choice for hospitalized patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA CLASSIFICATION Systemic Aminoglycosides >Streptomycin >Gentamicin >Kanamycin >Tobramycin > Amikacin > Sisomicin > Netilmicin > Paromomycin Topical Aminoglycosides >Neomycin >Framycetin</p>\n<p></p>",

Metoclopramide crosses BBB and blocks central D2 receptors. The major side effects of metoclopramide include EPS, such as those seen with the phenothiazine anti-psychotics. Dystonia usually occur acutely after intravenous administration and parkinsonian-like symptoms may occur several weeks after initiation of therapy. They generally respond to treatment with anticholinergic or antihistaminic drugs and are reversible upon discontinuation of metoclopramide. Tardive dyskinesia also can occur with chronic treatment (months to years) and may be irreversible. EPS appear to occur more commonly in children and young adults and at higher doses. Like other DA antagonists, metoclopramide also can cause galactorrhea by blocking the inhibitory effect of dopamine on prolactin release. Domperidone also blocks D2 receptors but it does not cross BBB, hence devoid of EPS. Ondansetron is a substance P antagonist used for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. It does not block D2 receptors. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid, used as an adjuvant for chemotherapy induced vomiting.

Heparin is a sulfated polysaccharide with a molecular weight range of 3000 to 30,000 Da (mean, 15,000 Da). It produces its major anticoagulant effect by inactivating thrombin and activated factor X (factor Xa) through an AT-III -dependent mechanism. Heparin binds to AT-III through a high-affinity Penta saccharide, which is present on about a third of heparin molecules. For inhibition of thrombin, heparin must bind to both the coagulation enzyme and AT (scaffolding of thrombin molecule is required by the heparin), whereas binding to the enzyme is not required for inhibition of factor Xa (only conformational change is sufficient). Molecules of heparin with fewer than 18 saccharides lack the chain length to bridge between thrombin and AT and therefore are unable to inhibit thrombin.</p>\n<p></p>",

When the time to reach steady state is long, as it is for drugs with long half-lives and having high volume of distribution (Vd) due to their tissue affinities, it may be desirable to administer a large dose (loading dose) to achieve the desired plasma levels rapidly. The volume of distribution is \u2018the proportionality factor that relates the total amount of drug in the body to the concentration in the plasma (Cp). Loading dose = Vd \u00d7 Desired steady state plasma concentration Loading dose can be given as single dose or multiple doses over a short time. E.g. in case of treatment of AF by digoxin (longer acting drug with high Vd), loading dose is must to saturate the tissues and to achieve desired plasma concentration rapidly (otherwise it would take about a week for digoxin to achieve the steady state plasma concentration). Loading dose of Chloroquine is also required to treat the malaria. On the other hand, maintenance dose is dependent of the clearance (Cl) as we have to maintain the steady state concentration in view of the volume of the plasma cleared of drug per unit time.

It may be contaminated or contain the wrong or no active ingredient. They could have the right active ingredient but at the wrong dose. Counterfeit drugs are illegal and may be harmful to your health. In our question, the drug company labeled that the drug contains 500 mg of paracetamol but on analysis it contained only 200 mg of drug. Going with this definition, it has the right ingredient (paracetamol) but at a wrong dose (200 mg in place of 500 mg). Hence, this is a case of counterfeit medicine. WHO Definition: A counterfeit medicine is one which is deliberately and fraudulently mislabelled with respect to identity and/or source. Counterfeiting can apply to both branded and generic products and counterfeit products and may include products with the correct ingredients, wrong ingredients, without active ingredients, with insufficient quantity of active ingredients or with Jake packaging. Since drug in our question, i.e., paracetamol contains insufficient quantity (200 mg instead of 500 mg), again this qualifies for a counterfeit drug. Spurious/adulterated drugs: According to the CDSCO (drugs and cosmetic act 1940, rules 1945, amendment 5th December 2008) Spurious or imitation drug products are drug formulations manufactured concealing the true identity of the product and made to resemble another drug, especially some popular brand, to deceive the buyer and cash on the popularity of original product. The product may or may not contain the active ingredients. Spurious drugs are usually manufactured by unlicensed anti-social elements, but sometimes licensed manufacturers may also be involved. The adulterated drugs are those drugs which are found to contain an adulterant/substituted product or contaminated with filth rendering it injurious to health. In India, the penalty for manufacture of spurious or adulterated drugs has been enhanced to an imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 10 years, but which may extend to imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to fine which shall not be less than ten lakh rupees or three times value of the drug confiscated, whichever is more. In certain cases, offences have been made cognizable and non-bailable.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA The Counterfeit Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Many counterfeit and substandard drugs are produced overseas, often in Southeast Asia, China, India, Nigeria, Russia, Mexico, Brazil and Latin America. Growing ancedotal evidence suggests that many substandard and \"gray\" pharmaceuticals are being produced in Western industrialized countries. Both licit and illicit products are funneled into the legitimate supply chain through freight forwarders, shipping companies, importers, diverters, tertiary and secondary wholesalers, and individual and online purchasers. Products may end up on the shelves of local pharmacies and legitimate online retailers, or may be marketed directly to consumers via phony internet pharmacies or through personal black markets. Patients may either unknowingly purchase counterfeit drugs from a legitimate retailer, or knowingly purchase illicit products at cut rate prices through the black market.</p>\n<p></p>",

This question also demands such an activity. So here we go venous thromboembolism (VTE) management in cancer patients requires a complicated balance between high recurrence risk and concerns for significant hemorrhagic complications. Additionally, patients with cancer frequently have comorbid conditions (e.g., renal failure, thrombocytopenia) or use of medications that interact with and limit the safe use of many anticoagulant medications. These patients also require frequent interruptions in therapy for invasive procedures, dietary changes affecting vitamin K intake, and potential intolerance for oral administration due to GI adverse effects associated with chemotherapy. Current guideline-endorsed therapy options for cancer-associated thrombosis include low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), warfarin, and fondaparinux. These include the American College of Chest Physician (ACCP), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). Based largely on the CLOT (Comparison of Low Molecular Weight Heparin Versus Oral Anticoagulant Therapy for Long Term Anticoagulation in Cancer Patients with Venous Thromboembolism) and CATCH trials, all current guidelines recommend LMWH for at least 3\u20136 months in cancer-associated VTE, with the potential to treat indefinitely in patients with active malignancy and ongoing treatment. UFH can be considered for patients with renal insufficiency, and fondaparinux can be considered for patients with heparin- induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The landmark CLOT trial demonstrated that. LMWH was more effective that warfarin at reducing the risk of recurrent VTE in patients with DVT/PE and active cancer.

It facilitates the movement of potassium ions through lipid membranes \u201cdown\u201d the electrochemical potential gradient. A very little literature is available regarding valinomycin.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hypoglycemia</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Salbutamol is a selective short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) used for bronchial asthma. Beta 2 receptor stimulation in response to hypoglycemia is, 4-helpful, as it causes glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen into glucose) by stimulating the hepatic phosphorylase enzyme. This is protective response of the body in response to hypoglycemia. Hence, Beta-2 agonists cannot cause hypoglycemia. Both beta-1 and beta-2 receptor activation produces warning signs of the hypoglycemia (tachycardia/palpitations, anxiety, sweating, tremors, etc.). These warning signs will be suppressed if beta blockers (particularly nonselective) are given to such patients which will also lead to delayed recovery from hypoglycemia (beta-2 induced glycogenolysis will also be inhibited). Tremors occur because beta-2 agonists directly stimulate beta-2 receptors present in the skeletal muscles. Beta-2 agonists have insulin-like action on potassium. They push potassium into the cells leading to hypokalemia. Insulin and beta-2 agonists are useful in the treatment of hyperkalemia. Beta-2 agonists on repeated use and on higher doses lose selectivity and they can activate beta-1 receptors (cardiac). This can manifest as tachycardia.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Salbutamol adverse effects glucose & insulin \u2191 BSL liver muscle B\u2082 glycogenolysis, hyperinsulinaemia Potassium \u2193 K* Na/K-ATPase intracellular shift lactate \u2191 lactic acidosis anaerobic glycolysis in muscle, increased vent demand cardiovascular \u2193 BP \u2191 HR vasodilation skeletal muscle beds + reflex tachycardia, vasodilation pulmonary bed uncouples VQ match tachycardia cardiac \u1e9e\u2081, direct inotrope, prolongs QT c interval, cardiac \u1e9e\u2082 exacerbated by low \u1e9e + low Mg increases minute ventilation (does not x BBB) metabolic rate \u2191 oxygen consumption \u2191 CO 2 production tolerance (reduced \u1e9e receptor sensitivity)</p>\n<p></p>",

Rest all-drugs, i.e., vancomycin (given orally only for one condition, i.e., antibiotic-associated diarrhea), ceftriaxone and streptomycin are used by parenteral route. We require OPO based treatment; hence Azithromycin is the best answer here.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>For community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients who do not require hospitalization, have no major comorbidities, have not used antibiotics within the last three months, and reside in a region in which there is not a high prevalence of macrolide-resistant, Azithromycin (500 mg on day I followed by four days of 250 mg a day or 500 mg daily for three days) is the preferred drug. Now coming to our question, we can assume that there is no need of hospitalization and there is no data on macrolide resistance. Again, this points towards the role of azithromycin in the above patient. Doxycycline is another option, but macrolides are preferred over doxycycline because there are more data demonstrating the efficacy of macrolides for uncomplicated CAP. Fluoroquinolones and cefuroxime (also doxycycline) are the alternatives in case of macrolide resistance. Vancomycin can be used in case of MRSA infections. Streptomycin is not a preferred agent.</p>\n<p></p>",

It does not act on CCR-5 receptors. Maraviroc is a chemokine receptor 5 (CCR-5) antagonist. It also prevents the entry of HIV-l into the host cells. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor (PI) (not nucleoside, reverse transcriptase inhibitor). It is usually given with lopinavir and other PIs to boost their levels (as it inhibits CY3A4 and increases the levels of other PIs). It is also known as pharmacological booster. Dolutegravir is the integrase strand transfer inhibitor, acts by inhibiting the integrase viral enzyme, thereby, preventing the insertion/integration of HIV pro-viral DNA into the host cell genome. It has more activity against HIV strains resistant to other integrase inhibitors like raltegravir and elvitegravir. This is correctly matched in this question and it is the answer.</p>\n<p></p>",
