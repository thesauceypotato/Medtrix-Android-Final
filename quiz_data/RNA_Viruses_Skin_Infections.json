      "text": "A 24-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 0, at 26 weeks gestation comes to the emergency department due to abdominal cramping and vaginal bleeding. She recently emigrated from Bolivia and reports no prior medical problems. The patient's only medication is a daily multivitamin. Immunization status is unknown. The patient spontaneously delivers a stillborn fetus with multiple congenital malformations. Fetal autopsy reveals microcephaly with thin cerebral cortices, ventriculomegaly, and subcortical calcifications. Viral RNA of a neurotropic virus is detected in the body fluids of the mother and the fetus. Transplacental transmission of this virus causes apoptosis of neural progenitor cells in the developing fetus, leading to disruption of neuronal proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Which of the following viruses most likely caused this patient's in-utero infection?",

Fetal brain development is impaired due to the disruption of normal proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neurons. Classic findings in affected newborns include microcephaly with facial features out of proportion to head size, arthrogryposis (contractures), seizures, hypertonia, and ocular abnormalities. Loss of brain mass (eg, cortical thinning, ventriculomegaly), as well as subcortical calcifications, are typically present. Diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of Zika RNA (real-time reverse transcriptase PCR) in serum, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid. The mainstay of treatment for surviving infants is supportive care with management of feeding difficulties, hydrocephalus, and seizures.

Rhinoviruses may also cause sore throats, ear infections, and infections of the sinuses (openings in the bone near the nose and eyes). T hey may also cause pneumonia and bronchiolitis, but this is less common. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to identify the most important serotypes that have to be covered by a possible vaccine.

There are continual rounds of viral replication and cell killing in each patient, and the steady-state level of the virus in the blood varies with the individual.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options A, B, and C.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>p24 antigen assay The patient would likely be in the window period (serology negative) . Hence best investigation would be the p24 antigen assay. Testing for antibodies needs to be done only after 2 to 6 months to ascertain whether the infection has occurred or not after a single sexual exposure.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. The most common HIV tests use blood to detect HIV infection. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests a patient's blood sample for antibodies. Option C. The Western blot test separates the blood proteins and detects the specific proteins (HIV antibodies) that indicate an HIV infection. The Western blot is used to confirm a positive ELISA, and the combined tests are 99.9% accurate. Option D. A lymph node biopsy can confirm a diagnosis of AIDS-related lymphoma and identify the type. So, Options C, B, and D. Are different from the correct options.</p>\n<p></p>",
