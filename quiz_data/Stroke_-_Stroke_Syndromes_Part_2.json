      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Watershed between ACA and MCA Right ICA supplies blood to both the right ACA and MCA . Decreased blood supply to both ACA and MCA would most severely damage the tissue that lies between the distribution of 2 arteries. This area is known as a watershed area. The watershed territory between the MCA and ACA corresponds to the shoulder and hip girdle muscles on the motor homunculus, leading to a characteristic clinical deficit, and weakness of the shoulder and hip girdle muscles bilaterally.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Anterior cerebral artery occlusion- The ACA is divided into two segments: precommunal (A1) circle of Willis, or stem, which connects the internal carotid artery to the anterior communicating artery- gives rise to several deep penetrating branches that supply the anterior limb of the internal capsule, the anterior perforated substance, amygdala, the anterior hypothalamus, and the inferior part of the head of the caudate nucleus. Occlusion of the proximal ACA is usually well tolerated because of collateral flow through the anterior communicating artery and collaterals through the MCA and PCA. postcommunal (A2) segment distal to the anterior communicating artery - A2 segment lesion C/L weakness- head and foot C/L sensory loss-head and foot Gait Apraxia Abulia- delayed verbal and motor response C/L grasp and suctioning reflex present Sensory -motor area of paracentral lobule damage- Urinary incontinence.
