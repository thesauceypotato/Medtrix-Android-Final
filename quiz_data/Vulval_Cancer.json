In theory, the presence or absence of metastatic disease in the sentinel node should reflect the status of the nodal basin as a whole. Thus a negative sentinel lymph nod e would allow the omission of lymphadenectomy of the whole nodal basin. It is detected through perilesional injection of radiolabeled technetium-9 9 or blue dye followed by intraoperative identification of the sentinel lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node detection has become an integral part of the management strategy for breast cancer and melanoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options A, B, and D: sentinel LN biopsy is not effective. Treatment of Vulval Cancer Stage IA or invasion <1 mm Wide local excision /simple partial vulvectomy , no need for lymphadenectomy. In a simple partial vulvectomy, dissection is carried until the superficial layer of the urogenital fascia. Stage IB and II - Radical vulvectomy/Modified radical vulvectomy with thorough inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. In modified radical/radical vulvectomy - dissection is done until the deep fascia of the urogenital diaphragm , i.e. the perineal membrane. If the lesion is central do B/L lymph node dissection otherwise if it is >2 cm from midline do ipsilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. Postoperative radiotherapy is to be given if 2 or more groin nodes are involved or the disease-free margin is <8 cm Stage III-. Megavoltage radiotherapy 4000-5000 rad Over a period of 5 weeks causes shrinkage. Local excision of the shrunken tumor is then adequate and eliminates the need for an exenteration operation Stage IV . It is treated by chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Anal involvement is satisfactorily treated with infusion of 5-FU and mitomycin C, followed by radiotherapy 3000 rad over 3 weeks. Local excision of the residual tumor may be required. Chemotherapy avoids exenteration operations with its associated high mortality and morbidity. Other chemotherapy agents used are as follows: Bleomycin Methotrexate Trastuzumab This regime is administered weekly for 6 weeks</p>\n<p></p>",

The lesion is pigmented and presents as either nodular or superficial spreading tumour. The edges of the lesion are often irregular and frequently ulcerate and bleed. Treatment : Radical vulvectomy and bilateral regional lymphadenectomy (en-block) is the preferred treatment. Pelvic lymphadenectomy does not alter the prognosis. Radiation therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or immunotherapy are ineffective. Overall prognosis is poor.</p>\n<p></p>",
