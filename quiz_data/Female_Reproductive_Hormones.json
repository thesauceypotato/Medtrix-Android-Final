      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Progesterone Progesterone is mainly responsible for the maintenance of endometrial thickness in the post-ovulatory phase.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The menstrual cycle consists of three phases: the menstrual phase, the proliferative phase, and the secretory, or progestational phase. Menstrual phase: This phase is characterized by the discharge of blood and endometrial debris from the vagina. It coincides with the end of the ovarian luteal phase and the onset of a new follicular phase. Withdrawal of progesterone on the degeneration of the corpus luteum (CL) leads simultaneously to sloughing of the endometrium (menstruation) and the development of new follicles in the ovary under the influence of rising gonadotropic hormone levels. Proliferative Phase: Thus, menstrual flow ceases, and the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle begins concurrently with the last portion of the ovarian follicular phase. When the menstrual flow ceases, a thin endometrial layer less than 1 mm thick remains. Estrogen stimulates the proliferation of epithelial cells, glands, and blood vessels in the endometrium, increasing this lining to a thickness of 3 to 5 mm. The estrogen-dominant proliferative phase lasts from the end of menstruation to ovulation. Peak estrogen levels trigger the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge responsible for ovulation. Secretory or Progestational Phase: After ovulation, when a new corpus luteum is formed, the uterus enters the secretory, or progestational, phase, which coincides in time with the ovarian luteal phase. The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of progesterone and estrogen. Progesterone converts the thickened, estrogen-primed endometrium to a richly vascularized, glycogen-filled tissue. This period is called either the secretory phase because the endometrial glands are actively secreting glycogen into the uterine lumen for early nourishment of a developing embryo before it implants, or the progestational (\"before pregnancy\") phase, referring to the development of a lush endometrial lining capable of supporting an early embryo after implantation. If fertilization and implantation do not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates and a new follicular phase and menstrual phase begin again.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Rest all options are explained in the Highyield section</p>\n<p></p>",
