Its outer one-third is cartilaginous while inner two-third are bony. Hair follicles, sebaceous and ceruminous glands are confined only to its outer one-third. Boil, a staphylococcal infection of the hair follicle, therefore occurs only in the outer part of the canal. Floor of the cartilage forming the outer cartilaginous canal may show dehiscences called fissures of Santorini, which permit infections of the parotid or from the mastoid to present in the canal and vice versa.</p>\n<p></p>",
