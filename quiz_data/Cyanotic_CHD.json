      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection Patient presents with cyanosis and signs of heart failure which gives clue to a cyanotic heart disease in failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Chest Xray shows characteristic \u201csnowman of figure of 8\u201d appearance which is seen only after 2 years of age. Supracardiac TAPVC has the best prognosis and Infracardiac TAPVC has the worst prognosis because of more Severe obstruction.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Tetralogy of Fallot: It is a cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary stenosis, a misplaced aorta and right ventricular hypertrophy. Chest Xray shows upturned apex giving it an appearance of boot shaped heart. Option: B. Ebstein anomaly is a rare cyanotic CHD characterised by displacement of septal and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve towards the apex of the right ventricle of the heart leading to atrialization of the right ventricle. Chest Xray shows box shaped heart (cardiac enlargement due to right atrial and right ventricular enlargement). Option: C. Transposition of great vessels: It shows cardiomegaly with narrow base, narrow mediastinum and plethoric lung fields. Narrow mediastinum is due overlapping of aorta and pulmonary artery when seen in AP/PA This gives characteristic \u201cEgg-on-side or Egg-on-string\u201d appearance.</p>\n<p></p>",
