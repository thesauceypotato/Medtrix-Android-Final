The cause of fibrosis is not known, but it is possibly a result of ischaemic necrosis of the sterno-mastoid muscle at birth. Evidence in favor of this theory is the presence of a lump in the sterno-mastoid muscle in the first few weeks of life, probably a swollen ischaemic muscle. This is termed sterno-mastoid tumour. The lump disappears spontaneously within a few months, leaving a fibrosed muscle. Torticol- lis occurs more commonly in children with breech presentation. Diagnosis: The child usually presents at 3-4 years of age, often as late as puberty. The head is tilted to one side so that the chin faces to the opposite side (Fig-39.1). The sterno-mastoid is prominent on the side the head tilts, and becomes more prominent on trying to passively correct the head tilt. In cases presenting in the first few weeks of life, a lump may be felt in the sterno-mastoid muscle. Facial asymmetry develops in cases who present later in life. Radiological examination is normal, and is carried out to rule out an underlying bone defect such as scoliosis. Treatment : In a child presenting with a sterno- mastoid tumour, progress to torticollis can be prevented by passive stretching and splinting. The same may also be sufficient for mild deformities in</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B.
