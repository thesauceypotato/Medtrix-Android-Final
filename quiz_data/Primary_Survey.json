BREATHING ( VENTILATION AND OXYGENATION ): Assess breathing, Rate and depth Percuss chest Auscultate chest Administer oxygen Attach pulse oximeter for monitoring the spo2 of the patient. If abnormal breathing is detected, management: Ventilate the patient if required. Alleviate tension pneumothorax Seal open pneumothorax. CIRCULATION WITH HEMORRHAGIC CONTROL: Assess circulation, Identify external haemorrhage Pulse BP Skin colour Identify potential internal haemorrhage. If the abnormality is detected: Apply direct pressure over the external bleeding point. Insert 2 large bore iv canula. Simultaneously obtain blood for blood transfusion and cross match Initiate iv fluids. Consider the potential need for operative management. DISABILITY: Assess consciousness Use GCS score. Assess pupils Size/ equality/ reaction. EXPOSURE / ENVIRONMENT: Completely undress the patient but prevent hypothermia. Anterior and posterior nasal packing should be done to prevent nasal bleeding. Resuscitation of patients with hypovolemic shock begins by making the airway secure by ensuring proper ventilation and oxygen therapy. External bleeding is done by the application of pressure and surgical control. Immediately life-threatening pulmonary injuries should be early detected and treated as soon as possible. Large bore iv cannula to prevent hypovolemic shock The chest X-ray is of utmost importance in cases with pulmonary injuries. Trauma resuscitation (1:1:1) packed cells, plasma, and platelets are used in this ratio. Because most patients do not require more than 6 units of PRBCs, most do not receive FFP. For patients who require more units of PRBCs, 7-12 units of PRBCs should be administered along with 6 units of FFP and 1 unit of apheresis platelets. Preferably, FFP and platelets should be transfused first, before the next 6 units of PRBCs are transfused.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) system delineates an order of priorities defned by ABCD; that is, airway, breathing, circulation and disability (neurology).

Mechanism of blunt hepatic trauma: compression with direct parenchymal damage and shearing forces. which tear hepatic tissue and disrupt vascular and ligamentous attachments. Most liver injuries involve segments 6,7 and 8. Mostly the bleeding seen in hepatic injuries is venous, and therefore low pressure, tamponade is readily performed.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Liver Trauma: Liver injury due to blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma is second in frequency only to that of the spleen. Blunt injury produces contusion, laceration and avulsion, often associated with splenic, mesenteric or renal injuries. (Common & has high Mortality) Penetrating injuries , including stab and gunshot wounds , are often associated with chest or pericardial involvement. Complications: Intrahepatic haematoma Liver abscess Bile collection Biliary fistula Haemobilia Ascites Biliary strictures Intra-abdominal collections Hepatic artery aneurysm Arteriovenous fistula Arterio Biliary fistula Liver failure Diagnosis: The liver is an extremely well-vascularised organ and blood loss is the major early complication following injury A high index of suspicion is essential with any chest or upper abdominal stab wound, especially where significant blood loss is obvious . Severe crushing injuries to the lower chest or upper abdomen frequently result in rib fractures, haemothorax and splenic and/or liver injury. Penetrating injuries are frequently associated with massive, continued blood loss and coagulopathies ; transfer to the operating theatre should occur while blood products are obtained and resuscitation continues. Focused assessment sonography in trauma (FAST) performed by an experienced operator will identify free intraperitoneal fluid. In haemodynamically unstable patients with penetrating wounds, a laparotomy and/or thoracotomy is indicated once active resuscitation has commenced In haemodynamically stable patients , an urgent contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest and abdomen is performed to look for parenchymal injury and concomitant damage to other thoracic or abdominal organs</p>\n<p></p>",

With insufficient delivery of oxygen and glucose, cells switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. If perfusion is not restored in a timely fashion, cell death ensues . Classification Of Shock: Hemorrhagic/hypovolemic shock (due to reduced circulating volume) Causes: Non-Haemorrhagic Poor fluid intake (dehydration), Excessive fluid loss due to vomiting, Diarrhoea, urinary loss (e.g. diabetes), Evaporation or \u2018third spacing\u2019, where fluid is lost into the gastrointestinal tract and interstitial spaces , for example in a bowel obstruction or pancreatitis. Haemorrhagic Types: Revealed Haemorrhage (External Haemorrhage) Eg. exsanguination from an open arterial wound Concealed Haemorrhage (Within the Body Cavity) Eg. occult gastrointestinal bleeding A primary haemorrhage is a haemorrhage occurring immediately as a result of an injury (or surgery) . Reactionary haemorrhage is delayed haemorrhage (within 24 hours) and is usually due to the dislodgement of a clot by resuscitation, normalisation of blood pressure and vasodilatation. Reactionary haemorrhage may also be due to technical failures, such as slippage of a ligature. Secondary haemorrhage is due to sloughing of the wall of a vessel. It usually occurs 7\u201314 days after injury and is precipitated by factors such as infection, pressure necrosis (such as from a drain) or malignancy. Classification: Traditional classification of haemorrhagic shock Class 1 2 3 4 Blood volume lost as percentage of total <15% 15-30 30-40% 40% Haemorrhage Resuscitation Identify Haemorrhage Damage Control Resuscitation Principles rapid haemorrhage control permissive hypotension avoiding dilutional coagulopathy treating existing coagulation deficits</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Definitive control of haemorrhage and restoration of adequate circulating volume are the goals of treating haemorrhagic shock. We should maintain the vitals of the patient. Option: C. Any injured patient who is cool to touch and is tachycardic should be considered to be in shock. Option: D. Massive blood loss may produce only a slight decrease in initial haematocrit or haemoglobin concentration.</p>\n<p></p>",

Warm intravenous fluids before infusing them, and maintain a warm environment. Hypothermia can be present when the patient arrives, or it may develop quickly in the emergency room if the patient is uncovered and undergoes rapid administration of room-temperature fluids or refrigerated blood.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Chest decompression with tube insertion Airway patency alone does not ensure adequate ventilation. Adequate gas exchange is required to maximize oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination. Ventilation requires the adequate function of the lungs, chest wall, and diaphragm; therefore, clinicians must rapidly examine and evaluate each component. Injuries that significantly impair ventilation in the short term include tension pneumothorax, massive haemothorax, open pneumothorax, and tracheal or bronchial injuries. These injuries should be identified during the primary survey and often require immediate attention to ensure effective ventilation. Because a tension pneumothorax compromises ventilation and circulation dramatically and acutely, chest decompression should follow immediately when suspected by clinical evaluation. Simple pneumothorax, simple haemothorax, fractured ribs, flail chest, and pulmonary contusion can compromise ventilation to a lesser degree and are usually identified during the secondary survey. A simple pneumothorax can be converted to a tension pneumothorax when a patient is intubated and positive pressure ventilation is provided before decompressing the pneumothorax with a chest tube Whereas Tension pneumothorax can be associated with hemodynamic imbalance.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Pnuemothorax: Pneumothorax is the presence of air outside the lung, within the pleural space Types: Spontaneous Primary (Common among young men) It is due to leaks from small blebs, vesicles or bullae, which may become pedunculated, typically at the apex of the upper lobe or on the upper border of the lower or middle lobes. Secondary This occurs when the visceral pleura leaks as part of underlying lung disease; any disease that involves the pleura may cause pneumothorax, including tuberculosis, any cavitating lung disease and necrosing tumour Tension pneumothorax : When (independent of aetiology) there is a build-up of positive pressure within the hemithorax, to the extent that the lung is completely collapsed, the diaphragm is fattened, the mediastinum is distorted and, eventually, the venous return to the heart is compromised.

At least four people are needed for logrolling a patient to remove a spine board and/or examine the back.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The log roll manoeuvre is performed to evaluate the patient\u2019s spine and remove the long spine board while limiting spinal movement. One person stands at the patient\u2019s head to control the head and c-spine, and two are along the patient\u2019s sides to control the body and extremities. As the patient is rolled, three people maintain alignment of the spine while the fourth person removes the board and examines the back. Once the board is removed, three people return the patient to the supine position while maintaining the alignment of the spine. Per rectum, the examination is also performed during this time only In case 5 people are not available then, a total of 4 persons are mandatory .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option B : Removing a helmet properly is a two-person procedur e. While one person restricts the movement of the cervical spine, the second person expands the helmet laterally. The second person then removes the helmet, while ensuring that the helmet clears the nose and occiput. After the helmet is removed, the first person supports the weight of the patient\u2019s head and the second person takes over the restriction of cervical spine motion. Option C : In patients who have a decreased level of consciousness, the tongue can fall backwards and obstruct the hypopharynx. To readily correct this form of obstruction, healthcare providers use chin-lift or jaw-thrust manoeuvers. Manoeuvers used to establish an airway can produce or aggravate the c-spine injury, so restriction of cervical spinal motion by other personnel is mandatory during these procedures . Management of the cervical spine is the most important step after trauma. Chin lift manoeuvre : The chin-lift manoeuvre is performed by placing the fingers of one hand under the mandible and then gently lifting it upward to bring the chin anterior. With the thumb of the same hand, lightly depress the lower lip to open the mouth. The thumb also may be placed behind the lower incisors while simultaneously lifting the chin gently. Do not hyperextend the neck while employing the chin-lift manoeuvre. Jaw Thrust manoeuvre : To perform a jaw thrust manoeuvre, grasp the angles of the mandibles with a hand on each side and then displace the mandible forward. When used with the facemask of a bag-mask device, this manoeuvre can result in a good seal and adequate ventilation. As in the chin-lift manoeuver, be careful not to extend the patient\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>If patients need to be moved during their primary survey, such as when moving onto the CT scanning gantry, a 20\u00b0 roll with inline spinal stabilisation should be used Modern \u2018scoop stretchers\u2019 mean that there is no requirement to roll any patient more than 20\u00b0 until a pelvic fracture has been excluded</p>\n<p></p>",
