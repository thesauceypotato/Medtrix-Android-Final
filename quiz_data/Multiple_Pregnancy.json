In dichorionic twins there is a thick septum between the chorionic sacs. It is best identified at the base of the membrane, where a triangular projection is seen. This is known as lambda or twin peak sign.

Option C: Thick membrane is present in monochorionic twins This is also incorrect because monochorionic means there is a single chorion whereas dichorionic means there are 2 chorions so obviously dichorionic membrane will be thick . Option D: Chronicity is best detected after 16 weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Monochorionic pregnancies have a dividing membrane that is so thin, it may not be seen until the second trimester. The membrane is generally less than 2mm thick and magnification reveals only 2 layers (of amnion) The best time to detect chrorionicity by USG is between 6 to 9 weeks.</p>\n<p></p>",
