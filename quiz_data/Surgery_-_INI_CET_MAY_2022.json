Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) medication used to treat breast cancer in men and women and as a prophylactic agent against breast cancer in women. Indications Treatment of breast cancer in both females and males. Adjuvant treatment of breast cancer after patients have completed their primary treatment with surgery and radiation. Treatment of female patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (non-invasive breast cancer) after surgery and radiation to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer. Breast cancer risk reduction in certain patients at high risk (5-year risk = 1.67% calculated by the Gail Model). It selectively binds to estrogen receptors, producing both estrogenic and anti-estrogen effects; because it has two actions, it is patient-specific as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). In the breast tissue, it antagonistically competes with estrogen for binding sites and causes antiestrogenic and antitumor effects. It slows cell cycling through downstream intracellular processes, which classifies it as cytostatic. In bone, it stimulates estrogen receptors instead of blocking them, exerting an estrogenic agonist effect, and may prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It also acts as an estrogen agonist in premenopausal women's hypothalamus, increasing gonadotropin levels and can induce ovulation. It is the DOC for hormone therapy in Premenopausal females with breast CA.

In every 2 to 3 months, the medial part of growth is sloughed due to a decrease in vascularity. Due to this, there is partial relief in jaundice. Whenever sloughing will occur, bleeding also follows ( melena ). Characteristic feature: Waxing and waning of jaundice and melena. These features are seen only in 1/3rd of ampullary CA patients. In clinical practice, all these kinds of periampullary carcinoma are joined by the occurrence that they have a higher frequency of resectability compared to the pancreatic head cancers, which represent as much as 90% of the tumours (both resectable and unresectable) of the periampullary area. The clinical picture of periampullary carcinoma is mainly related in most patients to an early occurrence of jaundice , thus contributing to the early detection and a higher resection rate. The macroscopic appearance of periampullary carcinoma includes: a) intramural tumours \u2013 inside the ampulla, without any protrusion inside the duodenum; b) extramural tumours \u2013 polypoid tumours protruding through the ampullary orifice into the duodenum, c) ulcerative cancers of the ampulla , which is associated with the worst prognosis . According to the microscopic classification, there are two main histological types of periampullary carcinoma: the \u201c intestinal type \u201d (similar to tubular carcinoma of the stomach or the colon and the \u201c pancreaticobiliary type \u201d (characterized by papillary projections with scant fibrous cores) Immunohistochemical staining pattern of apo mucins and cytokeratins is different for the two periampullary carcinoma histological types: positivity for MUC2, CK20, CDX2 and CD10 is typical of the periampullary carcinoma-intestinal type whereas positivity for MUC1 and CK7 is predominant in pancreaticobiliary adenocarcinomas .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - Common bile duct (CBD) stone is a relatively frequent disorder with a 10-20% prevalence in patients with gallstones .

The procedure requires restoration of GI continuity through pancreaticojejunostomy, hepaticojejunostomy, and gastrojejunostomy. Pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) or Longmire-Traverso procedure is the preferred surgery for carcinoma head of the pancreas as it preserves the pylorus and a portion of the stomach and duodenum. Whipple's procedure is reserved for cases where the entire duodenum needs to be removed or when the tumor is encroaching on the first part of the duodenum or the distal stomach. PPPD involves preserving the stomach, 2cm of the first part of the duodenum, and their neurovascular supply.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Duodenal Fistula Characteristics of proximal small intestine fistula: Increased output Increased fluid and electrolyte loss Increased loss of digestive capacity An enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) is an aberrant connection between the intra-abdominal gastrointestinal (GI) tract and skin/wound. Enterocutaneous fistulas are classified according to their location and daily output volume. There are several ways in which ECF has been classified, including by volume of daily output , etiology, and source. These factors dictate treatment and morbidity, and mortality rates. Most often, a high-output ECF is characterized as one with >500 mL/24 hours , low output <200 mL/24 hours , and a moderate output fistula between 200 and 500 mL/24 hours . While most ECFs are iatrogenic (75\u201385%), between 15 and 25% occur spontaneously. Common causes of iatrogenic ECF are trauma; operations for malignancy associated with extensive adhesiolysis or in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); and trauma. Concerning postoperative small bowel fistulae, about half are from an anastomotic leak, with the other half occurring from accidental injury to the small bowel during dissection. Spontaneous fistulae occur from IBD (most common), malignancy, appendicitis, diverticulitis, radiation, tuberculosis/actinomycosis, and ischemia. Organ of origin is another classification used for ECF and is useful as well in consideration of management options: type I (abdominal, esophageal, gastroduodenal), type II (small bowel), type III (large bowel), and type IV (enter atmospheric, regardless of origin). Proximal fistulas are associated with higher output, greater fluid and electrolyte loss, and greater loss of digestive capacity. Distal fistulas tend to have lower output, making them easier to manage and more likely to close spontaneously</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Duodenal Fistula: The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine and plays an essential role in the digestion and absorption of nutrients. A duodenal fistula can cause leakage of digestive juices and partially digested food, leading to malabsorption of nutrients. Malabsorption can result in nutritional complications such as weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances. Duodenal fistulas can b e managed with nutritional support such as TPN or enteral nutrition , but surgical intervention may be necessary in some cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - Pancreatic fistula is an abnormal connection between the pancreatic ductal epithelium and another epithelium surface . This is due to a disruption of the pancreatic duct leading to the pancreatic fluid leaking, producing erosion, and forming different pathways resulting in internal and external pancreatic fistulas. Option B - Option D The most common cause of colonic fistulas is abdominal surgery . Diseases that cause inflammation of the GI tract, such as Crohn's disease and diverticular disease , can also cause fistulas to form. Other causes include cancer, radiation therapy link, and trauma or injury to the abdomen.</p>\n<p></p>",

Mostly sporadic (96%) Rest 4%: Familial ccRCC and papillary RCC arise from proximal tubule epithelial cells, whereas the chromophobe RCC and collecting duct tumors arise from the distal tubules. Usually, patients are asymptomatic until the malignancy has advanced. The classic symptoms include flank pain, hematuria, and palpable renal mass and are seen in only 9% of the cases. The classical triad is seen in advanced disease Flank pain is due to the mass effect or stretch of the renal capsule. The hematuria is due to tumor infiltration into the renal medulla and collecting ducts. It can be differentiated from the glomerular bleed by the absence of acanthocytes/ red cell casts on the microscopy. Depending on the extent of bleeding, the patients can complain of passing clots and colicky pain. On physical examination, an abdominal mass can be palpable, which moves with respiration. The examination of the testes is to evaluate for left-sided varicocele as the left-sided spermatic vein drains into the left renal vein.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>2, 3 and 4 The gonads, and adrenal glands, to a lesser extent, produce androgens via several steps originating with the membrane substance, cholesterol. Testosterone once formed binds intracellular androgen receptors throughout the body where it can exert its effects. A more potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) arises via conversion from testosterone, which is catalyzed by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. 17a17a-hydroxylase 17,20: 17,20-lyase 21:21-hydroxylase 38: 3-HSD (hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) 176: 176-HSD (hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) 5a-R: 5a-reductase While testosterone and DHT are both androgenic steroids, they have different effects throughout the body. Testosterone is largely responsible for the growth seen at puberty, increased muscle mass, and even increased hematocrit in males versus females. DHT, on the other hand, has roles in fetal differentiation of external male genitalia, male hair patterns and lack thereof, and also prostatic growth. Medications such as finasteride and dutasteride are 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors designed to decrease the production of DHT. Statement 4 - Thus by inhibiting 5-alpha reductase, 5-DHT level will decrease, and thus indirectly; testosterone level will increase. Statement 1 and 2 - 5-\u03b1 Reductase inhibitors also depress serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations by approximately 50% . Finasteride is available in 1 mg and 5 mg tablets. The usual dose for androgenic alopecia is 1 mg once daily and the usual dose for BPH is 5 mg once daily. Dutasteride is available as a 0.5 mg capsule and the usual dose for BPH is 0.5 mg once daily.</p>\n<p></p>",

Often there will be undermining in the wound, our underlying pockets of infection , which can in turn lead to osteomyelitis (infection of the bone or bone marrow) if left untreated. The wound itself will typically be painless unless there is also infection or an arterial component to the ulcer. The limb will generally maintain a normal pulse , barring additional circulatory components to the ulcer. The wound should be thoroughly debrided down to healthy, bleeding tissue. Often there is infection underneath the superficial layer of necrotic tissue, even extending down into the bone and bone marrow.

Full-thickness skin grafts can provide skin coverage in wounds in which healing by second intention, primary closure, or flap repair would not be optimal. Advantages of FTSGs are that they do not alter the architecture of the recipient site and are relatively easy for both the patient and the surgeon. The main complication of this procedure is that partial or full-thickness graft failure may occur. FTSGs have advantages over PTSGs, and these include less contraction on healing, generally better aesthetic result, and thicker skin that is more resistant trauma.

It is included in a spectrum of injury, from FCI to non-FCI and frostnip. Patients are at high risk for ischemic tissue injury and necrosis. Patients that survive cold tissue injury are prone to secondary infection and dehydration from loss of the skin barrier. Frostbite causes injury in the following ways: Direct damage of the cold to the tissues Indirect damage caused by dehydration Formation of ice crystals that leads to alteration in electrolytes and lipid layers Stasis of the microvessels leading to thrombus formation and ischemia Reperfusion injury Management of frost bite: Patients should have protection from further injury by covering exposed areas. The care of patients with frostbite begins with rewarming in the field if there is no anticipation of refreezing, as thaw-refreezing may worsen injuries. Patients with systemic hypothermia should be managed by raising core temperature above 35 degrees C using warm IV fluids, and this should precede warming of the affected extremity Remove patients from the wind.

The injured area should be kept clean and dry and efforts made to prevent further injury, as well as to prevent infection. Overly aggressive surgical debridement may remove skin that is otherwise viable, so complete rewarming should be achieved before surgical debridement.

It may arise via contiguous spread from adjacent structures or by the hematogenous route from a distant site. The psoas is surrounded by a rich venous plexus, which could explain its predisposition to infection from hematogenous sprea Statement 2 - Initially, psoas abscess was believed to be mainly caused by TB of the spine (Pott's disease). In recent years a primary psoas abscess due to haematogenous spread from an occult source is more common, especially in immunocompromised and older patients, as well as in association with intravenous drug misuse. Statement 3 - Clinical presentation is with the classic triad of back pain with psoas spasm, lassitude and fever but is present in only 30% of patients. Back pain is the most frequently encountered symptom, with a mean duration of 10-11 days before presentation. On examination, the presence of a limp, palpable mass in the inguinal region, severe pain upon passive hyperextension of the hip or active flexion of the psoas against the examiner\u2019s hand can be specific for psoas abscess. A swelling may point to the groin as it tracks along iliopsoas. Pain may be elicited by passive extension of the hip or a fixed flexion of the hip evident on inspection. The initial treatment of primary psoas abscess involves the empiric use These should have coverage against most gram positive organisms, including MRSA, with vancomycin, linezolid or clindamycin being appropriate choices. In secondary psoas abscess a mixed flora of enteric pathogens predominate. Antibiotics need to have coverage for both gram negative and anaerobic bacteria. CT-guided percutaneous drainage (PCD) or surgical drainage are the two definitive treatment modalities. PCD is less invasive and is currently the treatment of choice, especially in primary psoas abscess.</p>\n<p></p>",

The resistant inertia that occurs to the brain at the time of injury, preceding and following its sudden acceleration against the solid skull, causes shearing of the axonal tracts of the white matter. Road traffic accidents (RTAs) are the most frequent cause of DAI, with assault or falls also common aetiologies. DAI may also present as a consequence of child abuse , particularly in shaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma.

Whilst non-contrast CT imaging of the head is the mainstay initial investigation following head injury, DAI is poorly picked up through this modality. Even severe cases of DAI can have relatively normal CT imaging .

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Presence of Pneumoperitoneum The presence of pneumoperitoneum on imaging would warrant a laparotomy as it indicates visceral perforation which can lead to secondary peritonitis. Secondary peritonitis usually requires surgery along with antibiotics. Advance one grade for multiple injuries, each up to grade III \"Vascular injury\" (i.e. pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula) appears as a focal collection of vascular contrast which decreases in attenuation on delayed images \"Active bleeding\" - focal or diffuse collection of vascular contrast which increases in size or attenuation on a delayed (i.e. later) phase</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: The initial hemoglobin level should be carefully assessed to monitor blood loss. Patients who are stabilized after crystalloid infusion can also be managed conservatively but a lower threshold for surgery must be kept. But hemoglobin fall from 12mg/dl to 10 mg/dl is not an indication for laparotomy as the fall in hemoglobin is not that marked. Option C: Extraperitoneal bladder rupture can be managed by decompression with a urinary catheter. Later a cystography can be done to confirm healing. Extraperitoneal rupture is the most common type of bladder injury, accounting for ~85% (range 80-90%) of cases. It is usually the result of pelvic fractures or penetrating trauma. Cystography reveals a variable path of extravasated contrast material. CT cystogram demonstrates extravasated contrast material confined to the perivesical space within the extraperitoneal pelvis (arrows). The extravasated contrast material demonstrates the typical \"molar tooth\" appearance CT cystogram demonstrates extravasated contrast material confined to the perivesical space within the extraperitoneal pelvis (arrows). The extravasated contrast material demonstrates the typical \"molar tooth\" appearance CT cystogram demonstrates extraperitoneal perivesicular extravasation with the typical molar tooth appearance (solid arrows). There is extension into the rectus abdominis muscle as well as the superficial fatty layer (fascia of Camper) and deeper membranous layer (Scarpa fascia) of the subcutaneous fascia (open arrow). Option D: Air in the gallbladder can be seen in acute cholecystitis if gas-forming organisms cause secondary bacterial infection (emphysematous cholecystitis). Fig: This computerized tomography scan shows gas within the wall of the gallbladder (horizontal arrow) as well as within the lumen of the gallbladder (vertical arrow). Emphysematous cholecystitis, known less commonly as clostridial cholecystitis, is an acute infection of the gallbladder wall caused by gas-forming organisms (eg, Clostridium or Escherichia coli ) that is generally considered a surgical emergency. An infrequent, insidious, and rapidly progressive form of acute cholecystitis , emphysematous cholecystitis is characterized by early gangrene, perforation of the gallbladder and high mortality. It is managed with antibiotics and intravenous fluids. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the surgery of choice.</p>\n<p></p>",
