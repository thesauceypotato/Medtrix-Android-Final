      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Foveal Detachment The retinal pigment epithelium can usually maintain adhesion with the overlying neurosensory retina through various mechanisms. Foveal detachment and macular break resolution result from the release or weakening of vitreous traction on the fovea. Reattachment of the foveal retina preserves fair to good visual acuity.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Surgical intervention is contraindicated in eyes in which foveal detachment flattens and develops a pseudo-operculum and when a posterior vitreous detachment develops in an eye with a stage 2 macular break.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. These mechanisms include active transport of subretinal fluid and interdigitation of outer segments and the retinal pigment epithelium microvilli. Option: C. With retinal detachment , these mechanisms are overwhelmed, separating the neurosensory (inner layers) retina from the retinal pigment epithelial layer. Option: D. Retinal detachment occurs when subretinal fluid accumulates between the neurosensory retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. This process can occur in three ways. One mechanism involves a break in the retina, allowing the vitreous to enter the subretinal space directly. This is known as a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment . Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are often due to retinal tears associated with posterior vitreous detachment or trauma.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Careful biomicroscopic vitreous examination and microperimetry with the scanning laser ophthalmoscope are beneficial methods for adequately examining patients.</p>\n<p></p>",

The genetic locus is 5q31, and the gene involved is TGFB1. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. Signs include: Subtle superficial stromal tiny whitish dots are initial lesions.
