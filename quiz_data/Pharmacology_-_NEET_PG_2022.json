In an overdose, these pathways are saturated, and more acetaminophen is subsequently metabolized to NAPQI by cytochrome P450. NAPQI is a toxic substance that is safely reduced by glutathione to nontoxic mercaptate and cysteine compounds, which are then renally excreted. An overdose depletes the stores of glutathione, and once they reach less than 30% of normal, NAPQI levels increase and subsequently binds to hepatic macromolecules causing hepatic necrosis. This is irreversible. NAC is nearly 100% hepatoprotective when it is given within 8 hours after an acute acetaminophen ingestion. It prevents the binding of NAPQI to hepatic macromolecules, acts as a substitute for glutathione, is a precursor for sulfate, and reduces NAPQI back to acetaminophen. Indications for NAC include: Serum levels that fall in the toxic range according to the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, An APAP level greater than 10 mcg/mL with an unknown time of ingestion, A dose of acetaminophen greater than 140 mg/kg taken more than 8 hours ago, Abnormal labs with ingestion more than 24 hours ago, and Ingestion with any evidence of liver injury.

Warfarinization with large loading doses or without initial concomitant heparinization, are common clues in the clinical history, as in the patient presented herein. Pathophysiology: Warfarin inactivates vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. At the same time, vitamin K-dependent proteins C and S are inactivated.
