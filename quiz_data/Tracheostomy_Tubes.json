Each cuff can be inflated alternately to prevent pressure necrosis at one site in a double cuff tube. Uncuffed endotracheal tubes are used for children <8 years old. Because the cricoid is the narrowest part of the airway, cuffs are unnecessary and may lead to tracheal stenosis. However, modern high-volume/low-pressure cuffs have become accepted by children. Option: C. In the long flange tube, extra-length tracheostomy tubes are used when pre-tracheal tissues are thick or swollen or pass a growth or stenosis in traches. Flange, in these cases, is movable and fixed at a desired place according to the thickness of the tissues of the neck. Option: D.

Silicone: bacteria and secretions do not adhere to the tube, and there is a minimum of crusting. Siliconized pvc: it has the properties of both PVC and silicon, i.e., it is thermolabile and adjusts to the tracheal wall, while silicon prevents crusting. Silastic: it is soft and nonirritating and minimises crusting. Armoured tubes are plastic tubes reinforced by a spiral or rings of stainless steel. They are not easily linked.
