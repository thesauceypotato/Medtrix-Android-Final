In this technique: Premedication is done with metoclopramide and ranitidine. Preoxygenation is done for 3-5 minutes. An intravenous induction agent is given. Ketamine is the preferred agent for induction because it maximally preserves airway reflexes. Succinylcholine is given. As soon as succinylcholine is given the assistant applies cricoid pressure. This is called Sellick's Cricoid pressure will compress the esophagus between the fingers and vertebral column preventing aspiration.
