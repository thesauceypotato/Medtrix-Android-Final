Vocal polyp is the result of vocal abuse or misuse. Other contributing factors are allergies and smoking. Primarily, it affects men in the age group of 30\u201350 years.

Reinke\u2019s edema is bilateral symmetrical swelling of the whole of the membranous part of the vocal cords, most often seen in middle-aged men and women. This is due to edema of the subepithelial space (Reinke\u2019s space) of the vocal lines. Option: D. Contact ulcer is due to faulty voice production in which vo- cal processes of arytenoids hammer against each other, resulting in ulceration and granuloma formation. Some cases are due to gastric reflux. Chief complaints are a hoarse voice, a constant desire to clear the throat, and pain in the throat which is worse on phonation.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is of use in patients who require intermittent positive pressure ventilation. A cuffed tracheostomy tube has to be used to prevent air leak and hence maintain positive pressure. A cuffed endotracheal tube is not to be put in for more than three days since it is more likely to cause ulceration granulation and subglottic and laryngeal stenosis.</p>\n<p></p>",
