Less commonly, the sac comes through the superior lumbar triangle , which is bounded by the twelfth rib above, medially by sacrospinalis, and laterally by the posterior border of the internal oblique muscle. Primary lumbar hernias are rare but may be mimicked by incisional hernias arising through flank incisions for renal operations, or through incisions for bone grafts harvested from the iliac crest. Differential diagnosis : A lumbar hernia must be distinguished from: A lipoma; An incisional hernia, such as from a renal operation A cold (tuberculous) abscess pointing to this position; A pseudo-hernia due to local muscular paralysis. Lumbar pseudo-hernia can result from any interference with the nerve supply of the affected muscles, the most common cause being an injury to the subcostal nerve during a kidney operation. Treatment: The natural history is for these hernias to increase in size and surgery is recommended. Lumbar hernias can be approached by open or laparoscopic surgery. The defects can be difficult to close with sutures and mesh is recommended.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A.

A pelvic abscess can also occur as a sequel to any case of diffuse peritonitis and is common after anastomotic leakage following colorectal surgery . Clinical features: The most characteristic symptoms are pelvic pain, diarrhea, and the passage of mucus in the stools. Rectal examination reveals a bulging of the anterior rectal wall , which, when the abscess is ripe, becomes softly cystic. Investigation and management: Left to nature, a proportion of these abscesses burst into the rectum , after which the patient almost always recovers rapidly. If this does not occur, the abscess should be drained deliberately. In women, vaginal drainage through the posterior fornix is often chosen. In other cases, when the abscess is pointing into the rectum, rectal drainage is employed. If any uncertainty exists, the presence of pus should be confirmed by ultrasonography or CT scanning. Laparotomy is rarely necessary and rectal drainage of a pelvic abscess is far preferable to suprapubic drainage , which risks exposing the general peritoneal cavity to infection. It is, however, increasingly common to insert drainage tubes percutaneously, e.g., via the buttock or the vagina or rectum under CT guidance.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A: The pelvis is the most common site of abscess formation because the vermiform appendix is often pelvic in position and the fallopian tubes are also frequent sites of infection Option B: Not definite investigation Option C: Not associated</p>\n<p></p>",

Staff with open, infected skin lesions should not enter the operating theatres . Ideally, neither should affect patients, especially if they are having a prosthesis implanted.

It is also called recto-rectus mesh repair.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The term \u2018mesh\u2019 refers to prosthetic material, either a net or a fat sheet, that is used to strengthen a hernia repair. Positioning : The strength of a mesh repair depends on host-tissue ingrowth. Meshes should be laid in a tension-free manner on a farm, well-vascularised tissue bed with a generous overlap of the hernia zone The mesh can be placed On top of the muscle/fascia in the subcutaneous space (only) Within the defect (inlay) Immediately deep to the muscle layers in the abdominal wall (subway) Extraperitoneal Intraperitoneally. Only repair : The mesh is placed overlying the defect (opening) made by the hernia. The mesh is fixed to the fascia using sutures to close the defect. This method is relatively easy to perform. It does, however, come with some disadvantages. These disadvantages include: A lot of suturing is required to secure the mesh around and onto the fascia surface; There is an increased chance of seroma over the mesh when placed using the onlay Technique. Higher risk of recurrence due to the mechanical disadvantage of the only placement of the mesh, such that there is significant pressure against the mesh. Inlay repair : The inlay technique involves placing the mesh between the edges of the fascia where the defect made by the hernia is. Inlay placement does not close the gap, rather the mesh is fixed with sutures to the edges of the gap to bridge the defect. This technique is also relatively easy to perform. If used over larger defects, then the risk of recurrence increases as well as the formation of seromas and infection. There is also the mechanical disadvantage here where pressure against the mesh can again lead to recurrence, but more so if the technique is applied to a large gap. Sublay: Mesh placement in a pocket formed anterior to the peritoneum and posterior to the rectus abdominis. It is also called recto-rectus mesh repair. Underlay : The underlay technique involves placing the mesh on the underside of the gap or inside the fascia. Because of this technique, is also referred to as the inside-out technique for hernia repair. The sutures are circumferentially and evenly used to fix the mesh and close the gap. Because the pressure is stabilized, there is less risk of hernia recurrence . Because of its placement, too, there is less risk of seroma formation and infection .
