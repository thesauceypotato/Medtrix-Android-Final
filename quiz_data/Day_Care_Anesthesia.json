In day care anesthesia, patients undergo anesthesia for their procedure and are discharged on the same day once they have recovered from the effects of anesthesia and the procedure itself. This approach allows patients to return home or to a non-hospital setting shortly after their surgery or intervention, without the need for an overnight hospital stay . Day care anesthesia is commonly used for a wide range of elective and minimally invasive procedures , and it aims to provide effective anesthesia while minimizing the patient's length of stay in the healthcare facility.</li><li>\u2022 Day care anesthesia , also known as ambulatory anesthesia or outpatient anesthesia , refers to the administration of anesthesia for surgical or medical procedures that are performed on an outpatient basis, typically in a healthcare facility such as a hospital, surgical center, or clinic.
