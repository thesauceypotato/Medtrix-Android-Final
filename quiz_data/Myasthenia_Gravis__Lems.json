      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Neuromuscular junction destruction Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies attack the acetylcholine receptors (AChR) at the neuromuscular junction, leading to their destruction and impaired neuromuscular transmission.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Myasthenia Gravis It is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue. Cause: Autoantibodies that bind to acetylcholine receptors (AChR) at the neuromuscular junction. Features: The most common clinical presentation is the weakness of the ocular muscles, leading to ptosis and diplopia . Weakness of the bulbar muscles, leading to dysarthria, dysphagia, and respiratory distress. Associated with thymic abnormalities in up to 80% of patients, including thymoma, thymic hyperplasia, or thymic involution. Myasthenic crisis is a life-threatening condition characterized by respiratory muscle weakness and requires prompt recognition and intervention. Treatment: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, immunosuppressive drugs, plasmapheresis, and thymectomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Neuronal loss in the spinal cord: It is not a key pathological feature of myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. Option: C. Cerebral cortical atrophy: It is not a key pathological feature of myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is primarily a disorder of the neuromuscular junction. Option: D. White matter demyelination: It is not a key pathological feature of myasthenia gravis. Demyelination is a feature of some other neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Most sensitive investigation for Myasthenia Gravis : Single fiber EMG Most specific Investigation for Myasthenia Gravis: Antibodies to acetylcholine receptors (AChR)</p>\n<p></p>",
