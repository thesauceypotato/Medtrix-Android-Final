It can be distinguished from sinus tachycardia by the P-wave morphology, which usually differs from sinus p waves depending on the location of the focus. Focal AT tends to originate in areas of complex atrial anatomy, such as the crista terminalis, valve annuli, atrial septum, and atrial muscle extending along cardiac thoracic veins (superior vena cava, coronary sinus, and pulmonary veins), and the location can often be estimated by the P-wave morphology. AT from the atrial septum will frequently have a narrower P-wave duration than sinus rhythm. AT from the left atrium will usually have a monophasic, positive P wave in lead V1 and negative P waves in I and aVL Option D - During 2:1 conduction- depending on the atrial rate, the P wave may fall on top of the T wave or, the P wave may fall coincident with the QRS.</p>\n<p></p>",
