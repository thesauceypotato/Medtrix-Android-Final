As a result, the body compensates by increasing lipolysis in adipose tissue, releasing free fatty acids into the bloodstream. These fatty acids are transported to the liver, where they undergo beta-oxidation to produce acetyl CoA. Because of insulin deficiency, oxaloacetate is preferentially used for gluconeogenesis, leading to reduced entry of acetyl CoA into the TCA cycle. This accumulation of acetyl CoA results in enhanced ketogenesis, producing ketone bodies such as acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, which contribute to the state of ketosis.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

Understanding these metabolic shifts is critical in managing and preventing complications associated with diabetic ketoacidosis.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
