Frequent replacement would not be a significant concern.</li><li>\u2022 (C) It has a very long half-life (Incorrect) While it is true that radium-226 has a long half-life, this alone is not the reason it is no longer used. The primary concern is the hazardous decay product (radon gas), not the longevity of radium itself.</li><li>\u2022 (D) It is a very unstable element (Incorrect) Radium is radioactive, but it is not considered \"very unstable\" compared to other isotopes used in radiotherapy. Its instability is not the primary reason for its discontinuation in medical treatments.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
