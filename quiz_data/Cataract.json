      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Occurrence of \u201clens within a lens phenomenon\u201d is a common finding in such patients This is a classic case presentation of mature senile cataracts. A patient with senile cataract often presents with a history of gradual progressive deterioration and disturbance in vision. Decreased visual acuity is the most common complaint of patients with senile cataracts. Increased glare is another common complaint of patients with senile cataracts. This complaint may include an entire spectrum from a decrease in contrast sensitivity in brightly lit environments or disabling glare during the day to debilitating glare with oncoming headlights at night. At times, the nuclear changes are concentrated in the inner layers of the lens , resulting in a refractile area in the center of the lens, which often is seen best within the red reflex by retinoscopy or direct ophthalmoscopy. Such a phenomenon, which some call \u201clens within a lens phenomenon,\u201d may lead to monocular diplopia that is not correctable with spectacles, prisms, or contact lenses.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The progression of cataracts may frequently increase the dioptric power of the lens resulting in a mild-to-moderate degree of myopia or myopic shift. Consequently, presbyopic patients report an increase in their near vision and less need for reading glasses as they experience the so-called second sight. However, such occurrence is temporary, and, as the optical quality of the lens deteriorates, the second sight is eventually lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Slit lamp examination should not only concentrate on evaluating the lens opacity but the other ocular structures as well (eg, conjunctiva, cornea, iris, anterior chamber). Corneal thickness and the presence of corneal opacities , such as corneal guttate, must be checked carefully. The appearance of the lens must be noted meticulously before and after pupillary dilation. After dilation, nuclear size and brunettes as indicators of cataract density can be determined before phacoemulsification surgery. The lens position and integrity of the zonular fibers also should be checked because lens subluxation may indicate previous eye trauma, antecedent ocular surgery, metabolic disorders, or premature cataracts. Option: C. Optic nerve and retinal problems may account for the visual disturbance experienced by the patient. Furthermore, the prognosis after lens extraction is affected significantly by preoperative detection of pathologies in the posterior pole (eg, macular edema, retinal dystrophy, optic atrophy, severe glaucomatous cupping, age-related macular degeneration) and in the retinal periphery (eg, retinal breaks or extensive vitreoretinal traction). Option: D. The role of nutritional deficiencies in senile cataracts has not been proven or established. However, a high intake of the 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic acid and linolenic acid reportedly may result in an increased risk of developing age-related nuclear opacity.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Typically, myopic shift and second sight are not seen in cortical and posterior subcapsular cataracts. A cortical cataract generally is not clinically relevant until late in its progression when cortical spokes compromise the visual axis. The visual significance of oil droplet nuclear cataracts and small posterior subcapsular cataracts is evaluated best with a normal-sized pupil to determine if the visual axis is obscured.</p>\n<p></p>",

One of the earliest visual disturbances with the cataract is glare or intolerance of bright light Uniocular polyopia (i.e., doubling or trebling of objects). It is also one of the early symptoms. It occurs due to irregular refraction by the lens Coloured halos . This is due to the breaking of white light into a colored spectrum due to the presence of water droplets in the lens. Black spots in front of eyes. Image blur, distortion of Images, and misty vision. Deterioration of vision. It is painless and gradually progressive.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A . Patients with central opacities (e.g., cupuliform cataract i.e. Posterior subcapsular cataract) have early loss of vision. These patients see better when the pupil is dilated due to dim light in the evening (day blindness). Option: C. In patients with peripheral opacities (e.g., cuneiform cataract) visual loss is delayed and the vision improves in bright light when the pupil is contracted. Option: D . In patients with nuclear sclerosis , distant vision deteriorates due to progressive index myopia. Such patients may be able to read without presbyopic glasses. This improvement in near vision is referred to as \u2018second sight\u2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>SIGNS: Visual acuity testing. Depending upon the location and maturation of the cataract, the visual acuity may range from 6/9 to just PL + Oblique illumination examination. It reveals the color of the lens in the papillary area which varies in different types of cataracts Test for iris shadow . When an oblique beam of light is thrown on the pupil, a crescentic shadow of the pupillary margin of the iris will be formed on the greyish opacity of the lens, as long as a clear cortex is present between the opacity and the pupillary margin When the lens is completely transparent or opaque, no iris shadow is formed. Hence, the presence of an iris shadow is a sign of immature cataracts. Distant direct ophthalmoscopic examination- A reddish-yellow fundal glow is observed in the absence of any opacity in the media. A partial cataractous lens shows a black shadow against the red glow in the area of the The complete cataractous lens does not even reveal the red glow Slit lamp examination to assess site, size, color, and hardness of the lens</p>\n<p></p>",
