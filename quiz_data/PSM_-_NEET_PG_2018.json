RNTCP is currently using CB-NAAT for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and MDR-TB in high-risk population like HIV positive and pediatric groups. Nikshay: TB surveillance using case-based web-based IT system. Central TB Division in collaboration with National Informatics Center has undertaken the initiative to develop a case-based web-based application named Nikshay. This soft- ware was launched in May 2012 and has following functional components: Master management User details TB patient registration and details of diagnosis, DOT provider, HIV status, follow-up, contact tracing, outcomes. Details of solid and liquid culture and DST, LPA, CBNMT details MDR-TB patient registration with details Referral and transfer of patients Private health facility registration and TB notification Mobile application for TB notification SMS alerts to patients on registration SMS alerts to programme officers Automated periodic reports \u2013  Case finding \u2013  Sputum conversion \u2013  Treatment outcome. TB notification: In order to ensure proper diagnosis and management of TB cases, and to reduce TB transmission and the emergence and spread of MDR-TB, it is essential to have complete information of all TB cases. According to the Government of India notification dated 7th May 2012, it is now mandatory for all healthcare providers to notify every TB case to local authorities, i.e. District Health Officer/Chief Medical Officer of a district and Municipal Health Officer, every month in a given format. At present, 57,000 health facilities have been registered and 35,000 patients have been notified. Ban on TB serology: The serological tests are based on anti- body response, which is highly variable in TB and may reflect remote infection rather than active disease. Currently available serological tests are having poor specificity and should not    be used for the diagnosis of pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB. Their import, manufacturing, sale, distribution and use are banned by the Government of India.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options B, C and D are false.</p>\n<p></p>",

Statement of P value is thus an inadequate, although common end-point of case-control studies. A small p -value (typically \u2264 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis. A large p -value (> 0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject the null hypothesis. p -values very close to the cutoff (0.05) are considered to be marginal (could go either way).

The annual estimate for the incidence and prevalence of kala-azar cases worldwide is 0.5 million and 2.5 million, respectively. Of these, 90% of the confirmed cases occur in India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sudan. In India, it is a serious problem in Bihar, West Bengal and eastern Uttar Pradesh where there is underreporting of kala- azar and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis in women and children 0\u20139 years of age. Untreated cases of kala-azar are associated with up to 90% mortality, with treatment reduces to 15% and 3.4% even in specialized hospitals. It is also associated with up to 20% in subclinical infection. Spraying of DDT helped control kala-azar; however, there are reports of the vector Phlebotomus argentipes developing resistance. Also lymphadenopathy, a major presenting feature in India raises the possibility of a new vector or a variant of the disease. The widespread coexistence of malaria and kala-azar in Bihar may lead to a difficulty in diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. In addition, reports of the organism developing resistance to sodium antimony gluconate\u2014 the main drug for the treatment \u2014would make its eradication difficult.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options A, B and C are false.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Clinical trials in India have reported encouraging results with amphotericin B (recommended as a third-line drug by the National Malaria Eradication Programme).

Preliminary studies using autoclaved Leishmania major mixed with BCG have been successful in preventing infection with Leishmania donovani . Until a safe and effective vaccine is developed, a combination of sandfly control, detection and treatment of patients and prevention of drug resistance is the best approach for control- ling kala-azar.</p>\n<p></p>",

The consumer considers water is hard if large amounts of soap are required to produce lather. The hardness in water is caused mainly by four dissolved compounds. These are: Calcium bicarbonate Magnesium bicarbonate Calcium sulphate Magnesium sulphate The presence of any one of these compounds produces hardness. There are others which are of less importance. Chlorides and nitrates of calcium and magnesium can also cause hardness but they occur generally in small amounts. Iron, manganese and aluminium compounds also cause hardness, but as they generally are present in such small amounts, it is customary not to consider them in connection with hardness. Hardness is classified as carbonate and non-carbonate. The carbonate hardness which was formerly designated as \u2018temporary\u2019 hardness is due to the presence of calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The non-carbonate hardness formerly designated as \u2018permanent\u2019 hardness is due to calcium and magnesium sulphates, chlorides and nitrates. Hardness in water is expressed in terms of \u2018milliequivalent per litre (mEq/L)\u2019. One mEq/L of hardness producing ion is equal to 50 mg CaCO 3 (50 ppm) in 1 litre of water.

The National Health Policy was approved by the Parliament in 1983. It laid down the long-term demographic goal of NRR = 1 by the year 2000 which implies a 2-child family norm - through the attainment of a birth rate of 21 and a death rate of 9 per thousand populations, and a couple protection rate of 60 per- cent by the year 2000. The Sixth and Seventh Five-Year Plans were accordingly set to achieve these goals. The National Health Policy also called for restructuring the healthcare delivery system to achieve HFA/2000 AD, and family planning has been accorded a central place in the health development. Couple protection rate (CPR) is an indicator of the prevalence of contraceptive practice in the community. It is defined as the percent of eligible couples effectively protected against childbirth by one or the other approved methods of family planning, viz. sterilization, IUD, condom or oral pills. Sterilization accounts for over 60 percent of effectively protected couples. Demographers are of the view that the demographic goal of NRR= 1 can be achieved only if the CPR exceeds 60 percent.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options B, C and D are false.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is a supplement not a substitute to sand filtration. Chlorine kills pathogenic bacteria, but it has no effect on spores and certain viruses (e.g. polio, viral hepatitis) except in high doses. Apart from its germicidal effect, chlorine has several important secondary properties of value in water treatment: It oxidizes iron, manganese and hydrogen sulphide; it destroys some taste and odor producing constituents; it controls algae and slime organisms; and aids coagulation. Action of chlorine: When chlorine is added to water, there is a formation of hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids. The hydrochloric acid is neutralized by the alkalinity of the water. The hypochlorous acid ionizes to form hydrogen ions and hypochlorite ions, as follows: H2O + Cl2 = HCl + HOCl HOCL= H + OCl The disinfecting action of chlorine is mainly due to the hypochlorous acid , and to a small extent due to the hypochlorite ions. The hypochlorous acid is the most effective form of chlorine for water disinfection. It is more effective (70-80 times) than the hypochlorite ion. Chlorine acts best as a disinfectant when the pH of water is around 7 because of the predominance of hypochlorous acid. When the pH value exceeds 8.5 it is unreliable as a disinfectant because about 90 percent of the hypochlorous acid gets ionized to hypochlorite ions. It is fortunate that most waters have a pH value between 6-7.5.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options B, C and D are false.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Principles of chlorination: First of all, the water to be chlorinated should be clear and free from turbidity. Turbidity impedes efficient chlorination. The point at which the chlorine demand of the water is met is called the \u2018break- point\u2019 . If further chlorine is added beyond the breakpoint, free chlorine (HOCI and OCl) begins to appear in the water. Thirdly the contact period. The presence of free residual chlorine for a contact period of at least 1 hour is essential to kill bacteria and viruses. It should be noted however, that chlorine has no effect on spores, protozoan cysts and helminthic ova , except in higher doses. The minimum recommended concentration of free chlorine is 5 mg/L for one hour . The sum of the chlorine demand of the specific water plus the free residual chlorine of 0.5 mg/L constitutes the correct dose of chlorine to be applied.</p>\n<p></p>",

There are several methods of pasteurization. Three are widely used: Holder (Vat) method: In this process, milk is kept at 63\u201366\u00b0C for at least 30 minutes, and then quickly cooled to 5\u00b0C. Vat method is recommended for small and rural communities. In larger cities, it is going out of use. HTST method: Also known as \u2018high temperature and short time method\u2019. Milk is rapidly heated to a temperature of nearly 72\u00b0C is held at that temperature for not less than 15 seconds, and is then rapidly cooled to 4\u00b0C. This is now the most widely used method. Very large quantities of milk per hour can be pasteurized by this method. UHT method: Also known as \u2018ultra-high temperature method.\u2019 Milk is rapidly heated usually in 2 stages (the second stage usually being under pressure) to 125\u00b0C for a few seconds only.

The test is based on the fact that raw milk contains an enzyme called phosphatase which is destroyed on heating at a temperature which corresponds closely with the standard time and temperature required for pasteurization. At 60\u00b0C for 30 minutes phosphatase is completely destroyed. Consequently, the test is used to detect inadequate pasteurization or the addition of raw milk. Standard plate count: The bacteriological quality of pasteurized milk is determined by the standard plate count. Most countries in the West enforce a limit of 30,000 bacterial count per ml of pasteurized milk. Coliform count: Coliform organisms are usually completely destroyed by pasteurization, and therefore, their presence in pasteurized milk is an indication either of improper pasteurization or post-pasteurization contamination. The standard in most countries is that coliforms be absent in 1 mL of milk.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Soil</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Modes of Transmission: Once an infectious agent leaves a reservoir, it must get transmit- ted to a new host if it is to multiply and cause disease. The route by which an infectious agent is transmitted from a reservoir to another host is called the mode of transmission. Various direct and indirect modes of transmission are: Transplacental transmission: This refers to the transmission of an infectious agent from a pregnant woman to her fetus through the placenta. An example is mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. Person to person: The infectious agent is spread by direct contact between people through touching, biting, kissing, sexual intercourse or direct projection of respiratory drop- lets into another person\u2019s nose or mouth during coughing, sneezing or talking. A familiar example is the transmission of HIV from an infected person to others through sexual intercourse. Direct modes of transmission: Direct transmission refers to the transfer of an infectious agent from an infected host to a new host without the need for intermediates such as air, food, water or other animals. Direct modes of transmission can occur in two main ways: Indirect modes of transmission: Indirect transmission is when infectious agents are transmitted to new hosts through intermediates such as air, food, water, objects or substances in the environment, or other animals. Indirect transmission has three subtypes: Airborne transmission: The infectious agent may be transmitted in dried secretions from the respiratory tract, which can remain suspended in the air for some time. For example, the infectious agent causing tuberculosis can enter a new host through airborne transmission. Vehicle-borne transmission: A vehicle is any non-living substance or object that can be contaminated by an infectious agent which then transmits it to a new host. Contamination refers to the presence of an infectious agent in or on the vehicle. Vector-borne transmission: A vector is an organism, usually an arthropod which transmits an infectious agent    to a new host. Arthropods which act as vectors include houseflies, mosquitoes, lice and ticks.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options A, C and D are false.</p>\n<p></p>",
