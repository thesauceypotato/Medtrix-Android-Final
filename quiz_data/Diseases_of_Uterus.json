      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Secretory phase The presence of secretory vacuoles beneath the nuclei of glandular epithelium in the dating of endometrium denotes the Secretory phase. During the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, the endometrium undergoes changes in preparation for the potential implantation of a fertilized egg. These changes are primarily driven by the hormone progesterone, which is secreted by the corpus luteum in the ovary after ovulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Proliferative phase: This phase of the endometrial cycle occurs prior to the secretory phase. During the proliferative phase, the endometrium thickens and the glandular epithelium proliferates in response to estrogen stimulation. Option: C. Menstrual phase: This phase marks the shedding of the endometrium when implantation does not occur. During this phase, the endometrial tissue is being shed and there is a lack of glandular development. Option: D. Infection: The presence of secretory vacuoles beneath the nuclei of glandular epithelium in the endometrial dating does not denote an infection. Infection would involve the infiltration of pathogens or inflammatory cells, and it would be characterized by signs of inflammation, such as immune cell infiltration and tissue damage</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Leiomyoma The given clinical scenario and a histopathological image showing bundles of smooth muscle cells with well-defined borders and minimal cytological atypia suggests the diagnosis of Leiomyoma</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Leiomymoma Most common tumour in female Benign smooth muscle tumour Estrogen sensitive Increase size with pregnancy and decreased size in menopause Age: 20-40 years Symptoms: asymptomatic, abnormal uterine bleeding, iron deficiency anaemia Histology: Whorled pattern of smooth muscle bundles with well-demarcated borders</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Leiomyosarcoma: Unlike leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas have a high degree of cellularity, marked nuclear pleomorphism, and atypical mitoses. They are also more invasive and have a higher risk of metastasis. Option: C. Angiosarcoma: Angiosarcomas are malignant vascular tumours and usually present as skin lesions. They are characterized by anastomosing channels lined by atypical endothelial cells, which is not seen in the provided image. Option: D. Serous tumour: Serous tumours usually arise from the ovary and rarely involve the uterus. They are characterized by papillary projections lined by cuboidal to columnar cells with clear cytoplasm, which is not seen in the provided image.</p>\n<p></p>",
