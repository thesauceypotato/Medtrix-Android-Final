Renin angiotensin system Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor. Efferent arterioles are more sensitive than afferent arterioles. Low levels of angiotensin II produce an increase in GFR by constricting efferent arterioles. High levels of angiotensin II decreases GFR by constricting both afferent and efferent arterioles thereby decreasing the renal blood flow</p>\n<p></p>",

Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction, retention of sodium and water, and an increase in blood pressure. Option D.

Substance P: Substance P is a neuropeptide that acts as a neurotransmitter in the nervous system, including the enteric nervous system. It is involved in pain perception and inflammation. However, it is not directly responsible for the relaxation of the intestinal segment during peristalsis. Instead, Substance P is known for its role in transmitting pain signals and modulating gastrointestinal motility. Option: B. Acetylcholine: Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in the autonomic nervous system and neuromuscular junctions, including the enteric nervous system. It is a key mediator of smooth muscle contraction in the gastrointestinal tract, rather than relaxation. When released by excitatory neurons, acetylcholine binds to receptors on smooth muscle cells, leading to muscle contractions and peristaltic movements, not relaxation. Option: D. Dopamine from adrenergic fibers: Dopamine is a neurotransmitter primarily associated with the central nervous system, but it is also found in the enteric nervous system. However, dopamine released from adrenergic fibers (which are part of the sympathetic nervous system) generally has inhibitory effects on smooth muscle activity in the gastrointestinal tract. It is not involved in the relaxation of the intestinal segment during peristalsis. Instead, the sympathetic nervous system typically decreases motility and promotes \"rest and digest\" functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The food bolus in the small intestine is sensed by enterochromaffin cells of the intestinal mucosa, which release 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(serotonin). The 5-HT then binds to the receptors on intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs), which when activated, initiate the peristaltic reflex in that segment of the small intestine. Behind the bolus, excitatory transmitters like acetylcholine, Substance P, neuropeptide Y are released in the circular muscle, while these pathways are inhibited in the longitudinal muscle; thus this segment of small intestine (behind the bolus) contracts and lengthens.</p>\n<p></p>",

When the rabbit intestine is bathed in this solution, it leads to rhythmic contractions. Adrenaline is a hormone and neurotransmitter that activates adrenergic receptors, which are part of the sympathetic nervous system. Decrease in the amplitude and frequency of contraction (relaxation of the smooth muscles) is caused by sympathetic agents, that is adrenaline.

Acetyl choline (ACh) typically has the opposite effect, increasing the amplitude and frequency of contractions in the intestine. Option: C. CaCl2 would increase the amplitude of contractions by providing extracellular calcium, which is required for muscle contraction. Option: D. BaCl2 , on the other hand, may block muscle contraction by interfering with calcium channels, but it wouldn't decrease the amplitude and frequency of contractions in the same way as adrenaline.</p>\n<p></p>",

It lasts only till the person continues to think about the number or facts. Working memory is a form of short-term memory that keeps information available, usually for very short periods of time, until the individual plans action based on it. Long term memory It stores memories that can be recollected after years or even for a lifetime. These memories are stored in various parts of the neocortex. The various parts of the memories such as, visual, auditory, olfactory, etc., are localised to the cortical regions concerned with these functions. All These parts of the memories are brought together by long-term changes in the strength of transmission at relevant synaptic junctions so that all the components are brought to consciousness when that particular memory is recalled.</p>\n<p></p>",
