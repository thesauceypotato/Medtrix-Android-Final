      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Extradural Hematoma CT shows a large right extradural haematoma . There are widespread cerebral contusions most prominent in the left frontal lobe . There is traumatic subarachnoid blood in the third and lateral ventricles .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Extradural haematoma is a neurosurgical emergency. It results from the rupture of an artery, vein or venous sinus, in association with a skull fracture. The classical injury is a fracture to the thin squamous temporal bone, with associated damage to the middle meningeal artery. Presentation : Transient loss of consciousness is typical, and the patient may then present in the subsequent lucid interval with a headache but without any neurological deficit. As the haematoma expands, compensation is exhausted with rapid deterioration. There is contralateral hemiparesis, a reduced conscious level and ipsilateral pupillary dilatation , the cardinal signs of brain compression and herniation. Although this \u2018talk and die\u2019 pattern of deterioration occurs in only one-third of cases, it is critically important to recognise the potential for rapid avoidable secondary brain injury in patients who present neurologically intact. Diagnosis : On CT, extradural haematomas appear as a lentiform (lens-shaped or biconvex) hyperdense lesion between the skull and the brain, constrained by the adherence of the dura to the skull. A mass effect may be evident, with compression of the surrounding brain and midline shift. Areas of mixed density suggest active bleeding . A skull fracture will usually be evident. Treatment : Open craniectomy for evacuation of the congealed clot and hemostasis generally is indicated for EDH. In some cases, EDH can be caused by bony venous bleeding that is self-limited and may not require surgical intervention. Generally, patients who meet all of the following criteria may be managed conservatively: clot volume <30 cm, maximum thickness <1.5 cm, and GCS score >8 . Prognosis : Prognosis after successful evacuation is better for EDH than subdural hematoma (SDH). EDHs are associated with lower-energy trauma with less resultant primary brain injury. Good outcomes may be seen in 85% to 90% of patients, with rapid CT scans and intervention.11 In some cases, EDH can also be caused by dural venous sinus tears that rapidly expand and are typically associated with a high degree of morbidity when treated surgically</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Acute Subdural Hematoma On head CT scan, the clot is bright(Hyperdense) or mixed-density, crescent-shaped (lunate), may have a less distinct border, and does not cross the midline due to the presence of the falx. Most SDHs occur over the cerebral hemispheres, but they may also occur between the hemispheres or layer over the tentorium Option: C. Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Trauma is the commonest cause of subarachnoid haemorrhage and this is managed conservatively Option: D. Chronic Subdural Hematoma A true chronic SDH will be nearly as dark as CSF on CT . Traces of white are often seen due to small, recurrent haemorrhages in the collection. These small bleeds may expand the collection enough to make it symptomatic.

This results in an expanding haematoma with rapid deterioration and development of signs of raised ICP reminiscent of extradural haematoma, without the lucid interval. These collections require prompt evacuation, typically by craniotomy or craniectomy. Type II : Older and often anticoagulated, a lower energy injury leads to venous bleeding around the brain. Depending on the total volume of bleeding, the resulting haematoma may present early as acute subdural haematoma, after delay and osmotic expansion as chronic subdural haematoma or may even remain clinically silent. Type III : Present much later with a further \u2018acute-onchronic\u2019 subdural haematoma. On diagnosis, the clotting function should be corrected wherever possible. Bleeds of significant size, with significantly associated midline shift or with deteriorating neurology, require urgent evacuation. Smaller bleeds in neurologically stable patients may be managed conservatively , at least initially: liquefaction of the clot over 7\u201310 days after the bleed may allow for a much less invasive evacuation through burr holes. Since the dura is not as adherent to the brain as it is to the skull, subdural blood is free to expand across the brain surface, giving a diffuse concave appearance.

Simultaneously obtain blood for blood transfusion and cross match Initiate iv fluids. Consider the potential need for operative management. DISABILITY : Assess consciousness Use GCS score. Assess pupils Size/ equality/ reaction. EXPOSURE / ENVIRONMENT: Completely undress the patient but prevent hypothermia. Anterior and posterior nasal packing should be done to prevent nasal bleeding. Resuscitation of patients with hypovolemic shock begins by making the airway secure by ensuring proper ventilation and oxygen therapy. External bleeding is done by the application of pressure and surgical control. Immediately life-threatening pulmonary injuries should be early detected and treated as soon as possible.

Hence, imaging should be done after hard neck collar support and a long spine board. In fact, a cross-table lateral cervical spine X-ray is considered, in the same trolley itself without shifting the patient. A surgeon should accompany the patient if needed so that the patient can be transferred immediately to OR if any hemodynamic instability happens. Simultaneously all patients with blunt trauma require cervical spine immobilisation until the injury is excluded. This is typically accomplished by applying a hard collar or placing sandbags on both sides of the neck with the patient\u2019s forehead taped across the bags to the backboard. Soft collars do not effectively immobilize the cervical spine. for penetrating neck wounds, however, cervical collars are not believed useful because they provide no benefit, but may interfere with assessment and treatment.</p>\n<p></p>",
