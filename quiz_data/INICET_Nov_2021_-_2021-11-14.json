PUV is a membranous fold located in the posterior urethra, typically found just distal to the verumontanum. It is thought to occur due to the persistence of the urogenital membrane. Urethral obstruction can cause dilation of the posterior urethral valve, bladder, and bilateral hydronephrosis, leading to a keyhole sign on prenatal ultrasound and potentially oligohydramnios. If not detected prenatally, PUV may present postnatally as a newborn or young infant with urinary tract symptoms, abdominal distension or and recurrent UTIs. Left untreated, PUV may result in chronic kidney disease, bladder dysfunction, and vesicoureteral reflux. Diagnosis of PUV is typically based on the presence of an elongated posterior valve during the voiding phase of the voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG).</li><li>\u27a4 The most frequent cause of bladder outflow obstruction in male children is the posterior urethral valve (PUV).</li><li>\u27a4 PUV is a membranous fold located in the posterior urethra, typically found just distal to the verumontanum.

The approximate length to be inserted is around 55 cm. The preferred position for inserting the Ryle's tube is in a sitting position with the neck slightly flexed.</li><li>\u27a4 The proper positioning of the tube can be confirmed through auscultation in the epigastric area while injecting a bolus of air or by an abdominal radiograph. The ideal placement for an NG tube used for suction is within the stomach to avoid damage to the duodenum. In contrast, an NG feeding tube should be placed post-pyloric to reduce the risk of aspiration.</li><li>\u27a4 Indications for NG tube usage include gastric decompression in intestinal obstruction, aspiration of gastric fluid, nutritional support, and medication administration. However, some absolute contraindications to NG tube insertion include severe midface trauma and recent nasal surgery.</li><li>\u27a4 A tray of specialized instruments is used for nasogastric tube insertion, including a lubricating jelly, an NG tube, a syringe, and gloves, among others.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Current American Cancer Society guidelines advocate colon cancer screening for the average-risk population beginning at age 50 years. Recommended procedures include yearly fecal occult blood testing (FOBT)/fecal immunohistochemical testing (FIT), flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or FOBT/FIT and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Visual inspection of the oral cavity has been widely used for screening oral cancer. The target population for oral cancer screening includes those aged 30 years and older who use tobacco and/or alcohol. Advantages of visual inspection include its feasibility, safety, acceptability, accuracy to detect oral precancerous and cancerous lesions, and efficacy and cost-effectiveness in reducing oral cancer mortality. Pap smear is a screening test for cervical cancer. Screening should begin at age 21 years. For women aged between 21-29 years, screening should be done every 3 years with Pap smear examination. For women aged between 30-65 years, screening should be done every 5 years with both HPV and the Pap co-test. Using mammography as a routine screening tool in women has been reported to reduce mortality from breast cancer. The United Kingdom recently established an independent expert panel to estimate the benefits and harms associated with screening women in its national screening program. The panel estimated that breast screening resulted in a 20% reduction in breast cancer mortality. The panel also noted over-diagnosis of breast carcinoma but concluded that breast screening confers significant benefits and should be continued.</li><li>\u27a4 Screening for common cancers using relatively non-invasive tests is expected to lead to early diagnosis, allow more conservative surgical therapies with decreased morbidity, and potentially improve surgical cure rates and overall survival rates.</li><li>\u27a4 Current American Cancer Society guidelines advocate colon cancer screening for the average-risk population beginning at age 50 years.

D. 50 Hz</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 This is the frequency typically used for tetanic stimulation in neuromuscular monitoring. A stimulation of 50 Hz for 5 seconds results in a tetanic contraction. If the patient is under profound neuromuscular blockade, no contraction will be observed. If there's some recovery from blockade, a contraction will be noted but may be weaker than in a patient with no blockade. Fade during or after tetanic stimulation can indicate incomplete recovery from blockade.</li><li>\u2022 Tetanic stimulation is a method used in neuromuscular monitoring to assess the degree of neuromuscular blockade in patients who have received neuromuscular blocking agents (often used during surgeries to produce muscle paralysis). Tetanic stimulation involves giving a high-frequency series of electrical impulses to a peripheral nerve to cause sustained muscle contraction. The response to tetanic stimulation can help determine the depth of neuromuscular blockade and the presence of fade.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 0.2 Hz : This frequency is more representative of a \"single twitch\" stimulation, where one stimulus is delivered every 5 seconds. It is used to monitor the initial onset and the later stages of recovery from neuromuscular blockade.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 0.2 Hz</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 2 Hz : This refers to a train-of-four (TOF) stimulation where four stimuli are given at a frequency of 2 Hz (2 stimuli per second). It's a common method of monitoring neuromuscular blockade, especially when assessing for residual blockade. A fading response in the TOF is indicative of neuromuscular blockade.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 2 Hz</li><li>\u2022 Option C. 20 Hz : This isn't a standard frequency for neuromuscular monitoring.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. 20 Hz</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective :</li><li>\u27a4 The frequency of tetanic stimulation used in neuromuscular monitoring is typically 50 Hz.</li><li>\u27a4 PATTERN OF NERVE STIMULATION:</li><li>\u27a4 PATTERN OF NERVE STIMULATION:</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Miller\u2019s Anesthesia, 9 th Ed.

Its sweet smell makes it suitable for inhalational induction, especially in pediatric patients and others who might find pungent agents unpleasant. Sevoflurane also provides a smooth transition for endotracheal intubation due to its bronchodilatory effects and stable hemodynamic profile.

The gland requires a substantial blood supply due to its high metabolic activity, especially when it's actively producing thyroid hormones. The inferior thyroid artery enters the thyroid gland at its posterior aspect and supplies the majority of the gland, especially its inferior portion. Parathyroid : The parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. There are usually four parathyroid glands: two superior and two inferior. The inferior parathyroid glands are typically supplied by the inferior thyroid artery. The blood supply to these glands is crucial because they produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), which plays a vital role in calcium homeostasis. Esophagus : The esophagus , especially its cervical portion, may receive some blood supply from the branches of the inferior thyroid artery. However, it's essential to note that the primary blood supply to the esophagus comes from the esophageal branches of various arteries along its length, such as the aorta and the left gastric artery. Thymus : While the inferior thyroid artery is not a primary source of blood supply for the thymus, there can be some anastomotic connections between the vessels supplying these structures in the anterior mediastinum.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. C. 1 only</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 1. CO2 embolism : During laparoscopic procedures, CO2 is used to insufflate the abdomen, creating a pneumoperitoneum. This allows for better visualization and manipulation of the internal structures. If there's a vascular injury, especially to a large vein, CO2 can enter the circulation and cause an embolism. This can lead to sudden cardiovascular collapse and a sharp drop in EtCO2, as observed in the scenario. Also, a sudden drop in oxygen saturation (SpO2) can occur due to the embolism obstructing the pulmonary vasculature. The significant drop in EtCO2, in this case, is indicative of a CO2 embolism.</li><li>\u2022 1. CO2 embolism</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 2. Severe bronchospasm : Bronchospasm would lead to an increase in peak airway pressure, which wasn't seen in this scenario (the peak airway pressure was 18 cm of H2O, which is within the normal range). Moreover, EtCO2 would generally be elevated in bronchospasm due to retention of CO2, not decreased as seen in the scenario.</li><li>\u2022 2. Severe bronchospasm</li><li>\u2022 3. Pneumothorax : A pneumothorax could cause a drop in SpO2 and blood pressure. However, the EtCO2 drop to 8 mm Hg in the setting of laparoscopic surgery more specifically suggests a CO2 embolism. Additionally, one would expect an increase in peak airway pressures with a tension pneumothorax.</li><li>\u2022 3. Pneumothorax</li><li>\u2022 4. Single bronchus intubation : If the endotracheal tube is advanced too far and intubates a single bronchus, it would lead to ventilation of one lung only. This can cause a decrease in SpO2, but the sudden drop in EtCO2 as seen in the scenario isn't typical for single bronchus intubation.</li><li>\u2022 4.
