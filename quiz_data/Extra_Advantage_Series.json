MVP is a frequent finding in patients with heritable disorders of connective tissue, including Marfan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Ehlers- Danlos syndrome. The posterior mitral leaflet is usually more affected than the anterior, and the mitral valve annulus is often dilated. MVP is more common in women and occurs most frequently between the ages of 15 and 30 years; the clinical course is most often benign. A frequent physical examination finding is the mid or late (nonejection) systolic click, followed by a highpitched, mid-late systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur and is heard best at the apex. Radiation of the murmur will depend on the involved leaflet. With posterior leaflet prolapse, the jet of mitral regurgitation (MR) is directed anteriorly and the murmur will radiate to the base of the heart. With anterior leaflet involvement, the jet of MR is directed posteriorly and the murmur will radiate to the axilla and back. The click and murmur occur earlier with standing, during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver, and with any intervention that decreases left ventricular (LV) volume (preload), exaggerating the propensity of mitral leaflet prolapse. Conversely, squatting and isometric exercises, which increase LV volume, diminish MVP; the click-murmur omplex is delayed, moves away from S1, and may even disappear.</li><li>\u2022 In most patients with MVP, the cause is unknown.</li><li>\u2022 MVP is a frequent finding in patients with heritable disorders of connective tissue, including Marfan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Ehlers- Danlos syndrome.</li><li>\u2022 The posterior mitral leaflet is usually more affected than the anterior, and the mitral valve annulus is often dilated.</li><li>\u2022 MVP is more common in women and occurs most frequently between the ages of 15 and 30 years; the clinical course is most often benign.</li><li>\u2022 A frequent physical examination finding is the mid or late (nonejection) systolic click, followed by a highpitched, mid-late systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur and is heard best at the apex.</li><li>\u2022 Radiation of the murmur will depend on the involved leaflet.

Livedo reticularis is a subtle, lacy network of faintly pink or bluish red vessels, usually seen on the lower legs due to altered blood flow through cutaneous vessels. This CT angiogram shows extensive atherosclerotic disease scattered throughout the central vasculature. Plaques are heavily concentrated in the proximal descending aorta, causing visible narrowing. Aortic atherosclerotic plaques are a significant source of systemic emboli. Emboli from aortic plaques may be thrombotic or atheromatous. Thromboembolism occurs when an atherosclerotic plaque becomes unstable and ruptures, exposing thrombogenic factors that lead to clot formation. Thromboemboli that arise from plaques tend to be single and lodge in small or medium arteries, causing transient ischemic attack, stroke, kidney infarction, intestinal ischemia, or limb ischemia. Atheroemboli result from release of fragments of plaque (such as cholesterol crystals) that tend to lodge more diffusely in smaller arterial beds in different organs; they may result in conditions such as livedo reticularis, \u201cblue toe\u201d syndrome, and retinal or kidney ischemia.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Acts on bone, kidney, and indirectly on the intestine to \u2191 serum calcium. Regulation: PTH release inhibited by calcium and vitamin D (and vice versa). Continuous exposure to high PTH leads to bone resorption, while intermittent administration increases bone mass. PTH acts on osteoblasts, which indirectly activate osteoclasts (via RANKL) for bone resorption. PTH assays should ideally measure only the full-length, biologically active form. PTHrP Structure and Physiology: PTHrP and PTH share structural and functional homology and bind to PTHR1 (activating mutations of PTHR1 results in Jansen\u2019s disease \u2013 hypercalcemia, short limbed dwarfism and cystic bone lesions with undetectable PTH) It is produced in many cell types and mainly acts as a paracrine factor. PTHrP is important for bone development and other functions. PTHrP and its role in calcium homeostasis is limited to disease states (especially in humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM). Calcitonin: \u2193 bone resorption and \u2191 renal calcium clearance. It is of limited physiologic significance in humans. Used as a tumor marker (MTC) and treatment for hypercalcemia and Paget's disease.
