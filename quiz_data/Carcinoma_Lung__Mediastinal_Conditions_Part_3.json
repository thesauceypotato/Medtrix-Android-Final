      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hamartoma Benign tumors of the lung are uncommon and account for fewer than 15% of solitary lesions seen on chest radiographs. A peripheral tumor usually causes no symptoms until it is large; a central tumor may present with haemoptysis and signs of bronchial obstruction while still small. A tumor is likely to be benign if it has not increased in size on chest radiographs for more than 2 years or it has some degree of calcification; however, a tissue diagnosis is usually pursued. Most benign nodules are granulomas (tuberculosis or histoplasmosis). The most common benign tumor is a hamartoma , a developmental abnormality containing mesothelial and endothelial elements. Diagnosis (and definitive treatment) is achieved by excision of the lesion. Any of the mesodermal elements of the lung may form mesodermal tumors ( chondroma, lipoma, leiomyoma ). Deposits of amyloid may have a similar radiographic appearance to a nodule (pseudotumor).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Pulmonary Hamartoma Pulmonary Hamartoma is the most common benign tumor of the lung , and it is characterized by overgrowth of cartilage . It typically occurs in males aged between 40-60 years and grows slowly in the lung, usually in the peripheral region . The diagnosis of this condition is usually made through a chest X-ray which shows a characteristic popcorn calcification or a CT scan which shows a coin lesion . The definitive treatment for pulmonary hamartoma is the surgical excision of the lesion.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Chondroma : A chondroma is a benign tumor composed of cartilage. It is a rare tumor of the lung and may cause symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. The definitive treatment for chondroma is surgical resection. Option: C. Lipoma : A lipoma is a benign tumor composed of adipose tissue (fat). Lipomas are very rare in the lung and may be asymptomatic or cause symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. The definitive treatment for lipoma is surgical resection. Option: D. Leiomyoma : A leiomyoma is a benign tumor composed of smooth muscle tissue. Leiomyomas are rare in the lung and may cause symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. The definitive treatment for leiomyoma is surgical resection</p>\n<p></p>",

The TNM staging system provides prognostic information. Tumors graded up to T3, N1, M0 have improved prognosis when treated surgically. Accurate staging is necessary before resection. For higher stage tumors , a multi- or trimodality approach is offered. Non-tumor factors determine appropriate treatment. Incurable disease is treated palliatively to maximize quality of life.</p>\n<p></p>",
