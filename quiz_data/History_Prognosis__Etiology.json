Intellectual insight : Admission of illness and recognition that symptoms or failures in social adjustment are due to irrational feelings or disturbances, without applying that knowledge to future experiences True emotional insight : Emotional awareness of the motives and feelings within, of the underlying meaning of symptoms; does the awareness lead to changes in personality and future behavior; openness to new ideas and concepts about self and the important persons in his or her life.</p>\n<p></p>",

A patient with a schizotypal personality disorder may be suspicious, anxious, and have ideas of reference (e.g., witnessing a traffic accident makes the patient believe that this event has a personal significance). However, the anxiety in schizotypal personality disorder is usually provoked by social interactions rather than a fear of bodily harm. Moreover, other features of this personality disorder such as few friends, oddly dressed appearance, magical beliefs that are inconsistent with cultural norms, and/or a restricted affect are not present in this patient.

Although paranoid personality disorder is also characterized by excessive suspicions and paranoia, such suspicion derives from a distrust of others rather than long-standing bizarre delusions such as aliens stealing thoughts. Additionally, personality disorders are stable over time , whereas this patient's symptoms started only 7 months ago. Personality disorders start in adolescence. Option: D.

The prodrome of psychosis may present with obsessional symptoms. Often it is difficult to differentiate OCD from schizophrenia in such presentations. But the useful pointers are: Ego-dystonic nature of obsessions may not be prominent in psychosis The insight that the thoughts are one\u2019s own may not be seen in psychosis Resistance to the obsessions may be conspicuously absent; and The content of obsessions may be bizarre , instead of the usual themes of safety, contamination, sex, violence, religion, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect Options:- Option: B . Depression- DSM-5 Criteria to diagnose depression : Two or more episodes of major depression diagnosed by the following: Five or more of the following symptoms have been present most of the time for at least 2 weeks: Depressed mood Anhedonia Significant weight change or change in appetite Insomnia or hypersomnia Psychomotor agitation or retardation Fatigue or loss of energy Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt Decreased ability to concentrate or indecisiveness Thoughts of death or suicidal ideationThere has never been a manic, hypomanic, or mixed episode. Option: C . Schizotypal disorder- A schizotypal personality disorder is a cluster A personality disorder . It usually manifests with eccentric behavior , and affected individuals have odd beliefs or magical thinking that are inconsistent with cultural norms. This woman's social anxiety, inappropriate affect, and lack of close friends are also common features of this disorder. Option: D . Delusional disorder- Delusional disorder is a type of psychotic disorder. Its main symptom is the presence of one or more delusions. A delusion is an unshakable belief in something that's untrue. The belief isn't a part of the person's culture or subculture, and almost everyone else knows this belief to be false.</p>\n<p></p>",

GABA - The inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based on the finding that some patients with schizophrenia have a loss of GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus .
