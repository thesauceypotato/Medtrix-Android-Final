It almost always follows a penetrating injury . Wounds in the ciliary region ( the so-called dangerous zone) are more prone to it. Wounds with the incarceration of the iris, ciliary body, or lens capsule are more vulnerable. It is more common in children than in adults. It does not occur when actual suppuration develops in the injured eye. Pathogenesis : Various theories have been put forward. The most accepted one is an allergic theory, which postulates that the uveal pigment acts as an allergen and excites plastic uveitis in the sound eye. Pathology It is characteristic of granulomatous uveitis, e. there is \u2022 Nodular aggregation of lymphocytes, plasma cells, epithelioid cells, and giant cells scattered throughout the uveal tract. \u2022 Dalen-Fuchs' nodules are formed due to the proliferation of the pigment epithelium (of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid) associated with invasion by the lymphocytes and epithelioid cells . \u2022 Sympathetic perivasculitis . The retina shows perivascular cellular infiltration. Clinical features Exciting (injured) eye. It shows clinical features of persistent low-grade plastic uveitis, which include ciliary congestion, lacrimation, and tenderness. Keratic precipitates may be present at the back of the cornea ( dangerous sign ). Sympathizing (sound) eye. It is usually involved after 4-8 weeks of injury in the other eye . The earliest reported case is after 9 days of injury . Sympathetic ophthalmitis, almost always, manifests as acute plastic iridocyclitis . Rarely it may manifest as neuro retinitis or choroiditis. Clinical features of iridocyclitis in the sympathetic eye can be divided into two stages : Prodromal stage. Sensitivity to light (photophobia) and transient indistinctness of near objects (due to weakening of accommodation) are the earliest symptoms. In this stage, the first sign may be the presence of retrolental flare and cells or the presence of a few keratic precipitates (KPs) on the back of the cornea. Other signs include mild ciliary congestion, slight tenderness of the globe, fine vitreous haze, and disc edema which is seen occasionally. Fully-developed stage . It is clinically characterized by typical signs and symptoms consistent with acute plastic iridocyclitis</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
