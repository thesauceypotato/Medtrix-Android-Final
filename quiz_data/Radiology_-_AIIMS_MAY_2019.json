Love and bailey has very categorically mentioned, THYMOMA as the most common mediastinal mass accounting for around 25% of the cases and hence the answer</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Clinical Features Local mass effects causing chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, cough, and SVC. Myasthenia gravis is the most common syndromes. Other syndromes are: Pure white blood cell aplasia, pure red blood cell aplasia, aplastic anemia, Cushing syndrome, Hypergammaglobulinemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, dermatomyositis, SLE, RA, megaesophagus, and granulomatous myocarditis. Diagnosis IOC: CT Scan Histological study is the definitive study Cytokeratin is a good marker, which distinguish Thymomas from lymphomas. Treatment TOC: Total thymectomy performed through median sternotomy Thymomas size > 5 cm with evidence of invasion: Chemotherapy followed by surgical exploration with the goal of complete resection and postoperative (adjuvant) radiation therapy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B. Neurogenic tumors ; It is located in the posterior mediastinum. Option C. Vascular lesions ; Vascular lesions are relatively common abnormalities of the skin and underlying tissues, more commonly known as birthmarks. There are three major categories of vascular lesions: Hemangiomas, Vascular Malformations, and Pyogenic Granulomas. Option D. Germ cell tumor ; erm cell tumors are growths of cells that form from reproductive cells. The tumors may be cancerous or not cancerous. Most germ cell tumors occur in the testicles or the ovaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Neurogenic Tumors It is located in the posterior mediastinum. It originated from the sympathetic ganglia (neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioma), the intercostal nerves (neurosarcoma, neurilemoma, and neurofibroma), and the paraganglia cells (paraganglioma). Neurilemoma or schwannoma is the most common neurogenic tumor; which originates from perineural Schwann cells Pancoast syndrome and Horner syndrome occurs due to involvement of the brachial and the cervical sympathetic chain. Dumbbell tumors: 10% of neurogenic tumors have extensions into the spinal column.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
