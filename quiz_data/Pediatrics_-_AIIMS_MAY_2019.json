PSGN is a kidney disease (glomerulonephritis) that can develop after infections caused by bacteria called group A Streptococcus (group A strep).

OPTION D: Infection-associated glomerulonephritis is a broad term that encompasses various types of glomerulonephritis that can occur secondary to infections.

The term congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) encompasses a group of autosomal recessive disorders, each of which involves a deficiency of an enzyme involved in the synthesis of cortisol, aldosterone, or both. The diagnosis of CAH depends on the demonstration of inadequate production of cortisol, aldosterone, or both in the presence of accumulation of excess concentrations of precursor hormones. Management guidelines of CAH include: Glucocorticoid replacement is the cornerstone of replacement therapy in CAH. The drug of choice in children is hydrocortisone. This drug should be administered in tablet form which can be crushed and mixed with milk or liquid as fresh preparation before administration. Other potent forms of glucocorticoids like prednisolone and dexamethasone are not recommended for use in early childhood years but can be used in postpubertal and adult patients Mineralocorticoid replacement is encouraged in CAH with salt-wasting; in infants, mineralocorticoid replacement (usually with fludrocortisones) and sodium supplementation are encouraged.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH): CAH is a group of autosomal recessive disorders affecting steroid synthesis. The most common form of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. CAH leads to deficiencies in adrenal hormones and excess steroid precursors. CAH has a spectrum of forms, including salt-wasting, simple virilizing, and non-classic forms. Diagnosis involves measuring elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Management includes lifelong steroid replacement therapy. Hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone are used for salt-wasting and virilizing forms. Synthetic glucocorticoids may be used after growth and pubertal development. Other enzyme deficiencies account for a minority of CAH cases. Specific management is required for these less common forms.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

However it is noteworthy that diarrhea in neonates can often be a symptom presentation of sepsis; and therefore a high degree of suspicion should be kept in mind and antibiotics started if sepsis confirmed.
