They are ash-grey or light-brown in color, have a shiny surface, and are covered with radiating silky fibers. They are tough, challenging, and difficult to pulverize. The bark, wood, and leaves contain brucine but no strychnine. Strychnine is used as a respiratory stimulant, rodenticide, and for killing stray dogs.</p>\n<p></p>",

Seeds are variable, smooth, flattened-oval, mottled, light and dark brown, white with yellow-brown or gray markings, or black or red. They are of two\u2014sizes, big and small. The tiny seeds are about .2 cm. long and 0.8 cm. broad and resemble croton seeds. The seeds resemble those of Croton</p>\n<p></p>",

Nicotine-like stimulation is followed by paralysis of postganglionic and somatic motor nerves, causing twitching of the eyelids, tongue, and facial muscles, followed by neuromuscular block and paralysis. Nicotinic signs and symptoms result from the accumulation of acetylcholine at the endings of motor nerves to skeletal muscles and autonomic ganglia. Central nervous system stimulation followed by depression causes headaches, giddiness, restlessness, apprehension, tremors, ataxia, insomnia, coma, and death.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Intake of indigestible plant materials Abezoar is an indigestible mass of material found in the gastrointestinal tract, such as hair, food, seeds, or another ingested substance. A phytobezoar, the most common type of bezoar, is composed of indigestible fruit and vegetable fibers, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, or tannins. Most phytobezoars occur in patients with impaired gastric motility or digestion, usually following gastric surgery (such as a Billroth I or II gastrectomy) or as a consequence of poor motility in patients with diabetic gastroparesis, mixed connective tissue disease, or hypothyroidism. Impaired gastric peristalsis, low gastric acidity, and loss of normal pyloric function can contribute to phytobezoar formation. Patients with phytobezoars may experience epigastric pain or discomfort, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, weight loss, diarrhea, dysphagia, or upper gastrointestinal ulcerations and hemorrhage</p>\n<p></p>",
