Infectious mononucleosis is characterized by fever, sore throat, generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and the appearance in the blood of atypical activated T lymphocytes (mononucleosis cells). Some people develop hepatitis, meningoencephalitis, and pneumonitis. Infectious mononucleosis occurs principally in late adolescents or young adults among upper socioeconomic classes in higher-income nations. In the rest of the world, primary infection with EBV occurs in childhood and is usually asymptomatic. EBV is transmitted by close human contact, frequently through saliva during kissing . It is not known whether the source of the virus is B cells, oropharyngeal epithelial cells, or both . EBV infects B cells and possibly epithelial cells of the oropharynx. It has been hypothesized that EBV initially infects oropharyngeal epithelial cells and then spreads to underlying lymphoid tissue (tonsils and adenoids), where mature B cells are infected. An EBV envelope glycoprotein binds CD21 (CR2) , the receptor for the C3d component of complement , which is present in B cells .' DOWNEY cells are atypical CD8+ T lymphocytes that are characteristic of infectious mononucleosis . DOWNY cells exhibit both suppressor & cytotoxic functions that develop in response to the infected B lymphocytes.
