      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Ca larynx Laryngeal carcinoma is an indication for high tracheostomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Tracheostomy is making an opening in the anterior wall of trachea and converting it into a stoma on the skin surface. Sometimes, the term tracheotomy has been interchangeably used but the latter actually means opening the trachea, which is a step in the tracheostomy operation. Types of Tracheostomy Emergency tracheostomy Elective or tranquil tracheostomy Permanent tracheostomy Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy Mini tracheostomy (cricothyroidotomy) It has also been divided into high, mid or low. A high tracheostomy is done above the level of thyroid isthmus (isthmus lies against II, III and IV tracheal rings). It violates the first ring of trachea. Tracheostomy  at  this site can cause perichondritis of the cricoid cartilage and subglottic stenosis and is always avoided. Only indication for high tracheostomy is carcinoma of larynx because in such cases, total larynx anyway would ultimately be removed and a fresh tracheostome made in a clean area lower down. A mid tracheostomy is the preferred one and is done through the II or III ring and would entail division of the thyroid isthmus or its retraction upwards or downwards to expose this part of trachea. A low tracheostomy is done below the level of isthmus. Trachea is deep at this level and close to several large vessels; also there are difficulties with tracheostomy tube which impinges on suprasternal notch.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A- In acute diphtheria mid tracheostomy may be done. OPTION C- In papillomatosis low tracheostomy may be done. OPTION D- In vocal polyp tracheostomy may not be needed at all.</p>\n<p></p>",

Such an implant is needed when CN VIII has been severed in surgery of vestibular schwannoma. In these cases, cochlear implants are obviously of no use. In unilateral acoustic neuroma, ABI is not necessary as hearing is possible from the contralateral side but in bilateral acoustic neuromas as in NF2, rehabilitation is required by ABI. Brainstem implant is similar to \u2018Nucleus\u2019 multichannel cochlear implant except that the multielectrode array is attached to a Dacron mesh, which is placed on the brainstem. Receiver/ stimulator has a removable magnet so that MRI can be safely performed in such cases if need arises.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>ABIs help in communication, awareness and recognition of environmental sounds; however, they are not as efficient as multichannel cochlear implants. Only limited numbers of such implants have been performed in the world and are under constant technological developments.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Mucor Most common fungus causing orbital cellulitis in diabetic patients is mucor.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mucormycosis: It is a fungal infection of nose and paranasal sinuses which may prove rapidly fatal. It is seen in uncontrolled diabetics or in those taking immunosuppressive drugs. From the nose and sinuses, infection can spread to orbit, cribriform plate, meninges and brain. The rapid destruction associated with the disease is due to affinity of the fungus to invade the arteries and cause endothelial damage and thrombosis. Typical finding is the presence of a black necrotic mass filling the nasal cavity and eroding the septum and hard palate. Special stains help to identify the fungus in tissue sections. Treatment is by amphotericin B and surgical debridement of the affected tissues and control of underlying predisposing cause. Mucormycosis must be suspected in all diabetic patients, particularly those in ketoacidosis, and any debilitated or immunocompromised individual with multiple cranial nerve palsies with or without proptosis. It requires immediate hospitalization because this is a rapidly progressive and possibly life-threatening disease and the treatment is complex both medical and surgical and must be conducted in a multidisciplinary team.</p>\n<p></p>",
