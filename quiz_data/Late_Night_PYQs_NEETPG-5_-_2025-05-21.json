B) Zenker's Diverticulum</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Zenker's diverticulum is a pulsion diverticulum where pharyngeal mucosa herniates through Killian's dehiscence (a weak area between two parts of the inferior constrictor muscle). This condition typically affects patients over 60 years of age, matching our elderly patient's demographic. The classic symptoms include dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), regurgitation of undigested food (especially at night when recumbent), halitosis (bad breath), and cough with aspiration pneumonia (explaining the bilateral lung crepitations).</li><li>\u2022 Visual Support</li><li>\u2022 Zenker's diverticulum occurs when herniation of pouch starts in the midline. It is at first behind the esophagus and then comes to lie on its left. The mouth of the sac is wider than the opening of esophagus, so food preferentially enters the sac.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Schatzki Ring: This is a narrow ring of tissue at the lower end of the esophagus and would not cause regurgitation of undigested food or aspiration pneumonia. It typically presents with intermittent dysphagia for solids only, not the constellation of symptoms described.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Schatzki Ring:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Corkscrew Esophagus: This is a motility disorder (diffuse esophageal spasm) characterized by non-peristaltic contractions. While it can cause dysphagia, it does not lead to regurgitation of undigested food, halitosis, or aspiration pneumonia as seen in this patient.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Corkscrew Esophagus:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Plummer-Vinson Syndrome: This condition is characterized by hypochromic microcytic anemia, dysphagia, and esophageal webs. It typically affects women in their 40s and 50s, not elderly men. It is not associated with regurgitation, halitosis, or aspiration pneumonia.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Plummer-Vinson Syndrome:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Zenker's diverticulum should be suspected in elderly patients presenting with dysphagia, regurgitation of undigested food, halitosis, and respiratory complications due to aspiration, as the pouch traps food that can later be regurgitated and aspirated.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Pathogenesis: Infants are inoculated by personnel carrying S. aureus and transmit the bacteria to the breastfeeding mother through the nasopharynx. Risk Factors: Maternal age > 30 years Maternal fatigue and stress Sores and cracked nipples History of mastitis after a previous pregnancy Breast engorgement, blocked lactiferous ducts, and milk stasis Etiology: Most cases of mastitis result from infection with S. aureus. Other organisms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and other bacteria such as Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas picetti, and Haemophilus influenzae. Diagnosis: Maternal fever (100.4\u00b0F or higher) Chills, myalgia, malaise Breast tenderness with associated erythema, usually unilateral Segmental erythema on the breast, typically in the upper, outer quadrant, with variable degrees of induration Palpable, fluctuant mass suggesting a breast abscess should prompt immediate breast ultrasound Milk may be expressed for leukocyte and bacterial counts, though this is not recommended for diagnosing uncomplicated mastitis Treatment: Antibiotics: Dicloxacillin, amoxicillin, or nafcillin, or a first-generation cephalosporin Penicillin Allergy: Erythromycin or vancomycin Duration: Antibiotic therapy should be continued for 10 to 14 days to avoid resistant organisms Breastfeeding: Women should continue breastfeeding, initiating feeds on the unaffected breast and changing the infant's position at different feeds to prevent the development of a breast abscess Symptomatic Relief: Analgesics like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, increased fluid intake, adequate nutrition, cold or warm compresses, and breast support should be provided</li><li>\u2022 Definition: Mastitis is an inflammatory condition of the breast that may occur in breastfeeding women during the puerperium.</li><li>\u2022 Definition:</li><li>\u2022 Pathogenesis: Infants are inoculated by personnel carrying S. aureus and transmit the bacteria to the breastfeeding mother through the nasopharynx.</li><li>\u2022 Pathogenesis:</li><li>\u2022 Risk Factors: Maternal age > 30 years Maternal fatigue and stress Sores and cracked nipples History of mastitis after a previous pregnancy Breast engorgement, blocked lactiferous ducts, and milk stasis</li><li>\u2022 Risk Factors:</li><li>\u2022 Maternal age > 30 years Maternal fatigue and stress Sores and cracked nipples History of mastitis after a previous pregnancy Breast engorgement, blocked lactiferous ducts, and milk stasis</li><li>\u2022 Maternal age > 30 years</li><li>\u2022 Maternal fatigue and stress</li><li>\u2022 Sores and cracked nipples</li><li>\u2022 History of mastitis after a previous pregnancy</li><li>\u2022 Breast engorgement, blocked lactiferous ducts, and milk stasis</li><li>\u2022 Etiology: Most cases of mastitis result from infection with S. aureus.
