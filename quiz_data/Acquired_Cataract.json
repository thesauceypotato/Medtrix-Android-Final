The features in the clinical vignette suggest that the patient is suffering from cataracts and symptoms suggesting \"Second sight\" (able to read a newspaper without his glasses) help to conclude that it is a case of a Nuclear Type Of Cataract. Option: B . In this type of Cataract, there is a tendency for the Nuclear fibres to harden/sclerosed Option : C. As it progresses the nucleus becomes dark brown or red because of pigmented protein deposition . These proteins are derived from tryptophan due to exposure to sunlight.</p>\n<p></p>",

The Peripheral fibres in the cortical Cataract are affected while it is spared in Nuclear Cataract and in the same way central fibres are hardened in nuclear Cataracts while spared in cortical variants. A cortical variant of senile cataract occurs due to Overhydration and accumulation of fluid Nuclear Type is due to dehydration There is a decrease in the Refractive index in the cortical Type while an increase in the Nuclear variant The cortical type shows progressive Hypermetropia while the Nuclear variant shows progressive Myopia. Hence only the Nuclear Type Of Cataract shows the feature of Second sight and not the cortical variant.</p>\n<p></p>",

The above Clinical vignette where the patient complains that he can see many images in the same eye is called Uniocular Polyopia.

The fluid starts to accumulate in the lens and in this early stage, it accumulates as water droplets scattered in the content of the lens. Hence there is irregular refraction due to different Refractive indices in each region of the lens.</p>\n<p></p>",
