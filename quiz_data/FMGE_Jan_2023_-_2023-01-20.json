C)\u00a0Vitamin A</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 Xerophthalmia, including conjunctival xerosis (dryness of the conjunctiva), is a hallmark sign of Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is essential for the maintenance of healthy epithelial tissues, including the conjunctiva and cornea of the eye. It also plays a crucial role in vision, particularly in low-light conditions. Deficiency can lead to dryness of the eye, night blindness, and in severe cases, can progress to keratomalacia and blindness.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Vitamin B1: Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) deficiency primarily affects the nervous system and can lead to conditions like beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. It does not typically manifest as xerophthalmia or conjunctival xerosis, which are eye-related conditions.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Vitamin B1:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Vitamin B3: Vitamin B3 (Niacin) deficiency leads to pellagra, which is characterized by the \"three Ds\": dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. While dermatitis can affect the skin around the eyes, it does not cause xerophthalmia, which is specifically related to dryness of the conjunctiva and cornea.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Vitamin B3:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Vitamin D: Vitamin D deficiency is primarily associated with bone diseases like rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults due to its role in calcium and phosphate metabolism. It is not typically associated with xerophthalmia or eye disorders.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

In the intestine, a specific cytidine in the mRNA for Apo B is deaminated to uridine, which changes the codon from one encoding amino acid to a stop codon. This results in the production of a shorter protein, Apo B 48. In the liver, this editing does not occur, so the full-length Apo B 100 is produced.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. DNA Gene Mutation in Intestines: Incorrect. The difference between Apo B 48 and Apo B 100 is not due to a DNA gene mutation specific to the intestines.

DNA Gene Mutation in Intestines:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Point Mutation in Liver: Incorrect.

A)\u00a0Galactosemia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Galactosemia is a rare genetic disorder where the body cannot properly metabolize galactose, a sugar present in breast milk and many other foods. Infants with galactosemia are unable to break down galactose and its accumulation can lead to severe complications. Therefore, breastfeeding is an absolute contraindication for infants with galactosemia, and they require a special galactose-free formula.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. HIV: This option is incorrect. While HIV can be transmitted through breast milk, the transmission risk can be significantly reduced by antiretroviral therapy (ART) and other precautions. In certain situations, such as in resource-limited settings where safe alternatives to breastfeeding are not available, the benefits of breastfeeding may outweigh the risks of HIV transmission. However, in areas where safe and affordable alternatives are accessible, avoiding breastfeeding is generally recommended for infants born to HIV-positive mothers.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.</li><li>\u2022 HIV:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Hepatitis B: This option is incorrect. Breastfeeding is not an absolute contraindication for infants born to mothers with hepatitis B. Transmission of hepatitis B through breast milk is considered low, and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that infants receive the hepatitis B vaccine and a dose of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth to prevent transmission. Breastfeeding can generally continue in these cases.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.</li><li>\u2022 Hepatitis B:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Cytomegalovirus infection: This option is incorrect. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can be transmitted through breast milk, but the transmission risk can be reduced. In most cases, breastfeeding is not an absolute contraindication for infants with CMV infection. Precautions such as pasteurization of breast milk or using frozen breast milk from before the infection occurred can be taken to reduce the risk of transmission.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.</li><li>\u2022 Cytomegalovirus infection:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The question aims to identify conditions where breastfeeding is absolutely contraindicated. Understanding absolute contraindications for breastfeeding is crucial for ensuring the safety and health of both the neonate and the mother. In certain medical conditions, breastfeeding can pose significant health risks to the infant, necessitating alternative feeding methods.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

History of 2 or more Lower Segment Cesarean Sections (LSCS): Multiple C-sections also increase the risk of uterine rupture. Malpresentation: Includes breech, transverse, or any non-cephalic presentation of the fetus. Obstructed labor: Labor that does not progress due to physical obstruction. Fetal distress: Signs that the fetus is not well, such as abnormal heart rate patterns.

It is located deep within the cerebral hemispheres and separates the caudate nucleus and the thalamus from the putamen and the globus pallidus. The internal capsule contains axon tracts that serve as major pathways for communication between different parts of the brain, including the cortex, thalamus, and various subcortical nuclei.</li><li>\u2022 The internal capsule is often subdivided into three parts: the anterior limb, genu (knee), and posterior limb. Each limb contains different types of nerve fibers that transmit motor, sensory, and other information between the cerebral cortex and other brain regions.</li><li>\u2022 The internal capsule consists of several parts and is V-shaped when cut horizontally, in a transverse plane.</li><li>\u2022 the bend in the V is called the genu the anterior limb or crus anterius is the part in front of the genu, between the head of the caudate nucleus and the lenticular nucleus the posterior limb or crus posterius is the part behind the genu, between the thalamus and lenticular nucleus the retrolenticular portion is caudal to the lenticular nucleus and carries the optic radiation (from medial part of lateral geniculate nucleus) also known as the geniculocalcarine tract. The fiber from lateral part of lateral geniculate nucleus is carried through the retrolenticular portion. the sublenticular portion is beneath the lenticular nucleus and are tracts involved in the auditory pathway from the medial geniculate nucleus to the primary auditory cortex (Brodmann areas 41 and 42)</li><li>\u2022 the bend in the V is called the genu</li><li>\u2022 the anterior limb or crus anterius is the part in front of the genu, between the head of the caudate nucleus and the lenticular nucleus</li><li>\u2022 anterior limb or crus anterius</li><li>\u2022 the posterior limb or crus posterius is the part behind the genu, between the thalamus and lenticular nucleus</li><li>\u2022 posterior limb or crus posterius</li><li>\u2022 the retrolenticular portion is caudal to the lenticular nucleus and carries the optic radiation (from medial part of lateral geniculate nucleus) also known as the geniculocalcarine tract.

External Capsule : The external capsule is another white matter structure located in the brain, but it is less well-known than the internal capsule. It is located lateral to the putamen and globus pallidus and is considered part of the deep gray matter of the basal ganglia. The exact function and significance of the external capsule are still a subject of ongoing research, and its role in brain function is not as well-defined as that of the internal capsule.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. External Capsule</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Caudate Lobe : The caudate lobe, also known as the caudate nucleus, is a part of the basal ganglia. It is a C-shaped structure located within each cerebral hemisphere. The caudate nucleus is involved in various functions, including motor control, cognition, and emotional processing. It is interconnected with other basal ganglia nuclei and plays a role in regulating movement. Lesions or dysfunction in the caudate nucleus can lead to movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Caudate Lobe</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Globus Pallidus : The globus pallidus is another component of the basal ganglia. It is divided into two segments: the external segment (GPe) and the internal segment (GPi). The globus pallidus is involved in motor control and plays a role in modulating motor signals sent from the cortex to the thalamus. Dysfunctions of the globus pallidus can result in movement disorders, including dystonia and Parkinson's disease.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Globus Pallidus</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The internal capsule's strategic location and structure facilitate critical communication pathways in the brain, making its integrity vital for normal motor and sensory functions.

Tyrosine, an amino acid, is the primary precursor for melanin synthesis.

While phenylalanine itself is not directly used in melanin synthesis, it is important to note that phenylalanine can be converted into tyrosine in the body.

This line is also known as the intertubercular plane or Tuffier's line, which is anatomically aligned with the upper border of the L5 vertebra. The intertubercular plane is significant in clinical settings as it passes through the highest points of the iliac crests, located at the L4-L5 intervertebral disc space. This reference point is crucial for procedures such as spinal anesthesia and lumbar punctures, where accurate identification of vertebral levels is essential.</li><li>\u2022 Clinical Significance:</li><li>\u2022 Clinical Significance:</li><li>\u2022 It serves as a reference point for various medical procedures, particularly those involving the lumbar spine, spinal anesthesia, and the placement of lumbar punctures (spinal taps). When performing a lumbar puncture, healthcare providers often use the intertubercular plane as a landmark to identify the appropriate level for inserting the needle into the subarachnoid space. Tuffier's Line: The term \"Tuffier's line\" is often used interchangeably with the intertubercular plane. Dr. Paul Tuffier, a French surgeon, introduced this reference point in the early 20th century. Variations: It's important to note that individual anatomical variations exist, and the level of the iliac crests can vary among individuals. Therefore, healthcare providers may use additional methods, such as palpation of bony landmarks or radiological guidance, to accurately identify the L4-L5 intervertebral space.</li><li>\u2022 It serves as a reference point for various medical procedures, particularly those involving the lumbar spine, spinal anesthesia, and the placement of lumbar punctures (spinal taps).</li><li>\u2022 When performing a lumbar puncture, healthcare providers often use the intertubercular plane as a landmark to identify the appropriate level for inserting the needle into the subarachnoid space.

Ghrelin is specifically known for its role in increasing hunger and is sometimes referred to as the \"hunger hormone.\" It also influences the secretion of growth hormone and insulin, and it has a broader role in energy balance and metabolic processes. Some examples of orexigenic hormones: Ghrelin - Increases food intake (Hormones hunger), Growth hormone secretion, Increases insulin secretion. Orexin - produced by the hypothalamus and is involved in regulating sleep and appetite. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Agouti-related peptide (AgRP), can also stimulate appetite and promote food intake. Dysregulation of these hormones can contribute to conditions such as obesity and eating disorders.</li><li>\u2022 The orexinergic system includes hormones and neurotransmitters that affect the orexin receptors in the brain.

Chronic Use of Diuretics: Prolonged use of diuretics, particularly loop diuretics, can lead to increased urinary excretion of thiamine, thus potentially causing or exacerbating a deficiency.
