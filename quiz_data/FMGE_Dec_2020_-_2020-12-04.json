Superficial peroneal nerve</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 The superficial peroneal nerve is a branch of the common peroneal nerve (a division of the sciatic nerve). It innervates the muscles that control foot eversion, specifically the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis muscles. It also provides sensory innervation to the anterolateral aspect of the leg and the dorsum (top) of the foot.</li><li>\u2022 superficial peroneal nerve</li><li>\u2022 Effect of Lesion : If the superficial peroneal nerve is damaged or compressed, it can lead to weakness in the muscles responsible for foot eversion. Additionally, it can result in sensory loss on the anterolateral aspect of the leg and the dorsum of the foot. This condition is known as superficial peroneal nerve entrapment or injury .</li><li>\u2022 Effect of Lesion</li><li>\u2022 superficial peroneal nerve entrapment or injury</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.  Deep Peroneal Nerve : The deep peroneal nerve innervates the muscles that control foot dorsiflexion and toe extension. It also provides sensory innervation to the space between the first and second toes. Damage to this nerve would result in difficulty in dorsiflexion and toe extension, along with sensory loss in that specific area.</li><li>\u2022 Option A.  Deep Peroneal Nerve</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Sural Nerve : The sural nerve is a sensory nerve that provides innervation to the lateral aspect of the leg and the lateral foot. Damage to the sural nerve would primarily result in sensory loss in these areas. It would not directly affect foot eversion or motor function.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Sural Nerve</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Saphenous Nerve : The saphenous nerve is a sensory nerve that innervates the medial aspect of the leg and the foot.

The reduction in the gradient negatively affects the function of other ion exchangers, particularly the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, leading to reduced Ca2+ extrusion from the cell. The resultant increase in intracellular Ca2+ contributes to a less negative resting membrane potential, thus causing depolarization. Continued dysfunction of this pump can also lead to cellular swelling and eventual cell injury due to water following the retained Na+ into the cell.</li><li>\u2022 Intracellular accumulation of Na+ occurs because it is not being pumped out.</li><li>\u2022 The reduction in the gradient negatively affects the function of other ion exchangers, particularly the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, leading to reduced Ca2+ extrusion from the cell.</li><li>\u2022 The resultant increase in intracellular Ca2+ contributes to a less negative resting membrane potential, thus causing depolarization.</li><li>\u2022 Continued dysfunction of this pump can also lead to cellular swelling and eventual cell injury due to water following the retained Na+ into the cell.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

It is a C-shaped structure that is part of the telencephalon. It  is involved in various functions, including motor control , cognitive processes , and emotional processing . It plays a role in coordinating voluntary movements, procedural learning, and forming habits.

The insula , also known as the insular cortex or the island of Reil, is a region of the cerebral cortex located deep within the lateral sulcus (a groove) of the brain. It is considered part of the telencephalon. It is involved in a wide range of functions, including emotion , consciousness , perception , and self-awareness . It plays a role in processing emotional and sensory information, as well as regulating autonomic functions like heart rate and blood pressure. The insula is also implicated in social cognition and empathy.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.</li><li>\u2022 insula</li><li>\u2022 emotion</li><li>\u2022 consciousness</li><li>\u2022 perception</li><li>\u2022 self-awareness</li><li>\u2022 Option D. The basal ganglia is a complex network of nuclei located deep within the brain. It includes structures such as the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus. The basal ganglia plays a central role in motor control , cognitive functions , and emotional processing . It helps initiate and regulate voluntary movements, modulate muscle tone, and contribute to procedural learning and habit formation. Dysfunction in the basal ganglia can lead to a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</li><li>\u2022 Option D.</li><li>\u2022 basal ganglia</li><li>\u2022 motor control</li><li>\u2022 cognitive functions</li><li>\u2022 emotional processing</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Nomenclature of basal ganglia:</li><li>\u27a4 Nomenclature of basal ganglia:</li><li>\u27a4 Corpus striatum: Caudate nucleus and lenticular nuclei (the putamen, globus pallidus externus, and internus), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the substantia nigra (SN) Lentiform nucleus: Putamen + globus pallidus Neostriatum: Caudate nucleus + putamen</li><li>\u27a4 Corpus striatum: Caudate nucleus and lenticular nuclei (the putamen, globus pallidus externus, and internus), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the substantia nigra (SN)</li><li>\u27a4 Lentiform nucleus: Putamen + globus pallidus</li><li>\u27a4 Neostriatum: Caudate nucleus + putamen</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
