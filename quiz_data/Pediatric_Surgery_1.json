They may have internal and external components or both. Most are benign mature teratomas, but some contain immature embryonic elements. Complete excision is usually achieved in the prone position and must include removing the coccyx and reconstruction of the pelvic floor. If the intra-abdominal component is large or vascular, the median sacral artery can be ligated through the abdomen. Bladder and bowel function are assessed following the pelvic floor repair. \u03b1-Fetoprotein levels are measured to detect recurrence.</li><li>\u27a4 These germ cell tumours arise from the coccyx and are usually diagnosed antenatally.
