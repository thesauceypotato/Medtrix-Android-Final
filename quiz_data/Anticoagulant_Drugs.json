      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hyperkalemia is not seen</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Heparin blocks an enzymatic step in the synthesis of aldosterone and reduced aldosterone levels may be evident as early as four days after initiation of therapy. Although all patients who receive heparin may have reduced aldosterone levels, most can compensate through increased renin production and therefore remain asymptomatic. However, patients on prolonged heparin therapy or those unable to adequately increase renin production (e.g., patients with diabetes or renal insufficiency) may exhibit signs of hypoaldosteronism, such as hyperkalemia.

The aPTT is 1 of several blood coagulation tests. It measures how long it takes your blood to form a clot. Normally, when 1 of your blood vessels is damaged, proteins in your blood called clotting factors come together in a certain order to form blood clots and quickly stop bleeding. Option: C. Alopecia areata is a disease that happens when the immune system attacks hair follicles and causes hair loss. Hair follicles are the structures in the skin that form hair. While hair can be lost from any part of the body, alopecia areata usually affects the head and face. Option: D. Thrombocytopenia is a condition that occurs when the platelet count in your blood is too low. Platelets are tiny blood cells that are made in the bone marrow from larger cells. When you are injured, platelets stick together to form a plug to seal your wound. This plug is called a blood clot.</p>\n<p></p>",
