      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>It survives intracellularly within phagocytes of Peyer's patches This patient has typhoid fever (enteric fever), which is caused by Salmonella typhi, a motile gram-negative bacteria with peritrichous flagella. Salmonella has somatic O, capsular Vi, and flagellar H antigens. Typhoid fever presents as a gradual onset of high-grade fever over several days with relative bradycardia (Faget sign). Fever starts low and increases daily in a stepwise pattern. It is associated with generalized weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, and headaches. Some people develop rose-coloured spots on the abdomen. Diarrhoea and vomiting are uncommon. Untreated cases may lead to complications, including haemorrhage, intestinal perforation with resulting septicemia, and/or peritonitis, encephalitis, cholecystitis, and osteitis. Some people may carry the bacterium within their gallbladder without being affected, termed as \u2018carriers\u2019; however, they are still able to spread the disease to others. Typhoid fever spreads by the faecal-oral route. Salmonella enters the host's system primarily through the distal ileum (Peyer's patches). The bacteria survive inside macrophages and co-opt the macrophages' cellular machinery for their own reproduction as they are carried through the mesenteric lymph nodes to the reticuloendothelial tissues of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Some bacteria infect the gallbladder and come back again to the gut within bile, either to reinfect Peyer's patches or to be shed in faeces to infect other people. The diagnosis of typhoid fever is made by characteristic signs and symptoms along with observing Salmonella typhi in any blood, bone marrow, or stool cultures.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: Pseudomonas aeruginosa forms blue-green colonies with a fruity odor. It commonly causes skin and respiratory infections. Option C: Splenectomy increases the incidence of Salmonella infections. Salmonella has a capsule and the spleen is important for clearing the infection. This is the reason Salmonella infections are more common in patients with sickle cell disease who have functional asplenia. Option D: The incidence of typhoid fever decreases after cholecystectomy. Salmonella resides within the gallbladder of carriers and sheds the bacteria within bile only to be passed in the feces and infect others. One of the treatment options for carriers who do not respond to medical treatment is cholecystectomy.</p>\n<p></p>",
