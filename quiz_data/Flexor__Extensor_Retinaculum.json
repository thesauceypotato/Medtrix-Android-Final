The lateral border (radial side) is a pair of parallel and intimate tendons, of the extensor pollicis brevis and the abductor pollicis longus. The proximal border is formed by the styloid process of the radius The distal border is formed by the approximate apex of the schematic snuffbox isosceles triangle. The floor of the snuffbox varies depending on the position of the wrist, but both the trapezium and primarily the scaphoid can be palpated. The pain in the anatomical snuff box points towards a scaphoid fracture after a fall on an outstretched hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options B, C, and D are all incorrect statements regarding the boundaries of the Anatomical Snuffbox.</p>\n<p></p>",
