      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Karyotyping When a pregnant woman has a history of previous child with Down syndrome, it becomes important to know the type of chromosomal constitution, not only in that particular child but also in the parents because the risk of recurrence in future pregnancy depends on all these factors. Karyotyping of Mrs. Rawat has already been done and a translocation variety of Down\u2019s detected. Risk of recurrence however does not depend on mother\u2019s karyotype alone, but it also depends on the father\u2019s karyotype . Father\u2019s karyotyping is therefore the test of choice prior to next pregnancy to determine the risk of recurrence.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Currently we are using following for obtaining tissue sample for karyotyping : Chorionic villi sampling: Performed at 10-13 weeks . The chorionic villi are formed by trophoblast and hence study material is trophoblast . In a morula the outer layer is trophoblast and inside is inner cell mass, So whatever chromosomal abnormalities are seen in fetus can be detected by CVS. DNA analysis of CVS specimens is helpful for early diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies and all metabolic problems like gaucher's disease, phenylketonuria can also be detected by CVS. Amniocentesis: It is an invasive procedure performed between 15 to 20 weeks for detecting fetal karyotype. It is done under ultrasound guidance using a 22 gauge spinal needle. The spinal needle is passed through the mothers lower abdomen into the amniotic cavity inside the uterus and 10-20 ml of amniotic fluid is collected. Amniotic fluid has cells from amnion, fetal skin and lungs which are collected and cultured for fetal karyotyping, biochemical and metabolic analysis . Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS/Cordocentesis): The most frequent indication for cordocentesis is rapid karyotyping of the fetus . In PUBS a needle is inserted into the umbilical cord under ultrasound guidance and fetal blood is collected from the umbilical vein. PUBS is   useful in evaluating fetal metabolism and hematologic abnormalities. PUBS can be easily done after 24 weeks and by skilled operators as early as 18 weeks of gestation.  It is done between 17 and 20 weeks to detect serious skin disorders like epidermolysis bullosa , oculocutaneous albinism , etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>For down`s syndrome : 1st trimester 2nd trimester Screening test Nuchal translucency + BhCG + PAPPA, i.e. combined test Quad test/Triple test Diagnostic test (karyotyping) Chronic Villi sampling Amniocentesis</p>\n<p></p>",
