It is characterized by painful violaceous skin lesions with associated ulceration, ischemia, necrosis, and eschar formation. An urgent parathyroidectomy has been shown to decrease pain, improve wound healing and reduce the risk of amputation in these patients. It has also been associated with an increase in median survival.

The causes : medically-refractory hyperphosphatemia, a high calcium-phosphate product, high PTH levels, use of warfarin, protein C and protein S deficiency, and other causes of thrombophilia.
