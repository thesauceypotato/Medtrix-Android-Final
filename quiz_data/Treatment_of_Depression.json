      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Continue Sertraline for 3 more weeks This patient meets the criteria for major depressive disorder given her depressed mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. SSRIs such as sertraline are recommended first-line medications but may require 3-4 weeks for significant therapeutic effects . The most common clinical mistake leading to an unsuccessful trial of an antidepressant drug is the use of too low a dosage for too short a time . Unless adverse events prevent it, the dosage of an antidepressant should be raised to the maximum recommended level and maintained at that level for at least 4 or 5 weeks before a drug trial is considered unsuccessful . Therefore, this patient should continue sertraline with close follow-up before switching to a new treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A: Electroconvulsive therapy is appropriate in depressive patients with severe suicidal tendencies or refusal of food resulting in malnutrition. This patient has no evidence of suicidal tendency or malnutrition that would warrant ECT at this time. Option: B Antidepressants may take up to 3 to 4 weeks to exert significant therapeutic effects, so the medication should not be changed as the patient has received the medication for only 2 weeks. Option: C Monoamine oxidase inhibitors , such as phenelzine , should never be combined with SSRIs due to the risk of serotonin syndrome . Additionally, MAOI is not the first-line treatment option for MDD due to its high side effect profile.</p>\n<p></p>",

The goal of cognitive therapy is to alleviate depressive episodes and prevent their recurrence by helping patients identify and test negative cognitions ; develop alternative, flexible, and positive ways of thinking; and rehearse new cognitive and behavioral responses. Interpersonal Therapy - It focuses on one or two of a patient's current interpersonal problems . The interpersonal therapy program usually consists of 12 to 16 weekly sessions and is characterized by an active therapeutic approach. Behavioral Therapy - By addressing maladaptive behaviors in therapy, patients learn to function in the world in such a way that they receive positive reinforcement . Psychoanalytically Oriented Therapy - The goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy is to effect a change in a patient's personality structure or character, not simply to alleviate symptoms. Family Therapy - Family therapy examines the role of the mood-disordered member in the overall psychological well-being of the whole family; it also examines the role of the entire family in the maintenance of the patient's symptoms.</p>\n<p></p>",
