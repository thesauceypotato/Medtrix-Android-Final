Vocal nodules.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- O ption: A. Under the epithelium of vocal cords is a potential space with scanty subepithelial connective tissues. It is bounded above and below by the arcuate lines, in front by the anterior commissure, and behind by the vocal process of the arytenoid. Oedema of this space causes fusiform swelling of the membranous cords (Reinke\u2019s oedema). O ption: B. Contact ulcer is again due to faulty voice production in which vo- cal processes of arytenoids hammer against each other, resulting in ulceration and granuloma formation. Some cases are due to gastric reflux. O ption: C. Vocal polyp is the result of vocal abuse or misuse. Other contributing factors are allergies and smoking. Primarily, it affects men in the age group of 30\u201350 years. Typically, a vocal polyp is unilateral, arising from the same position as a vocal nodule. It is soft, smooth and often pedunculated.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>They mainly affect teachers, actors, vendors or pop singers.
