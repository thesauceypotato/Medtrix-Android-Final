      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Rubella In a typical case of measles, the clinical features comprise the following: (a) Prodromal: the prodromal symptoms (coryza, sore throat, low-grade fever) herald the onset of viremia. They are generally mild and insignificant and less frequent in children. (b) Lymphadenopathy: in susceptible individuals, the enlargement of the postauricular and posterior cervical lymph nodes appears as early as 7 days before the appearance of the rash. This, however, is not pathognomonic since cases of clinical rubella without enlargement of lymph nodes have been documented. The glands may be enlarged for 10 to 14 days after the rash. (c) Rash: the rash is often the first indication of the disease in children. It appears first on the face, usually within 24 hours of the onset of prodromal symptoms. It is a minute, discrete, pinkish, macular rash and not confluent as the rash of measles. Conjunctivitis may occur. The rash spreads rapidly to the trunk and extremities.

In the absence of complications, the lesions and fever disappear in another 3 or 4 days, signaling the end of the disease. The rash fades in the same order of appearance, leaving a brownish discoloration that may persist for 2 months or more. Option: B. smallpox Distribution of rash: A. Centrifugal B. Palms and soles frequently involved C. Axilla usually free D. Rash predominant on extensor surfaces and bony prominences. Vesicles multilocular and umbilicated Characteristics of the rash deep-seated Only one stage of rash may be seen at one time No area of inflammation is seen around the vesicles. Evolution of rash: Evolution of rash is slow, deliberate, and majestic, passing through definite stages of macule, papule, vesicle, and pustule scabs that begin to form 10-14 days after the rash appears fever subsides with the appearance of the rash. May rise again in the pustular stage (secondary rise of fever).

Communicability diminishes rapidly after the catarrhal stage. Early diagnosis, isolation and treatment of cases, and disinfection of discharges from nose and throat are the general principles of control of whooping cough. Early diagnosis is possible only by bacteriological examination of nose and throat secretions which may be obtained by naso-pharyngeal swabs. The chances of isolating the organism are < 60 per cent if the material is obtained within 10-14 days from the onset of illness. The value of fluorescent antibody technique has been emphasized in facilitating the rapid diagnosis of pertussis. The patient should be isolated until considered to be non-infectious.</p>\n<p></p>",

The bacilli multiply enormously in the gut of the rat flea and may block the proventriculus so that no food can pass through. Such a flea is called \u2018blocked flea' It makes frantic efforts to bite and suck blood over and over again and in so doing it inoculates (regurgitates) plague bacilli into the bite wound each time it bites. A blocked flea eventually faces starvation and dies. A partially blocked flea is more dangerous than a completely blocked flea because it can live longer.</p>\n<p></p>",

Therefore all children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) should be reported and tested for wild poliovirus within 48 hours of onset, even if doctors are confident on clinical grounds that the child does not have polio. To test for polio, faecal specimens are analyzed for the presence of poliovirus. Because shedding of the virus is variable, two specimens - taken 24-48 hours apart are required. Speed is essential, since the highest concentrations of poliovirus in the stools of infected individuals are found during the first two weeks after onset of paralysis. Immediately inside a refrigerator or packed between frozen ice packs at 4-8\u00b0 c in a cold box, ready for shipment to a laboratory. Undue delays or prolonged exposure to heat on the way to the laboratory may destroy the virus. Specimens should arrive at the laboratory within 72 hours of collection.</p>\n<p></p>",
