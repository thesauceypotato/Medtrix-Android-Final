While walking, the arm swings widely. These movements are called the flinging movements. These movements are due to the release phenomenon because of the absence of inhibitory influence on movements. Hemiballismus occurs due to degeneration of subthalamic nucleus of Luys.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Globus pallidus</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Putamen : Also incorrect for this symptom.

D) Captopril</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Captopril, an ACE inhibitor, has been shown to improve survival and delay the progression of heart failure. ACE inhibitors like Captopril work by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation and reduced workload on the heart. This class of drugs is considered a cornerstone in the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF). The benefits of ACE inhibitors in heart failure are well-documented, including the 1992 study on Enalapril, which demonstrated its effectiveness as a gold standard treatment.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
