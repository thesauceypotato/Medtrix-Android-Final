      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>PRP Given is a scenario of diabetic retinopathy with proliferation. In such an advanced case, best possible management is to photocoagulation most of the retina except for the essential macular part to avoid further complications. By destroying the largely unused, ischemic extramacular retina , PRP reduces the area of ischemic tissue , which in turn reduces total vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in the eye and thereby reducing the impetus for neovascularization. PRP is indicated to treat retinal ischemia and retinal neovascularization , from whatever cause. However, PRP is most common for proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Option B and C: Focal laser Tx is used to treat macular edema due to focal leakage. While Grid Tx is used to treat macular edema due to diffuse leakage.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Signs of Diabetic Retinopathy:- Retina thickening and edema (swelling) New blood vessels Hemorrhages Microaneurysms Cotton wool spots Hard exudates.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Pathophysiology DR is a microangiopathy primarily affecting the precapillary arterioles capillaries, venules and post capillary venules.
