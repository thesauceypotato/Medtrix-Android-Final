The two most common locations are cranially at the clivus and in the sacrum at the bottom of the spine. A possible association with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1 or TSC2) has been suggested. In most cases, complete surgical resection followed by radiation therapy offers the best chance of long-term control. Chordomas are relatively radioresistant, requiring high doses of radiation to be controlled. The proximity of chordomas to vital neurological structures such as the brainstem and nerves, limits the dose of radiation that can safely be delivered. Therefore, highly focused radiation such as proton therapy and carbon ion therapy are more effective than conventional X-ray radiation. The PDGFR inhibitor Imatinib and sirolimus can be used but only with a modest response.</p>\n<p></p>",

As the kidneys ascend, the ureters elongate and open into the bladder superiorly, while the roots of the mesonephric ducts are carried inferiorly, before fusing to form the trigone region The ureteric bud also known as the metanephrogenic diverticulum is a protrusion from the mesonephric duct.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Collecting ducts of the permanent kidney develop from the ureteric bud, an outgrowth of the mesonephric duct close to its entrance to the cloaca . The bud penetrates the meta- nephric tissue, which is molded over its distal end as a cap. Subsequently, the bud dilates, forming the primitive renal pelvis, and splits into cranial and caudal portions, the future major calyces.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A.  Metanephros The metanephros forms the definitive kidney. It appears in the 5th week of development and becomes functional around the 12th week. The ureteric bud from the mesonephric duct makes contact with a caudal region of intermediate mesoderm \u2013 the metanephric blastema OPTION C. Mesonephros The mesonephros persists and forms the anterior portion of the permanent kidneys in fish and amphibians, but in reptiles, birds, and mammals, it atrophies and for the most part disappears rapidly as the permanent kidney (metanephros) begins to develop during the sixth or seventh week. OPTION D. Urogenital sinus The urogenital sinus is a part of the human body only present in the development of the urinary and reproductive organs. It is the ventral part of the cloaca, formed after the cloaca separates from the anal canal during the fourth to seventh weeks of development.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The ureteric bud gives rise to the ureter, the renal pelvis, the major and minor calyces,and approximately 1 to 3 million collecting tubules.</p>\n<p></p>",

Spiral or twisted fibers are also found in trapezius, latissimus dorsi and supinator. Pectoralis major may also be called a convergent muscle (the fascicles extend from a broad, fan-shape area and converge on a single attachment site where the muscle interacts with a tendon). In certain muscles the fasciculi are crossed. These are called cruciate muscles, e.g. sternocleidomastoid, masseter and adductor magnus.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Important types morphological of muscles fibres</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A.
