Four classical maneuvers are used to palpate the gravid uterus systematically. This method of abdominal palpation is of low cost, easy to perform, and non-invasive. It is used to determine the position, presentation, and engagement of the fetus in utero. The First Maneuver : Also called the fundal grip, assesses the uterine fundus to determine its height and which fetal pole\u2014that is, cephalic or podalic\u2014occupies the fundus. The Second Maneuver: The second maneuver sometimes called the umbilical grip, involves palpation of the lateral uterine surfaces. Still facing the maternal xiphoid cartilage, both hands slide down from the uterine fundus towards the lateral uterine walls. The Third Maneuver: The third maneuver was modified by Karel Pawlik and is referred to as the Pawlik grip. This maneuver aids in the confirmation of fetal presentation. The first Pawlik grip, sometimes called the first pelvic grip, helps to define which presenting part of the fetus is situated in the hypogastrium. In the second Pawl\u00edk grip, the clinician carries on by sliding the hand upward to determine the cervical groove: if the mass moves, the presenting part is not engaged. The Fourth Maneuver: This fourth maneuver resembles the first maneuver; however, the examiner faces towards the maternal pelvis. This maneuver involves the examiner placing the palms of both hands on either side of the lower abdomen, with the tips of the fingers facing downward toward the pelvic inlet. This maneuver identifies which presenting part is in the lower uterine pole. To perceive how much of the cephalic extremity, which we recognized to be at the lower pole, descends into the birth canal: if it is entirely external, then it has not confronted itself, if it is confronting itself or if it has ultimately descended.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Completing the fourth maneuver with the so-called \"fifth maneuver\" of Leopold, or maneuver of Zagenmeister , also can allow the approximate distance between the presenting part and the maternal pelvis.</p>\n<p></p>",

Fetal monitoring is used to assess the adequacy of fetal oxygenation during labour (ACOG, 2009) with the goal being to prevent metabolic acidemia. Metabolic acidemia can develop over 60 min following a fetus being deprived of adequate oxygenation. Hypoxia during labour can be caused by compression of the umbilical cord, or in more serious cases, by decreased placental perfusion during a uterine contraction seen in late decelerations. Women with preeclampsia, type 1 diabetes, preterm birth, and suspected intrauterine fetal growth restriction have high-risk conditions and should be monitored with EFM; healthy women without complications would be considered low-risk and can use intermittent auscultation</p>\n<p></p>",

It affects 0.1 \u2013 0.6% of births. Cord prolapse occurs in the presence of ruptured membranes, and is either occult or overt: Occult (incomplete) cord prolapse \u2013 the umbilical cord descends alongside the presenting part, but not beyond it. Overt (complete) cord prolapse \u2013 the umbilical cord descends past the presenting part and is lower than the presenting part in the pelvis. Cord presentation \u2013 the presence of the umbilical cord between the presenting part and the cervix. This can occur with or without intact membranes. Although the incidence is relatively low, the mortality rate for such babies is high (91 per 1000). This is largely because cord prolapse occurs more frequently in preterm babies, who are often breech, and who may also have other congenital defects. Pathophysiology: Umbilical cord prolapse is where the umbilical cord descends through the cervix, with (or before) the presenting part of the fetus. Subsequently, fetal hypoxia occurs via two main mechanisms: Occlusion \u2013 the presenting part of the fetus presses onto the umbilical cord, occluding blood flow to the fetus. Arterial vasospasm \u2013 the exposure of the umbilical cord to the cold atmosphere results in umbilical arterial vasospasm, reducing blood flow to the fetus. Cord prolapse should always be considered in the presence of a non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern and absent membranes. It can be confirmed by external inspection or on digital vaginal examination.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Management: Firstly, call for help \u2013 umbilical cord prolapse is an obstetric emergency. It should be managed as follows: Avoid handling the cord to reduce vasospasm. Manually elevate the presenting part by lifting the presenting part of the cord by vaginal digital examination. Alternatively, if in the community, fill the maternal bladder with 500ml of normal saline (warmed if possible) via a urinary catheter and arrange immediate hospital transfer. Encourage into left lateral position with head down and a pillow placed under left hip OR knee-chest position. This will relieve pressure off the cord from the presenting part. Consider tocolysis (e.g. terbutaline) \u2013 if delivery is not imminently available this will relax the uterus and stop contractions, relieving pressure off the cord. It may be sufficient to allow enough time for transfer to a location where delivery is feasible (e.g. an operating theatre for a Caesarean section). Delivery is usually via emergency Caesarean section If fully dilated and vaginal delivery appears imminent, encourage pushing or consider instrumental delivery. If at the threshold for viability (23 + 0 weeks \u2013 24 + 6 weeks) and extreme prematurity, expectant management may be discussed due to significant maternal morbidity with caesarean at this gestation and poor fetal outcomes.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
