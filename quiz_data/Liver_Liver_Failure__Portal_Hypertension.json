Viral hepatitis, including hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E, is a common cause of acute liver failure. Drug reactions can also lead to acute liver failure, such as reactions to halothane, isoniazid-rifampicin, antidepressants, NSAIDs, and valproic acid. Paracetamol overdose, prescription medicines like antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and statins, as well as herbal supplements, can also cause acute liver failure. Mushroom poisoning, exposure to toxins like carbon tetrachloride, and shock and multiorgan failure are other possible causes. Autoimmune disease, acute Budd-Chiari syndrome, rare metabolic disorders (including Wilson's disease), cancer, and fatty liver during pregnancy can also lead to acute liver failure. Heat stroke, Reye's syndrome in children following viral infection (including chickenpox), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can also cause liver failure in some cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Opton: A. Free radicals that are produced by the metabolism of halothane in the liver can modify cellular proteins and introduce neo-antigens to the immune system. Clinically, it is characterized by fever, jaundice, and grossly elevated serum transaminase levels. Halothane can also be associated with an increased risk of halothane hepatitis. Opton: B. Rifampicin is associated with transient and asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels and is a well-known cause of clinically apparent, acute liver disease that can be severe and even fatal. Opton: C. Some antidepressants can damage your liver over time, including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants, bupropion, duloxetine, and agomelatine. Antidepressant drugs with a lower risk of liver damage include citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine.</p>\n<p></p>",

The configuration of the segments is relatively constant, although their shape varies among individuals. The hepatic artery , which supplies arterial blood, originates from the coeliac trunk in most individuals, which gives rise to the left gastric, common hepatic, and splenic arteries. The hepatic artery branches at a variable level to produce the right and left hepatic arteries, with the larger right branch supplying the right lobe. The right lobe may be partly or entirely supplied by a right hepatic artery that arises directly from the superior mesenteric artery and runs to the liver on the posterior wall of the bile duct after passing behind the uncinate process and head of the pancreas.
