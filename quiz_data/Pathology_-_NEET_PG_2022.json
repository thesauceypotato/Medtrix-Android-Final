Respiratory muscles may get involved leading to eventual death.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) It is an X-linked recessive disorder that primarily affects males. Cause: Mutation in the DMD gene, which codes for the protein dystrophin. Pathophysiology: Dystrophin is an important protein that helps maintain the structure and stability of muscle fibers. In DMD, the absence of dystrophin leads to progressive muscle weakness and wasting. Features: Symptoms appear in early childhood Difficulty walking, frequent falls, and muscle weakness in the hips, thighs, and shoulders. As the disease progresses, it can affect the heart and respiratory muscles, leading to life-threatening complications. Most boys with DMD lose the ability to walk by their teenage years and typically die in their 20s or 30s.

Hyaline membranes are formed due to the accumulation of plasma proteins and cellular debris in the alveoli, resulting in damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier. Inflammation : ARDS is characterized by an inflammatory response in the lungs, which is indicated by the presence of neutrophils and macrophages in the alveoli and interstitial spaces. Edema : The alveolar-capillary barrier in the lungs becomes leaky in ARDS, leading to the accumulation of fluid in the alveoli and interstitial spaces, which is known as pulmonary edema. Alveolar damage : The histopathological features of ARDS include damage to the alveolar walls, leading to the collapse of the alveoli and impaired gas exchange in the lungs. Fibrosis : In some cases of ARDS, there may be the development of fibrosis (scarring) in the lungs, which can lead to long-term respiratory problems. https://images.app.goo.gl/BbY2go5WsikXVKyr7</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B.

Serum Folate: Folate deficiency can cause megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by macrocytic red blood cells. The patient's microcytic hypochromic anemia and reduced RBC indices make folate deficiency less likely as the underlying cause. Option D . Homocysteine: Elevated homocysteine levels are associated with vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency, which can both cause macrocytic anemia.

Malakoplakia is believed to result from the inadequate killing of bacteria by macrophages or monocytes that exhibit defective phagolysosomal activity. Partially digested bacteria accumulate in monocytes or macrophages and lead to the deposition of calcium and iron on residual bacterial glycolipid. The presence of the resulting basophilic inclusion structure, the Michaelis-GutmannA body, is pathognomonic for malakoplakia and can be seen in the image given. Patients typically present with a history of immunosuppression due to renal transplantation,diabetes mellitus, or lymphoma or a history of receiving long-term therapy with systemic corticosteroids. Close to one quarter of patients present with internal organ involvement, most commonly in the retroperitoneal area, the kidney, the bladder, or the colon. Please note that it rarely presents in patients with HIV infectionand AIDS, which may be because of the preservation of monocytic antimicrobial function in these patients.

Bacterial organisms can further ascend through the ureter and infect the kidney causing pyelonephritis. It is important to distinguish between uncomplicated and complicated UTI Uncomplicated UTI: this describes acute cystitis or pyelonephritis in outpatient women who are not pregnant and do not have anatomic abnormalities or instrumentation within the urinary tract Complicated UTI: this describes UTI that is not uncomplicated</p>\n<p></p>",

IDA: It  (Iron Deficiency Anemia) is the most common cause of microcytic. Hypothyroidism causes reduced production of HCl leading to altered iron absorption leading to IDA but macrocyclic anemia is more common. Option C. Megaloblastic anemia: It is a type of vitamin deficiency anemia that happens when you don't get enough vitamin B12 and/or vitamin B9 (folate). Option D .Sickle cell anemia: It  is a hemoglobinopathy caused by mutation of SCD gene on chromosome 11.  It is characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin and sickle-shaped red blood cells. It is not directly associated with goiter or hypothyroidism.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA RBC morphology  and inclusions Abnormal RBC morphology Common RBC inclusions</p>\n<p></p>",

Normocytic hypochromic: It refers to anemia with normal-sized but pale red blood cells and is often associated with chronic diseases or certain types of anemia of chronic inflammation. Option C.

Normocytic normochromic anemia: it refers to anemia with normal-sized and normally colored red blood cells. This type of anemia can be seen in various conditions, including acute blood loss, hemolytic anemia, and certain chronic diseases.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA RBC morphology  and inclusions Abnormal RBC morphology Common RBC inclusions</p>\n<p></p>",
