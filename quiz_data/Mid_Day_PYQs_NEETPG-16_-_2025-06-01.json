They are a pair of 0.5 cm glands located in the lower right and left portions at the 4 o\u2019clock and 8 o\u2019clock positions of the vaginal introitus. They are generally nonpalpable when not obstructed.</li><li>\u2022 Pathophysiology: Bartholin glands can form a cyst and an abscess in women of reproductive age and may cause dyspareunia, urinary irritation, and vague pelvic pain.</li><li>\u2022 C/F:</li><li>\u2022 The physical exam will often reveal asymmetry with a protrusion of one side (left or right) of the inferior aspect of the vulva. Bartholin gland abscesses, unlike Bartholin cysts, are very painful. While both are primarily unilateral, Bartholin abscesses are often tender to palpation, erythematous, indurated, and may have an area of fluctuance and/or purulent drainage. Treatment Asymptomatic Bartholin cysts do not require further treatment. Bartholin abscesses may be treated with incision and drainage with Word catheter placement due to ease and effectiveness of treatment. Marsupialization is the procedure of choice. Women with recurrent cysts or those who are post-menopausal (risk of malignancy) should have the cyst completely excised.</li><li>\u2022 The physical exam will often reveal asymmetry with a protrusion of one side (left or right) of the inferior aspect of the vulva.</li><li>\u2022 Bartholin gland abscesses, unlike Bartholin cysts, are very painful.</li><li>\u2022 While both are primarily unilateral, Bartholin abscesses are often tender to palpation, erythematous, indurated, and may have an area of fluctuance and/or purulent drainage.</li><li>\u2022 Treatment</li><li>\u2022 Asymptomatic Bartholin cysts do not require further treatment.</li><li>\u2022 Bartholin abscesses may be treated with incision and drainage with Word catheter placement due to ease and effectiveness of treatment.</li><li>\u2022 Marsupialization is the procedure of choice.</li><li>\u2022 Women with recurrent cysts or those who are post-menopausal (risk of malignancy) should have the cyst completely excised.</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
