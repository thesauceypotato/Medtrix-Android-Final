Wobble position is the 3rd position of the codon on mRNA and the first position of anticodon on tRNA in the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 direction (see fig below). Bases in the wobble position are wobble bases. Wobble bases can base pair via non-Watson Crick base pairing (Watson Crick base pairing is: A only pair with T and G with C). Let\u2019s find the wobble base of the tRNA in the question. The first base (5'-3' direction) of the anticodon is Inosine (I). Thus, it is the wobble base of tRNA here. Inosine (I) in the wobble base can base pair with C , A, or U but not with G . So, the codons it can recognize or pair with are GC C , GC A, and GC U but not GCG.

For example, if the serine (Ser) codon UCA is given a different third base, U, to become UCU, it still codes for Ser. This is termed a \u201csilent\u201d mutation. This mutation occurs as the codon is degenerate i.e one amino acid can be coded by more than one codon. Missense Mutation: The codon containing the changed base codes for the different amino acids.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>5\u2032-CCATGCCATTTGCATCA -3\u2032 In order to answer this question, one first needs to find the start codon: AUG in mRNA and ATG in DNA. Bases 3 to 5 in all first three sequences contain this element. So options d and e are excluded Next, the sequence needs to specify a phenylalanine residue near the amino terminus, which is UUU or UUC in mRNA, or TTT or TTG in DNA, but these sequences need to be in frame with the initiating methionine codon. This condition is satisfied in options a and b. So, option c is excluded The last element to look for is the absence of a premature stop codon because this protein is 300 amino acids long. There should be no stop sequence in the remaining bases of the required piece of DNA. For option b , the last three bases of this sequence are TGA, which in mRNA would be UGA, and this is an in-frame stop signal. So, t his sequence would not give rise to a protein that contained 300 amino acids. But in option a there is no premature stop codon and hence it is the answer.</p>\n<p></p>",
