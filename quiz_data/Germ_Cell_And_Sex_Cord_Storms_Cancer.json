It is associated with endometrial hyperplasia in 25%-30% of the cases. Heavy, irregular menstrual bleeding and postmenopausal bleeding are common and reflect prolonged exposure of the endometrium to estrogen. Granulosa Cell Tumor Age: It can be seen at any age. Most common before puberty and after 40 years . (Maximum incidence at 52 years). Tumour secretes estrogen which is responsible for its clinical features. Most common symptoms are Menometrorrhagia and post-menopausal bleeding . Pathology They are low-grade malignancies . Almost always unilateral (B/L in < 2%) Encapsulated tumors and have a smooth surface. On microscopy: Granulosa cells exhibit coffee bean nuclei and call Exner bodies. Metastasis: It is peculiar in the case of granulosa cell tumors , it first involves the opposite ovary followed by metastasis in the lumbar region. Secondary deposits are also seen in the mesentery, liver, and mediastinum . Malignant transformation Since they secrete estrogen, 25\u201350% are associated with Endometrial hyperplasia. 5 percent of tumors are associated with endometrial cancer. Recurrence: is common but manifests late. Marker: Granulosa cell tumors secrete inhibin which is a useful marker for it. Management: Surgery is the TOC. Type of surgery depends on the age of occurrence</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. is Incorrect endodermal sinus tumor is associated with an elevated level of Alpha-fetoprotein, not of elevated level of estrogen so endometrial hyperplasia is not seen Option: B. is incorrect in dysgerminoma in 5% of the cases elevated beta HCG level is found.

Another possible site of disease among these high-risk patients is the fallopian tube therefore should be removed. IN BRCA 1 or BRCA-2 mutation carriers, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BS0) may be performed on either completion of childbearing or at age 35 . In these patients, the procedure is approximately 90% effective in preventing epithelial ovarian cancer . In women with HNPCC, the risk reduction approaches 100%.\u201d An additional benefit of prophylactic oophorectomy is that the risk of breast cancer is reduced by 50-80% . Oral contraceptive pills: The oral contraceptive pill is associated with a 50% decreased risk of developing ovarian cancer in women who have a mutation in either in BRCA - 1 or BRCA - 2. However, there is a short-term increased risk of developing breast cancer. Role of screening with CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasound: \u201cIn BRCA1- BRCA2 mutation carriers who do not wish to undergo prophylactic surgery a combination of thorough pelvic examination, transvaginal sonographic examination, and CA125 blood testing should be done\u201d.

Arises from stromal cells Peakage -perimenopausal female. U/L Hard in consistency Microscopy shows spindle-shaped cells When fibroma is accompanied by ascites and hydrothorax (usually the right side) It is called Meigs syndrome. BEST prognosis: Ascites and right-sided hydrothorax in association with fibroma of the ovary is called Meig\u2019s syndrome . True Meig\u2019s syndrome is rare occurring in < 5 percent of fibromas. Hydrothorax can be bilateral also. Ascites are caused by the transudation of fluid from the ovarian fibroma. Hydrothorax develops secondary to the flow of ascitic fluid into the pleural space via lymphatics of the diaphragm. Ascites occur (in 50% of cases) when the tumor size is > 6 cm. Tumours producing Meig\u2019s syndrome manifest in the late childbearing period i.e., 30\u201340 years. Both ascites and hydrothorax resolve spontaneously after the removal of the tumor. Criteria for diagnosis of Meig\u2019s syndrome: Tumour must be ovarian, solid, and benign. Both hydrothorax and ascites must be present. Removal o f the tumor must result in a spontaneous and permanent cure . Pseduomeig syndrome: Can be seen in association with either benign or malignant tumors. It can also be seen in Brenner\u2019s tumor and Granulosa cell tumor where it is called Pseudomeig\u2019s syndrome. Hydrothorax could be a manifestation of pulmonary metastasis. Syndrome can result from overstimulation of the ovaries with gonadotropins but, in such cases, the peritoneal exudate is more likely to be caused by an electrolyte imbalance rather than by an ovarian tumor.</p>\n<p></p>",

Granulosa cell tumor is a sex cord tumor Age : It can be seen at any age. Most common before puberty and after 40 years.(Maximum incidence at 52 years). Tumour secretes estrogen which is responsible for clinical features like precocious puberty, menometrorrhagia, and post-menopausal bleeding. They are low-grade malignancies. Almost always unilateral ( B/L in < 2%) i.e.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Malignant transformation: Since they secrete estrogen, 25\u201350% are associated with Endometrial hyperplasia. 5 percent o f tumors are associated with endometrial cancer. There is strong evidence that carcinoma of the endometrium may be associated with feminizing tumors of the ovary in postmenopausal women.\u201d Marker: Granulosa cell tumor secretes inhibin which is a useful marker for it. Prognosis: Is good with a 5-year survival rate being 90%. Metastasis: It is peculiar in the case of granulosa cell tumor, it first involves the opposite ovary followed by metastasis in the lumbar region.</p>\n<p></p>",

Typically, the abdominal incision must be adequate to identify and resect any disease that may have been missed on physical examination or imaging tests. The operation begins by aspirating free ascitic fluid or collecting peritoneal washing followed by visualization and palpation of all peritoneal surfaces and viscera proceeding in a clockwise manner from the cecum. Next an extra fascial (simple) hysterectomy and BSO are performed and an infrasonic omentectomy is done. In the absence of gross extra ovarian disease, peritoneal biopsies are obtained, along with a biopsy or scraping of the right diaphragm. Finally, a pelvic and infrarenal para-aortic lymphadenectom y is complete.</p>\n<p></p>",
