In such cases, therapeutic amniocentesis, termed amnioreduction, is done.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Amnio reduction helps in polyhydramnios by: Relieving respiratory distress by reducing mechanical pressure on the diaphragm. It may improve obstructive uropathy . It may lower the preterm delivery risk if the patient has preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Diuretics have no role in this condition. Option: B. Indomethacin therapy used to be given earlier as it reduced amniotic fluid However, it is not given anymore due to the risk of premature closure of ductus arteriosus. Option: D. Artificial rupture of membranes (ARM) is avoided as: Once ARM is done, delivery needs to be performed. In this case, preterm delivery would occur. Hence ARM is avoided. ARM should be used with caution in patients with chronic polyhydramnios. It can lead to sudden decompression of the uterus, causing placental abruption. Thus, controlled ARM is done in these patients.</p>\n<p></p>",

Thromboplastin-rich liquor amnii containing the debris blocks the pulmonary arteries and triggers the complex coagulation mechanism leading to DIC. There is massive fibrin deposition distributed throughout the entire pulmonary vascular tree. If the patient survives the severe cardiopulmonary embarrassment, which stimulates the thromboembolic phenomenon, there will be severe clotting defects due to the consumption of coagulation factors. From the damaged endothelium of the pulmonary arteries, massive fibrinolytic activators are produced, which excite the fibrinolytic system converting the plasminogen to plasmin which in turn produces lysis of fibrin, fibrinogen and even the factor V and factor VIII. Thus, secondary fibrinolysis is on top of primary fibrinogen depletion arising from DIC .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Other options: A, B & C, are correct with respect to amniotic fluid embolism.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is used for: Treatment of variable or prolonged decelerations As prophylaxis for women with oligohydramnios due to prolonged rupture of membrane. To dilute or wash out thick meconium To reduce fetal gasping which is result of hypoxia occurring due to cord compression. IT CAN ALSO BE USED FOR DIAGNOSIS OF: 1. Renal agenesis 2. PROM (premature rupture of membrane ). Procedure : Amnioinfusion in patients with oligohydramnios is not a simple procedure. The needle should be advanced slowly with continuous ultrasound visualization and when its tip has reached the interface between the fetus and the membranes warmed saline solution should be infused. In majority of cases, 250-350 ml of saline solution will be necessary to achieve optimal ultrasound transmission and perform a careful level II examination. A normal fetus will swallow the infused fluid, and its bladder will be easily seen with ultrasound after 20 minutes. The bladder will not be seen in fetuses with renal agenesis. Before ending the amnioinfusion, 1 ml of indigo carmine is injected inside the amniotic sac. The patient is instructed to wear a tampon for a few hours following the procedure and observe for evidence of blue discoloration. This finding will confirm the presence of PROM.\" Saline is infused at 37`o C . 250ml of saline is infused in 30 min</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option:B.
