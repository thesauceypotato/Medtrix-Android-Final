Appointment of district Judge is done either by the state Government in consultation with the High Court or by way of elevation of Judges from courts subordinate to district courts . While It can try cases which have been committed to it by a Magistrate, it also tries cases directly. So High court is a better answer ; it is primarily a court of appeal .
