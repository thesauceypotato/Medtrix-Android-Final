Stage of chronic catarrhal dacryocystitis: It is characterized by mild inflammation of the lacrimal sac associated with blockage of NLD. Watering eyes is the only symptom in this stage and sometimes mild redness in the inner canthus. On syringing the lacrimal sac, either clear fluid or a few fibrinous mucoid flakes regurgitate. Dacryo cystography reveals a block in NLD, a normal-sized lacrimal sac with healthy mucosa. Option: B. Stage of lacrimal mucocele : It follows chronic stagnation causing distension of the lacrimal sac. Characteristic features include constant epiphora associated with a swelling just below the inner canthus Dacryo cystography at this stage reveals a distended sac with blockage somewhere in the NLD Option: C. Stage of chronic suppurative dacryocystitis: Due to pyogenic infection, the mucoid discharge becomes purulent, converting the mucocele into \u2018 proceed \u2019. The condition is characterized by epiphora, associated recurrent conjunctivitis, and swelling at the inner canthus with mild erythema of the overlying skin. On regurgitation, a frank purulent discharge flows from the lower punctum. Option: D. Stage of the chronic fibrotic sac. : Low-grade repeated infections for a prolonged period ultimately result in a small fibrotic sac due to the thickening of the mucosa , which is often associated with persistent epiphora and discharge.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>On pathology, there's an accumulation of macrophages and neutrophils Etiology: It is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease with multisystem involvement. It typically occurs in women between 40 and 50 years of age. A characteristic feature is an aqueous deficiency of dry eye-the keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). In primary Sjogren's syndrome patients present with sicca complex-a combination of KCS and xerostomia (dryness of the mouth). In secondary Sjogren's syndrome , dry eye and/or dry mouth are associated with an autoimmune disease, commonly rheumatoid arthritis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Pathological features include focal accumulation and infiltration by lymphocytes and plasma cells with the destruction of lacrimal and salivary glandular tissue.</p>\n<p></p>",
