      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Anemia The third heart sound (S3) is associated with rapid ventricular filling of the left ventricle. S3 is commonly heard in children and young adults and is also heard in conditions when the rapid filling of the ventricle is abnormally high, for example, in anemia or mitral regurgitation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The third heart sound (S3) is a low-frequency/low-pitched, short vibration, it is produced due to the vibrations which set up in the ventricular wall due to the rushing of blood into the ventricles during a rapid filling phase. Clinical Significance of S3: Congestive heart failure is the most common cause of an S3. Any cause of a significant increase in the volume load on the ventricles) can cause an S3. Examples include valvular regurgitation, high-output states (anemia, pregnancy, arteriovenous fistula, or thyrotoxicosis), left-to-right intracardiac shunts, complete A-V block, renal failure, and volume overload from excessive fluids or blood transfusion. Any cause of ventricular dysfunction, including ischemic heart disease, dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, cor-pulmonale, or acute valvular regurgitation, may qualify. Myocardial ischemia without ventricular dysfunction or volume overload is not a cause of an S3.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Bradycardia, generally not associated with S3 Heart sound. Option: C. Mitral Regurgitation, present S3 heart sound not in Mitral stenosis. Option: D. Aortic Regurgitation, S4 present because Left atrial enlargement is there.</p>\n<p></p>",
