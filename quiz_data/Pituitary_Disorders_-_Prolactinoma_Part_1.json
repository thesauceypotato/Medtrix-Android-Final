      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Visceromegaly is not a feature The clinical scenario suggests acromegaly. In acromegaly, Acral bony overgrowth results in frontal bossing, increased hand and foot size, mandibular enlargement with prognathism, and widened space between the lower incisor teeth. Soft tissue swelling results in increased heel pad thickness, increased shoe or glove size, ring tightening, characteristic coarse facial features, and a large fleshy nose. Others include hyperhidrosis, a deep and hollow-sounding voice, oily skin, arthropathy, kyphosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, proximal muscle weakness and fatigue, acanthosis nigricans, and skin tags. Generalized visceromegaly occurs, including cardiomegaly, macroglossia, and thyroid gland enlargement. It can also be associated with increased thickness of jaw bone and also increased size of carpals, metacarpals and phalanges.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. It is associated with excess growth hormone secretion in pituitary adenoma which is the most common cause of acromegaly. Also associated with MEN 1, mccune Albright syndrome, pancreatic islet cell tumour and lymphoma. Option: B. The most significant clinical impact of GH excess occurs with respect to the cardiovascular system. Cardiomyopathy with arrhythmias left ventricular hypertrophy, decreased diastolic function, hypertension ultimately occurs in most patients if untreated. Upper airway obstruction with sleep apnea is associated with both soft tissue laryngeal airway obstruction and central sleep dysfunction. Diabetes mellitus is intolerant to glucose load (as GH counteracts the action of insulin). Acromegaly is associated with an increased risk of colon polyps and mortality from colonic malignancy Option: D. Age-matched serum IGF-1 levels are elevated in acromegaly. The diagnosis of acromegaly is confirmed by demonstrating the failure of GH suppression to <0. 4 \u03bcg/L within 1\u20132 h of an oral glucose load (75 g).</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Primary polydipsia It occurs due to the suppression of AVP secretion by excessive intake of fluids. It is commonly referred to as primary polydipsia and can be subdivided into three subcategories. Dipsogenic DI, the excessive fluid intake appears to be caused by inappropriate thirst. It can occur following head trauma or in association with multifocal diseases of the brain such as neurosarcoid, tuberculous meningitis, and multiple sclerosis Psychogenic polydipsia, is not associated with thirst, and polydipsia seems to be a feature of psychosis or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Latrogenic polydipsia, is due to an increase in water intake motivated by a belief in its health benefits. Brain MRI can be performed to determine if the hyperintense signal normally emitted by the posterior pituitary on T1- weighted images is present. Because this \"bright spot\" is a function of pituitary stores of AVP, it is almost always present in primary polydipsia</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A: In nephrogenic DI, AVP is normal or elevated (>1 pg/mL) and the concurrent urine osmolarity is low (<280 mosm/L). Basal plasma AVP is low or undetectable (<1 pg/mL), and nephrogenic DI is very unlikely. The bright spot is also faint or absent in nephrogenic DI presumably because the chronic stimulus to AVP secretion depletes pituitary stores of the hormone. Option C: It occurs due to a deficiency of AVP caused by an increased rate of degradation by an N-terminal aminopeptidase produced in the placenta. It is referred to as gestational DI because the signs and symptoms manifest during pregnancy and usually remit several weeks after delivery. Option D: Brain MRI can be performed to determine if the hyperintense signal normally emitted by the posterior pituitary on T1-weighted images, \"bright spot\" t is abnormally small or absent in pituitary DI even when the deficiency in AVP is partial or due to production of a biologically inactive form of the hormone</p>\n<p></p>",
