The ampulla of Vater is intubated, and contrast is injected into the biliary and pancreatic ducts to display the anatomy radiologically. In pancreatic carcinoma, the main pancreatic duct may be narrowed or completely obstructed at the site of the tumor, or the distal bile duct may be narrowed. Concurrent narrowing of both ducts results in the so-called double duct sign.

The majority of PDAC cases occur in the head of the pancreas, with a smaller percentage occurring in the body and tail. Management: More than 85% of patients with ductal adenocarcinoma have advanced disease and are not suitable for resection. If imaging shows a potentially resectable tumor , surgical resection should be considered as it offers the only chance of a cure, albeit a small one. For patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease , the primary objective should be to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, and extend survival, rather than achieving a cure. Patients with pancreatic cancer fall into four categories: resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced and unresectable, and metastatic. Resectable patients should be offered surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Borderline resectable patients may be offered neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without chemoradiotherapy, followed by surgical resection if the disease has been downstaged. Adjuvant therapy should follow. Locally advanced and unresectable patient s should be offered systemic chemotherapy , with surgery being a possibility in a small cohort who get downstaged. Metastatic patients should be offered systemic chemotherapy. If a cystic tumor is encountered, regardless of size, surgical resection should be considered as it carries a reasonable chance of cure.

Numerous scoring systems can be used to help predict the severity and prognosis of patients with acute pancreatitis (e.g., Ranson criteria ). The Ranson criteria use the change in hematocrit over time as a key prognostic factor. Because acute pancreatitis causes significant third space volume loss, patients often present with hemoconcentration, which is indicated by an elevated hematocrit at the time of admission. The fall in hematocrit after the administration of IV fluids over 48 hours is an indicator of the severity of third-spacing at admission, and therefore, an indication of the severity of pancreatitis overall. Hematocrit can also be used in isolation; the American College of Gastroenterology considers a hematocrit > 44% as an indicator for a severe course. Additional parameters of the Ranson criteria include glucose > 200 mg/dL, age > 55, LDH > 350 U/L, AST > 250 U/L, WBC > 16,000/mm3, at admission, and a fall in hematocrit by \u2265 10%, increase in BUN of \u2265 5 mg/dL, calcium < 8 mg/dL, pO2 < 60 mm Hg, base deficit > 4 MEq/L, and fluid sequestration > 6 L after 48 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Early identification of severe pancreatitis is essential for aggressive early management and potential transfer to a specialized unit. Severe attacks are characterized by a deteriorating physiological state and an initial impression of a very ill patient within 24-48 hours. Various prognostic scoring systems, such as Ranson and Glasgow , are used to predict persistent organ failure, particularly respiratory, cardiac, and renal. Severity assessments should be performed 24 hours, 48 hours, and 7 days after admission. Persisting organ failure indicates severity, regardless of the scoring system used. A serum C-reactive protein level >150 mg/L at 48 hours after symptom onset and a body mass index >30 indicate higher risks of complications.

Although individual AST and ALT values are used in some scoring systems for predicting the severity of pancreatitis (e.g, AST in Ranson criteria), the AST/ALT ratio is not used to assess the severity of pancreatitis. The AST/ALT ratio is commonly used to determine the etiology of a hepatocellular injury. However, the values of both AST and ALT are within normal limits, which suggests that the patient does not have hepatocellular injury. Option: D. Alkaline phosphatase levels may be elevated in gallstone pancreatitis; however, it is not associated with increased severity of the disease. In addition, the patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption and low-risk profile for cholelithiasis (not female, not obese) make gallstone pancreatitis less likely.</p>\n<p></p>",

A hypercoagulable state may either result from inherited gene mutations or insufficient inhibitors of the coagulation cascade, both of which this patient does not have. However, the Whipple procedure involves resection of the first part of the jejunum, which is responsible for the absorption of vitamin K. This may contribute to the development of coagulopathy due to a deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Option: C. Calcium absorption is mediated through active transport and passive diffusion with the greatest amount being absorbed in the duodenum. When this patient's duodenum is removed, she will have diminished intestinal calcium uptake, which leads to increased reabsorption of calcium in the kidney to maintain normal serum levels. As a result, urinary calcium is low, which decreases the likelihood of calcium oxalate stone formation. Option: D. The finding of wide-based gait is commonly associated with long-standing vitamin B12 deficiency , which leads to diminished proprioception in the lower extremities. Common causes of B12 deficiency include pernicious anemia, malnutrition, or gastrectomy. A Whipple procedure, as described in this case, would not alter vitamin B12 absorption as this vitamin is absorbed in the terminal ileum. Moreover, intrinsic factor (IF) function would also remain unaffected despite this patient's distal gastrectomy, because IF is produced by the parietal cells of the stomach (located in the gastric cardia and fundus).</p>\n<p></p>",

This patient presents with clinical features of acute pancreatitis supported by laboratory evidence. After IV hydration, the next step is to evaluate the cause to plan further treatment and prevent a recurrence. The most common cause of acute pancreatitis in the United States is biliary pancreatitis. Abdominal ultrasonography is a highly sensitive imaging modality for detecting gallstones in the biliary and pancreatic duct and should be performed in all patients presenting with acute pancreatitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Acute pancreatitis (AP) is mild and self-limited in most patients, but 10-20% of patients may experience a rapidly progressive inflammatory response associated with a prolonged hospital stay, significant morbidity, and mortality. Severe pancreatitis has a mortality rate of 10-30% and is often caused by multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and septic complications. AP results from abnormal pancreatic enzyme activation , leading to autodigestion of pancreatic tissue and triggering an inflammatory response. Gallstones and ethanol abuse are the most common risk factors for AP. Clinical features include: epigastric pain, nausea/vomiting, and dehydration; severe cases may exhibit abdominal distention and rebound tenderness. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and elevated pancreatic enzyme levels, with lipase being a more specific marker than amylase. Treatment involves aggressive fluid resuscitation, analgesics, and enteral nutrition.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is not indicated for suspected acute pancreatitis but in patients > 55 years of age with suspected peptic ulcer disease or those with any alarm symptoms (i.e., weight loss, anemia, hematemesis, dysphagia). Although PUD typically causes epigastric pain, as seen in this patient, the pain is usually insidious in onset, intermittent, exacerbated by meals, and does not radiate to the back. The examination would not show epigastric guarding unless there was a perforation, in which case guarding would be diffuse and be accompanied by rebound tenderness. Option: B. An abdominal CECT scan is indicated for suspected acute pancreatitis only when the diagnosis is uncertain (e.g., minimally elevated pancreatic enzymes, non-specific symptoms) or if there are suspected complications such as necrotizing pancreatitis or pancreatic abscess (e.g., persistent fever and leukocytosis, no clinical improvement or evidence of organ failure > 48\u201372 hours of therapy).

Alcohol use disorder is the most common etiology of chronic pancreatitis, accounting for 60\u201370% of cases. Diagnosis is confirmed on abdominal CT imaging, which can show pancreatic calcifications, ductal strictures, and ductal dilatation. A \u201cchain of lakes\u201d appearance can sometimes be seen, which is caused by the alternating dilation and stricture of the main pancreatic duct.

Option: C. Acute chest pain radiating to the back (or thorax, or abdomen) in the context of a hypertensive male smoker should raise concern for aortic dissection. Nausea, vomiting, and hemodynamic instability such as tachycardia and hypertension (or hypotension if ruptured) can be seen. However, aortic dissection would not explain this patient's largely epigastric pain and elevated amylase and lipase. Option: D. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) can also present with epigastric pain and nausea. Smoking and alcohol are risk factors for PUD.

Patients with CP develop progressive pancreatic inflammation that causes non-reversible exocrine and endocrine functional damage . Diarrhea, steatorrhea, and weight loss can develop due to fat malabsorption from reduced levels of exocrine pancreatic enzymes (eg, amylase, protease, lipase}.

Trypsinogen is normally inhibited and destroyed by SPINK1 if it becomes activated prematurely within the pancreas. Hereditary pancreatitis is an autosomal dominant disorder with an 80% penetrance and is associated with a gain-of-function mutation in the cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1) on chromosome 7, which leads to the production of a degradation-resistant form of trypsin. A loss-of-function mutation in SPINK1 is also linked to idiopathic pancreatitis. Some patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis have mutations in the CFTR gene. Idiopathic chronic pancreatitis accounts for about 30% of cases and is divided into early-onset and late-onset forms.

Serum cancer-associated antigen (CA) 19-9 levels are elevated in pancreatic cancer, which usually presents with abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice. However, CA 19-9 levels should not be used to diagnose suspected pancreatic cancer (due to limited sensitivity and specificity). An abdominal CT scan is usually the first step. Option: D.

Pancreatic carcinoma most commonly presents with dull upper abdominal pain that radiates to the back, weight loss, or jaundice. Those tumors located in the pancreatic body or tail are most likely to present with pain and weight loss, while those tumors located in the pancreatic head are most likely to present with steatorrhea, weight loss, and jaundice. Physical examination is often unremarkable aside from jaundice, with an abdominal mass or ascites present in only 20% of patients with pancreatic cancer. Classic findings include a non-tender but palpable gallbladder at the right costal margin in a jaundiced patient (Courvoisier s sign) or left supraclavicular adenopathy (Virchow node) in a patient with metastatic disease. Laboratory evaluation of those with pancreatic cancer typically demonstrates increased serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase in conjunction with mild anemia. Abdominal ultrasound is usually the initial imaging performed on patients with jaundice. When the ultrasound is nondiagnostic (as in this case), the next step is to obtain an abdominal CT scan. This imaging modality has a sensitivity and specificity of 85-90% and 90-95%, respectively, for the imaging of pancreatic cancer. Commonly, a CT scan is effective in detecting bile and pancreatic duct dilation, mass lesions within the pancreas, and indications of extrahepatic spread (eg, metastases or ascites).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Carcinoma Pancreas is a type of cancer that originates in the pancreas, with the most common type being pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The majority of PDAC cases occur in the head of the pancreas, with a smaller percentage occurring in the body and tail. Management: More than 85% of patients with ductal adenocarcinoma have advanced disease and are not suitable for resection. If imaging shows a potentially resectable tumor , surgical resection should be considered as it offers the only chance of a cure, albeit a small one. For patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease , the primary objective should be to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, and extend survival, rather than achieving a cure. Patients with pancreatic cancer fall into four categories: resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced and unresectable, and metastatic. Resectable patients should be offered surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Borderline resectable patients may be offered neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without chemoradiotherapy, followed by surgical resection if the disease has been downstaged. Adjuvant therapy should follow. Locally advanced and unresectable patient s should be offered systemic chemotherapy , with surgery being a possibility in a small cohort who get downstaged. Metastatic patients should be offered systemic chemotherapy. If a cystic tumor is encountered, regardless of size, surgical resection should be considered as it carries a reasonable chance of cure.

Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC) is an invasive procedure in which a needle is inserted into a dilated bile duct for opacification. PTC is used in the evaluation of patients who have previously identified biliary tract dilation but are not candidates for ERCP.

The diagnosis of ZES is made by measuring the serum gastrin level, but patients must stop taking proton pump inhibitors for accurate testing. Other conditions can cause elevated gastrin levels, including pernicious anemia, treatment with proton pump inhibitors, renal failure, G-cell hyperplasia, atrophic gastritis, retained or excluded antrum, and gastric outlet obstruction. In equivocal cases, a secretin stimulation test may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of ZES.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

Although the patient presents with a decreased calcium level, none of the criteria for calcium gluconate therapy are present at this time. Option: C. Fomepizole therapy is typically indicated in patients with ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning. Ethylene glycol poisoning may manifest with signs of acute kidney injury, such as the elevated BUN and creatinine seen in this patient. However, patients with ethylene glycol toxicity typically present with altered mental status, hallucinations, flank pain, and dyspnea, none of which are seen here. Improper distillation of spirits can cause methanol poisoning and this patient's occupation might put him at risk. While methanol intoxication can also cause abdominal pain and nausea, it usually presents with headache, altered mental status, and visual disturbances, which are absent here.</p>\n<p></p>",

The most common symptom of pancreatic cancer is unexplained weight loss, which is not seen in this patient. Option: D. Cholangitis refers to inflammation of the bile duct most commonly due to ascending infection from the duodenum. Acute cholangitis after undergoing cholecystectomy, as this patient did, is uncommon but can occur because of a retained stone in the bile duct.

Excess glucagon increases gluconeogenesis and inhibits glycolysis, causing hyperglycemia and/or mild diabetes. Anemia may be a result of anemia or chronic illness or directly related to the inhibitory effect of glucagon on erythropoiesis. As seen here, patients with glucagonoma can also present with neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, dementia, and ataxia). Necrolytic migratory erythema is characterized by the occurrence of multiple, centrifugally spreading erythemas, located predominantly on the face, perineum, and lower extremities, which develop into painful and pruritic crusty patches with central areas of bronze-colored induration.

Patients with the celiac disease commonly experience abdominal cramps and depression. However, hyperglycemia is not a typical finding. Option: B. Severely decreased serum zinc levels are typically found in zinc uptake deficiency (e.g., in acrodermatitis enteropathica), which can also present with chronic diarrhea and anemia. However, neither the hereditary form (manifests at a young age with failure to thrive) nor the acquired form (secondary to celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease) is associated with hyperglycemia.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Rotation of ventral pancreatic bud During the embryologic development of the pancreas, the endoderm forms two buds: a ventral and a dorsal one. In the process of foregut rotation, the ventral pancreatic bud normally fuses with the dorsal pancreatic bud. A defect in this process can lead to the fusion of abnormally rotated buds, resulting in a ring of pancreatic tissue surrounding the duodenum ( annular pancreas ) and duodenal stenosis. In the antenatal period, this manifests as polyhydramnios, and in the neonatal period, it manifests as feeding intolerance, vomiting (typically non-bilious, but can be bilious depending on whether the obstruction is proximal or distal to the major duodenal papilla), and abdominal distension. The annular pancreas is associated with Down syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The annular pancreas is characterized by a circumferential or near-circumferential band of pancreas tissue that surrounds the second part of the duodenum, typically of ventral pancreas origin and usually proximal to the ampulla. In 40% of cases, duodenal stenosis or atresia can be present at the site of the annulus. The annular pancreas is more common in individuals with Down's syndrome (trisomy 21), occurring in 15-25% of cases. This condition is often associated with other congenital anomalies, such as intestinal malrotation, tracheoesophageal fistula, congenital heart defects, Meckel's diverticulum, and imperforate anus.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. A defect in the lateral septation of the foregut into the esophagus and trachea is the mechanism behind esophageal atresia. Esophageal atresia can lead to polyhydramnios due to the fetus's inability to swallow and would also present with feeding difficulties and non-bilious vomiting after birth. However, other symptoms such as excessive drooling, choking, and respiratory distress would also be expected. Furthermore, X-ray would show an airless abdomen, not a double bubble sign. Option: C. Failure of migration of neural crest cells (precursors of enteric ganglion cells) to the distal colon during embryonic development causes Hirschsprung disease. Hirschsprung disease is also associated with Down\u2019s syndrome and classically presents with abdominal distention and vomiting. However, bilious vomiting would be expected rather than non-bilious vomiting, as would failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours after birth. A double bubble sign would not be present on X-ray. Option: D. Incomplete duodenal recanalization during weeks eight to ten of embryonic development leads to duodenal atresia. Duodenal atresia is associated with Down\u2019s syndrome and would also present with feeding difficulties, distension of the abdomen, and the double bubble sign on X-ray. However, bilious vomiting would be expected, rather than the non-bilious vomiting seen here. Furthermore, delayed meconium passage would also be seen, which is not the case in this patient.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Definitive diagnosis can be made through endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

The overall damage can be from simple contusion or laceration to major parenchymal and duct destruction; in extreme cases, there may be massive destruction of the pancreatic head where inevitably concomitant duodenal injury will be present.

For patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease , the primary objective should be to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, and extend survival, rather than achieving a cure. Patients with pancreatic cancer fall into four categories: resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced and unresectable, and metastatic. Resectable patients should be offered surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Borderline resectable patients may be offered neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without chemoradiotherapy, followed by surgical resection if the disease has been downstaged. Adjuvant therapy should follow. Locally advanced and unresectable patient s should be offered systemic chemotherapy , with surgery being a possibility in a small cohort who get downstaged. Metastatic patients should be offered systemic chemotherapy. If a cystic tumor is encountered, regardless of size, surgical resection should be considered as it carries a reasonable chance of cure.
