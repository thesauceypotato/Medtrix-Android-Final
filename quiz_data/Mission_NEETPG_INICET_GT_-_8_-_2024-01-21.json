There is an increased risk of major congenital malformations due to AEDs. However, certain AEDS like lamotrigine, levetiracetam and carbamazepine are commonly used and considered the safest agents. Poly-therapy increases the risk of malformations. Sodium valproate infers the highest risk of congenital malformations (especially Neural tube defects). Increased risk of Fetal growth restriction in women on AEDs. There is an increased risk of developing childhood epilepsy in the fetus. Folic acid (5mg) should be taken pre conceptionally and throughout pregnancy to reduce the risk of congenital malformations and long-term cognitive effects. Aim for monotherapy with the longest effective AED dose if possible.
