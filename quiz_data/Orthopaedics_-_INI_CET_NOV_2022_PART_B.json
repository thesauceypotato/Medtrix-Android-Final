This appearance is typically seen in Giant cell tumour of the bone/ osteoclastoma. It's a locally aggressive tumour composed of giant cells that arise from the bone marrow. Peak incidence is seen in 20 - 40 years of age GCT is most commonly seen in the distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus, and distal radius.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Important x ray features of a GCT: A solitary ,possibly loculated,lytic lesion in the epiphysis Eccentric location,most often subchondral Expansion of the overlying cortex Soap bubble appearance-The tumor is homogeneously lytic with trabeculae of the remnants of bone traversing it,giving it a loculated appearance called soap bubble appearance No calcification within the tumor No or minimal reactive sclerosis around the tumor Common presenting complaints are swelling, vague pain and limited range of motion. The patient may present with a pathological fracture of the lesion Treatment includes curettage and bone grafting or en-bloc resection to minimise recurrence rate. Bisphosphonates can be used to decrease the proliferation of osteoclasts and therefore stabilise the tumour. Radiation can also be used.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA RADIOLOGICAL APPEARANCE TUMORS SUNRAY APPEARANCE /CODMAN\u2019S TRIANGLE OSTEOSARCOMA BUT CAN BE SEEN IN ANY MALIGNANT CONDITION SOAP BUBBLE APPEARANCE GIANT CELL TUMOR ONION PEEL APPEARANCE EWING\u2019S SARCOMA BUT CAN BE SEEN IN ANY MALIGNANT TUMOR GROUND GLASS APPEARANCE/ SHEPHERD'S CROOK DEFORMITY FIBROUS DYSPLASIA HOMOGENOUS CALCIFICATION OSTEOGENIC TUMORS FALLEN FRAGMENT SIGN/TRAP DOOR SIGN SIMPLE BONE CYST POLKA DOT SIGN VERTEBRAL HEMANGIOMA MOTH EATEN BONE MULTIPLE MYELOMA WINKING OWL SIGN VERTEBRAL METASTASIS DOUBLE DENSITY SIGN ANEURYSMAL BONE CYST PUNCTATE CALCIFICATION CHONDROBLASTOMA POPCORN CALCIFICATION CHONDROSARCOMA PATCHY CALCIFICATION CHONDROSARCOMA AND CHONDROBLASTOMA</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Lumbar canal stenosis (LCS) The given clinical scenario is suggestive of lumbar canal stenosis. Lumbar stenosis is a condition in which there is direct pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots, along with vascular obstruction and ischemic neuropathy during hyperextension of the lumbar spine, it occurs due to the narrowing of the spinal canal of the lumbar vertebrae.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is commonly used to describe patients with symptoms related to anatomical reduction of the lumbar spinal size . It commonly occurs due to degenerative changes in older individuals. The clinical symptoms include weakness, aching or paresthesia in the lower limbs especially on walking. Pain is relieved by walking uphill, sitting or crouching.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A:Osteoporotic Vertebral Compression Fractures are very common fragility fractures of the spine that affect up to 50% of people over 80 years old. Diagnosis can be made with lateral radiographs. Determining the acuity of a fracture requires an MRI or bones scan. Treatment is usually observation and pain management. Kyphoplasty is reserved for patients with recalcitrant symptoms after nonoperative treatment for 4-6 weeks fails. Assessment and management of osteoporosis is indicated in the presence of these injuries. OPTION C: Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls. This buildup is called plaque. The plaque can cause arteries to narrow, blocking blood flow. The plaque can also burst, leading to a blood clot. OPTION D: Thromboangiitis obliterans , also known as Buerger disease or Winiwarter-Buerger disease , is a recurring progressive inflammation and thrombosis (clotting) of small and medium arteries and veins of the hands and feet. It is strongly associated with use of tobacco products, primarily from smoking, but is also associated with smokeless tobacco.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA IMPORTANT STRUCTURES IN SPINAL CORD STRUCTURE/SPACE TERMINAL EXTENT SPINAL CORD AT BIRTH L3 UPPER BORDER SPINAL CORD AT 2 YEARS L1 UPPER BORDER ADULT SPINAL CORD L1 LOWER BORDER FILUM TERMINALE 1ST COCCYGEAL SEGMENT FILUM TERMINALE,DURAL SAC S2 LOWER BORDER FILUM TERMINALE EXTERNUM 1ST COCCYGEAL SEGMENT PIAMATER 1ST COCCYGEAL SEGMENT SUBARACHNOID SHEATH AND SPACE,SUBDURAL SPACE S2 LOWER BORDER CERVICAL ENLARGEMENT C3-T2 SPINAL SEGMENTS LUMBAR ENLARGEMENT L1-S3 SPINAL SEGMENTS</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>4 Emergency management of open fractures is mainly focussed on the prevention of infection by providing antibiotic coverage and splinting. Reduction of the fracture can be done in the emergency room. Internal fixation is a part of definitive management and is done after the patient is stabilized To manage open fractures in an emergency setting, the main objectives are to prevent infection through antibiotics and splinting. Fracture reduction may be performed, but internal fixation is deferred until the patient is stabilised</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The management of open fractures includes several key components: Prompt administration of antibiotic prophylaxis Early debridement of the wound and fracture, including excision of wound margins, removal of devitalized tissue, and thorough cleansing to remove foreign material Consideration of nerve and tendon repair in clean wounds Wound coverage , which may be done early in Gustilo Type I and II fractures, but is usually delayed in Type III fractures Fracture stabilisation using external fixators in the emergency room, with definitive management by open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) performed later.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option  B,C ,D is not the correct answer</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Open Fractures are classified based on Gustilo Anderson classification .
