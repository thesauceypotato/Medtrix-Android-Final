The hyoid bone is not part of the larynx, though the larynx is suspended from the hyoid. The larynx extends vertically from the tip of the epiglottis to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage.

Transverse arytenoid muscle adducts the arytenoid cartilages, resulting in adducted vocal cords. Oblique arytenoid muscles narrow the laryngeal inlet by constricting the distance between the arytenoid cartilages. Thyroarytenoid muscles narrow the laryngeal inlet, shortening the vocal cords, and lowering voice pitch.
