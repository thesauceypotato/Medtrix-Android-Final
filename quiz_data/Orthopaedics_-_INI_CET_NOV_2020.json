      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Milwaukee Brace A Milwaukee brace is used in the treatment of postural disorders like idiopathic scoliosis. The brace is normally prescribed for children, with a postural disorder, who have not reached their growth spurt or who are in their fast growing period. It is not used for adults or adolescents already beyond their growth spurt, as it will have no effect. It is especially recommended in cases where there is fear of deterioration during the growth spurt of adolescents. If the spinal curve has a Cobb angle between 20\u00b0 and 40\u00b0, it is an indication to use a brace.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A.

This straightforward technique is useful for performing acute decompression in patients with partial neurological deficits and multisystem injuries. Monoaxial pedicle screws are placed in the vertebra below the fracture, and thinner polyaxial screws are placed in the vertebra above the fracture. The screws are connected with rods, and distraction is performed. A laminectomy allows for placement of a stiffer fixation system, and it improves the insufficient canal clearance obtained when performing annulotaxis alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - OPTION A. Spinous process The spinous processes are short and often bifurcated (the spinous process of C7, however, is not bifurcated, and is substantially longer than that of the other cervical spinous processes).

The lamina is often the site of back surgery when you need to relieve the symptoms caused by pressure on the spinal nerve roots 3 .

DXA provides the patient\u2019s T-score, which is the BMD value compared with that of control subjects who are at their peak BMD. World Health Organization (WHO) criteria define a normal T-score value as within 1 standard deviation (SD) of the mean BMD value in a healthy young adult. Values lying farther from the mean are stratified as follows : T-score of \u20131 to \u20132.5 SD indicates osteopenia T-score of less than \u20132.5 SD indicates osteoporosis T-score of less than \u20132.5 SD with fragility fracture(s) indicates severe osteoporosis DXA also provides the patient\u2019s Z-score, which reflects a value compared with that of persons matched for age and sex. Z-scores adjusted for ethnicity or race should be used in the following patients: Premenopausal women Men younger than 50 years Children Z-score values of \u20132.0 SD or lower are defined as \"below the expected range for age\" and those above \u20132.0 SD as \"within the expected range for age.\" The diagnosis of osteoporosis in these groups should not be based on densitometric criteria alone. If bone density testing is not available, vertebral imaging may be considered based on age alone. #CLINICAL EDGE: Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement is recommended in the following patients : Women age 65 years and older and men age 70 years and older, regardless of clinical risk factors Postmenopausal women and men above age 50\u201369, younger postmenopausal women and women in menopausal transition based on risk factor profile Postmenopausal women and men age 50 and older who have had an adult-age fracture, to diagnose and determine the degree of osteoporosis Adults with a condition (eg, rheumatoid arthritis) or taking medication (eg, glucocorticoids in a daily dose \u22655 mg prednisone or equivalent for \u22653 months) associated with low bone mass or bone loss</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#Mantra Bone mineral density graph</p>\n<p></p>",
