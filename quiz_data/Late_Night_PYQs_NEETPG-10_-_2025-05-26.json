Small fistulas can heal spontaneously; however, most established fistulas require surgical repair. The surgical repair is usually performed vaginally after approximately 3 months to allow inflammation to subside. Post-operatively, continuous bladder drainage for 14 days along with antibiotics is recommended to facilitate healing. Following VVF repair, it is recommended that the patient abstain from sexual activity for 3 months to allow the surgical site to heal properly and avoid complications. Additionally, pregnancy should be avoided for a year to ensure the integrity and strength of the repair before subjecting the area to the stresses of pregnancy and childbirth.</li><li>\u2022 Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) is a type of urinary fistula that commonly arises due to obstetric trauma.</li><li>\u2022 Small fistulas can heal spontaneously; however, most established fistulas require surgical repair.</li><li>\u2022 The surgical repair is usually performed vaginally after approximately 3 months to allow inflammation to subside.</li><li>\u2022 Post-operatively, continuous bladder drainage for 14 days along with antibiotics is recommended to facilitate healing.</li><li>\u2022 Following VVF repair, it is recommended that the patient abstain from sexual activity for 3 months to allow the surgical site to heal properly and avoid complications.</li><li>\u2022 Additionally, pregnancy should be avoided for a year to ensure the integrity and strength of the repair before subjecting the area to the stresses of pregnancy and childbirth.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Sexual abstinence for 3 weeks and avoid pregnancy for 6 months</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Sexual abstinence for 6 weeks and avoid pregnancy for a year : While the recommendation to avoid pregnancy for a year is appropriate, 6 weeks of sexual abstinence may still be insufficient for optimal healing of the fistula repair.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Sexual abstinence for 6 weeks and avoid pregnancy for a year</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Sexual abstinence for 6 months and avoid pregnancy for 6 years : This recommendation is excessively long.

It is specifically designed to detect and measure recruitment in unilateral sensorineural hearing loss.

It relies on the principle that people unconsciously raise their voice when they cannot hear themselves speak.

It employs tuning forks that appear identical but vibrate at different frequencies.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. C. Becomes more positive</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 In the given clinical scenario, the patient has hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can cause a shift in the resting membrane potential towards a more positive value, increased cell excitability, and impairments in membrane potential changes.</li><li>\u2022 Hyperkalemia can affect the resting membrane potential of cells, including neurons and muscle cells, in the following ways:</li><li>\u2022 Increased Resting Membrane Potential: Normally, the resting membrane potential is around -70 millivolts (mV) in neurons. However, in hyperkalemia, the elevated extracellular potassium concentration can lead to an increased positive charge outside the cell. This positive charge tends to depolarize the cell membrane, shifting the resting membrane potential towards a more positive value. Altered Excitability: The increased resting membrane potential caused by hyperkalemia can make the cell more excitable. It reduces the threshold required for an action potential to be initiated, making the cell more likely to depolarize and generate an action potential even in response to weaker stimuli. Impaired Membrane Potential Changes: Hyperkalemia can interfere with the ability of the cell membrane to depolarize and repolarize properly during an action potential. It reduces the electrochemical gradient for sodium (Na+) entry during depolarization and decreases the driving force for potassium (K+) exit during repolarization. This can result in slower and less efficient propagation of action potentials. Disrupted Ionic Balance: Elevated potassium levels can disrupt the balance of other ions, such as sodium and calcium, which are essential for normal cell function. The altered ionic balance can interfere with the proper functioning of ion channels and other membrane proteins involved in generating and regulating action potentials.</li><li>\u2022 Increased Resting Membrane Potential: Normally, the resting membrane potential is around -70 millivolts (mV) in neurons.

No change: Incorrect. Changes in extracellular potassium concentrations directly impact the resting membrane potential.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. No change:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

An increase in extracellular potassium concentration results in depolarization (more positive resting membrane potential), not hyperpolarization.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Becomes more negative:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. First becomes more positive, then negative: Incorrect. While complex fluctuations can occur under dynamic conditions, primarily, hyperkalemia causes a persistent depolarization (more positive shift) without an initial opposite change.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

This can affect the normal function of these cells, potentially leading to complications such as muscle weakness or cardiac arrhythmias.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
