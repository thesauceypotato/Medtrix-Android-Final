      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>RET The loss of function mutation of the RET gene is responsible for the majority of cases of Hirschsprung's disease. RET is a proto-oncogene that plays a crucial role in the development of the enteric nervous system , which controls the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Mutations in RET can lead to abnormal migration or differentiation of the ENS precursor cells during fetal development, resulting in the absence or reduction of ganglion cells in the distal colon and rectum. This leads to a functional obstruction of the affected bowel segment, causing symptoms such as constipation, abdominal distension, and vomiting.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hirschsprung disease Aka congenital aganglionic megacolon Autosomal dominant inheritance More common in males than females Cause: Loss of function mutation of the RET gene leading to failure of migration of neural crest cells during embryonic development, resulting in an absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon.

Risk factors: Smoking tobacco, excessive alcohol consumption, hot beverage consumption, and a diet lacking in fruits and vegetables. Cause: Amplification of the transcription factor gene SOX2 ; overexpression of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1; and loss-of-function mutations in the tumour suppressors TP53, E-cadherin, and NOTCH1.

Adenocarcinoma: It is more commonly associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett's esophagus. Option: B. Carcinoid tumour: These are rare neuroendocrine tumours that can develop in various organs of the body, including the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and liver. In the esophagus, carcinoid tumours are extremely rare. Option: D.
