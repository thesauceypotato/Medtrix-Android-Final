      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All of the above Stridor is a high-pitched musical breath sound resulting from the turbulent airflow in the larynx or bronchi. Stridor is a physical sign which is caused by a narrowed or obstructed airway. It can be inspiratory, expiratory, or biphasic. Inspiratory stridor often occurs in croup. It may be serious airway obstruction from severe conditions like epiglottitis and foreign bodies obstruction. Stridor should always command attention to establish its cause.</p>\n<p></p>",
