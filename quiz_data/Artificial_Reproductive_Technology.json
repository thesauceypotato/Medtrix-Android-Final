Image shows the tobacco pouch appearance in HSG.WHICH is seen in genital TB THE IOC here will be an endometrial biopsy . And Treatment will be ATT and IVF. Zygote intrafallopian transfer is not used to treat her infertility as her tubal cilia undergo irreversible damage. IVF will be indicated in her.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Zygote Intrafallopian Transfer (Zift) Zygote intrafallopian transfer was first described by Devroey et al. (1986). The placement of the zygote (following one day of in vitro fertilization ) into the fallopian tube can be done either through the abdominal ostium by laparoscope or through the uterine ostium under ultrasonic guidance. This technique is a suitable alternative to GIFT when the defect lies in the male factor or in cases of failed GIFT. Results (29\u201330%) are similar to that of IVF. GIFT or ZIFT is avoided when tubal factors for infertility are present . The risk of ectopic pregnancy is high for GIFT and ZIFT compared to IVF.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - All other options are true. Option A.
