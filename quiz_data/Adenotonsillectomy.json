Since there is impaired hearing, it means the child has developed otitis media as a complication. Hence logically, the child should be treated with adenoidectomy with grommet insertion. The following lines from Scott Brown further support this. \u201cCurrent practice is to perform adenoidectomy as an adjunct to insert ventilation tubes.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>",
