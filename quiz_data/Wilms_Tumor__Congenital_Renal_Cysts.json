Approximately 6% of all childhood cancer is Wilms tumors with a peak incidence at 2-3 years of age. individuals with horseshoe kidneys have a higher risk of Wilms tumor.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Most patients present with an asymptomatic abdominal mass detected by their parents or physician during a routine examination. Features at diagnosis include hematuria(10-25%), hypertension (25%), and abdominal pain (.3-0\"). fever (20%), anorexia, and vomiting. Wilms.' Turner should be considered in any child with abdominal mass... Tumor thrombus extending into the inferior vena cava is found in 4-10%. Other features of the presentation include anemia. thrombocytosis, acquired deficiency of von 'Willebrand factor and factor VII, and polycythemia. Differential Diagnosis includes neuroblastoma and other flank masses including hydronephrosis, multicystic kidney, and rarely abdominal lymphoma and retroperitoneal rhabdomyosarcoma. Features of associated syndromes may be present in 10-20%. NEUROBLASTOMA- Signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma vary with the site of presentation. Generally, symptoms include abdominal pain, emesis, weight loss, anorexia, fatigue, and bone pain. Hypertension is an uncommon sign of the disease and is generally caused by renal artery compression, not catecholamine excess. Chronic diarrhea is a rare presenting symptom secondary to tumor secretion of vasoactive intestinal peptide secretion. Nephroblastoma is another name for Wilms tumor. Angiomyolipoma is usually presented in the hood.</p>\n<p></p>",
