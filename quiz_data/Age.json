An upright is set at one end of the board, and a second one slides along the board. The bone is placed with one of its ends against the fixed upright, and the movable upright is brought up to the other end of the bone. The distance between the uprights is then shown on the ruler. Hepburn osteometric board modified by Trevor is commonly used. If an osteometric board is unavailable, the bones should be measured on a flat bench with the maximum lengths taken between two vertical, parallel panels placed in contact with the bone ends. If the bones are covered with articular cartilage, subtract for radius and humerus 3 mm. each, the tibia 5 mm. and the femur 7 mm before applying the formulae for stature estimation. Weight-bearing long bones are used for applying these formulae. Femur and tibia give more accurate results than the humerus or radius. The average stature obtained from measuring more than one long bone gives a more precise result than when calculated for a single bone. Right-side bones usually are measured in a dry state without cartilage. The results could be more accurate, and the error may be up to 2.5 cm. Measurements of the femur, tibia, humerus, and radius are helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. foot measuring board/shoe measuring board Option: C.

Other criteria of Gustafson\u2019s method are secondary dentine deposition and cementum apposition.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Attrition: Due to wear and tear from chewing, the occlusal (upper) surface of99+ the teeth is gradually destroyed, first involving the enamel, then dentin, and at last, the pulp is exposed in old age. It depends on the practical use of teeth and also on the hardness of the enamel. Option: B. Periodontosis: Regression of the gums and periodontal tissues surrounding the teeth takes place in advancing age, gradually exposing the necks and the adjacent part of roots. The teeth become loose and fall off. Poor oral hygiene increases periodontosis. There may be deposition of hardened debris which occurs gradually over a long period. Secondary dentin: It may develop from the walls within the pulp cavity and decrease the size of the cavity. First,, it is deposited at the pulp chamber, gradually extending downwards to the apex, and may fill the pulp cavity. This is partly due to aging and partly due to pathological conditions like caries and periodontosis. Cementum apposition: The cementum increases in thickness mainly due to changes in the tooth position, especially near the end of the root. Secondary cementum is slowly and continuously deposited throughout life and forms incremental lines. Incremental lines appear as cross-striations on the enamel of teeth due to cementum apposition and are thought to represent daily growth increments. They can be seen in the histological section. The age can be calculated by counting the number of lines from the neonatal line onward. This is mainly applicable to infants. Option: C: Root resorption: It involves both cementum and dentin, which show characteristically sharp grooves. Absorption of the root starts first at the apex and extends upwards. It usually occurs at late age. It may be due to a pathological processes.</p>\n<p></p>",
