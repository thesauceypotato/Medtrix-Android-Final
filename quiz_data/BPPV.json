Otosclerosis, more aptly called otospongiosis, is a primary disease of the bony labyrinth. In this, one or more foci of irregularly laid spongy bone replace part of the normally dense enchondral layer of the bony otic capsule. Option B- Tympanosclerosis is hyalinization and later calcification in the fibrous layer of the tympanic membrane. It appears as a chalky white plaque. Mostly, it remains asymptomatic. It is frequently seen in cases of serous otitis media as a complication of a ventilation tube. Option D- Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a long-standing infection of a part or whole of the middle ear cleft characterized by ear discharge and a permanent perforation.</p>\n<p></p>",
