      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Leprosy Neuronal involvement dominates tuberculoid leprosy . Nerves become enclosed within granulomatous inflammatory reactions and, if small (e.g. the peripheral twigs), are destroyed. Nerve degeneration causes skin anesthesias and skin and muscle atrophy that render the person liable to the trauma of the affected parts, leading to the development of chronic skin ulcers . Contractures paralyze, and autoamputation of fingers or toes may ensue. Facial nerve involvement can lead to paralysis of the eyelids, with keratitis and corneal ulcerations . On microscopic examination , all sites of involvement have granulomatous lesions closely resembling those found in tuberculosis. Because of the strong host defense, bacilli are almost never found, hence the name paucibacillary leprosy . The presence of granulomas and the absence of bacteria reflect strong T-cell immunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Superficial branch of the radial nerve is used for nerve biopsy in neuritic leprosy .

Lyme disease involves multiple organ systems and is divided into three stages: In early localized disease , spirochetes multiply and spread in the dermis at the site of a tick bite , causing an expanding area of redness, often with a pale center. This lesion, called erythema migrans , may be accompanied by fever and lymphadenopathy. In early disseminated disease , spirochetes spread hematogenously throughout the body and cause secondary skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, migratory joint and muscle pain, cardiac arrhythmias, and meningitis often associated with cranial nerve involvement. The third stage, late disseminated disease , manifests many months after the tick bite. B. burgdorferi usually causes chronic arthritis sometimes with severe damage to large joints . Less often, patients will have polyneuropathy and encephalitis that vary from mild to debilitating.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Lyme\u2019s disease is transmitted by Ixodid tick/ Deer tick and results in Bull\u2019s eye lesion</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

In late Lyme disease, there may be extensive erosion of the cartilage in large joints. In Lyme meningitis, the CSF is hypercellular due to a marked lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, and it contains anti-spirochete IgGs.</p>\n<p></p>",

Variable numbers of chlamydial inclusions are seen in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells or inflammatory cells. Regional lymphadenopathy is common, usually occurring within 30 days of infection. Lymph node involvement is characterized by a granulomatous inflammatory reaction associated with irregularly shaped foci of necrosis containing neutrophils ( stellate abscesses ). With time, the inflammatory reaction is dominated by nonspecific chronic inflammatory infiltrates and extensive fibrosis. The latter, in turn, may cause local lymphatic obstruction, lymphedema, and strictures . In active lesions, the diagnosis of lymphogranuloma venereum may be made by demonstration of the organism in biopsy sections or smears of exudate.
