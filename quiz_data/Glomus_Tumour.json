Radiation is used for inoperable tumours, residual tumours, and recurrences after surgery or for older individuals where extensive skull base surgery is not indicated. Embolization is used to reduce the vascularity of the tumour before surgery or is the sole treatment in inoperable patients who have received radiation.</p>\n<p></p>",
