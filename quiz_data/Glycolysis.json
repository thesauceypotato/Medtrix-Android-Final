The reverse process i.e. PEP to pyruvate conversion happens in glycolysis and it is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase. However, it is an irreversible step due to large negative \u0394G. So, pyruvate can't be converted directly into PEP.

Option C: Acetyl CoA Pyruvate formed from glycolysis in cytoplasm enters mitochondria. Pyruvate is also formed by beta-oxidation of fatty acid in the mitochondrial matrix during fasting In mitochondria, pyruvate forms Acetyl CoA by enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reaction aka link reaction. This is an example of oxidative decarboxylation and involves the release of CO 2 along with dehydrogenation/oxidation. Option D: Lactate In exercising muscles, pyruvate gets reduced to lactate due to anaerobic conditions by using the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a reversible reaction\\ When conditions become aerobic again, lactate can be converted back to pyruvate by the same enzyme in the liver as a part of Cori's cycle</p>\n<p></p>",

So, brain cells switch to anaerobic metabolism producing an increasing amount of lactate. So, option B is true.

So, Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity is decreased due to hypoxic conditions. So, Option A is true.

Option D: \u2191CSF lactate is associated with a good prognosis Now if this lactate is getting utilized as an energy source within brain cells through TCA it is associated with good prognosis (means the tissue is recovering from injury), However, if the lactate is not getting utilized in brain cells and it will be exported out back from the cell into CSF. This outcome means severe damage to brain cells so that they are not able to utilize lactate. Hence increased lactate levels in CSF are associated with poor prognosis.

In a routine laboratory test, mild hyperglycemia was detected after the intake of oral glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test. It was found that the lady had hyperglycemia more severe than gestational diabetes and not as severe as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The pregnant lady was diagnosed as suffering from Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY-2). Select the gene responsible for MODY-2?",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Glucokinase gene Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young or MODY is a mild type of hyperglycemia that develops in young women, generally below the age of 25 years. Its prevalence is mostly 1 to 2% in the population. It is important to distinguish MODY-2 from the population who is suffering from type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Mutation in the Glucokinase gene is responsible for the Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young. Mutation in hexokinase gene-1 is responsible for hemolytic anemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option: A. Mutation in the hexokinase I gene is responsible for hemolytic anemia due to a deficiency of hexokinase I. Option: B. The hexokinase 2 gene encodes the hexokinase 2 enzyme which is mainly found in skeletal muscles. Hexokinase 2 enzyme expresses in colon cancer and breast cancer. Its mutation results in insulin resistance in muscles and hyperglycemia.</p>\n<p></p>",
