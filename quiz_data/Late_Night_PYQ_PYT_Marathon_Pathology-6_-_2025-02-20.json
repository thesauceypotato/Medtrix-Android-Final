In this condition, light chain (kappa) is produced in the same quantity as heavy chain (mu), which contrasts with other heavy chain diseases where there is predominant production of heavy chain antibody. The disease presents as an M spike of IgM type and commonly manifests with hyper viscosity syndrome due to the large size of IgM molecules.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Mu chain disease - This is incorrect. Mu (\u03bc) chain disease is a rare heavy chain disease associated with CLL rather than with the presence of kappa light chains in urine. It involves the production of abnormal \u03bc heavy chains without associated light chains.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Mu chain disease</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Sezary disease - This is incorrect. Sezary syndrome is not a heavy chain disease but a variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma characterized by erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, and neoplastic T cells (Sezary cells) with cerebriform nuclei in the blood.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Sezary disease</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Franklin disease - This is incorrect. Franklin disease (gamma heavy chain disease) is characterized by the production of gamma (\u03b3) heavy chains without associated light chains. It presents with fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and is associated with rheumatoid arthritis, but not specifically with kappa light chains in urine.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.
