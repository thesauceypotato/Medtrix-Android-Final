      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. D) Acetylcholine</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 When blood pressure increases, baroreceptors (pressure-sensitive receptors located in the carotid sinus and aortic arch) are activated. These receptors detect the rise in blood pressure and send signals to the cardiovascular center in the medulla oblongata, specifically to the cardio-inhibitory center (CIC). Activation of the CIC results in the stimulation of the vagus nerve, which releases acetylcholine at the SA node of the heart. Acetylcholine acts on muscarinic receptors to decrease the heart rate (a process known as bradycardia), helping to lower the blood pressure back to normal levels.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Norepinephrine : Norepinephrine is typically released in response to a decrease in blood pressure, not an increase. It is a sympathetic neurotransmitter that increases heart rate and contractility, which would raise blood pressure, not lower it.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Norepinephrine</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Epinephrine : Similar to norepinephrine, epinephrine is released by the adrenal medulla in response to stress or low blood pressure. It increases heart rate, myocardial contractility, and peripheral vasoconstriction, which elevates blood pressure. Therefore, it is not released in response to increased blood pressure.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Epinephrine</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Dopamine : Dopamine has various effects depending on the dose but is generally associated with increasing blood pressure and cardiac output. It is not involved in the reflex reduction of heart rate in response to high blood pressure.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Dopamine</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Acetylcholine is released from the vagus nerve at the SA node in response to increased blood pressure, resulting in a decrease in heart rate (bradycardia) as part of the baroreceptor reflex.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

One significant change is the increase in total T3 and T4 levels. This occurs because of the elevated levels of thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), which increases the amount of bound thyroid hormones.

This leads to higher levels of total T3 and total T4. Free T3 and Free T4: Despite the increase in total hormone levels, the free (unbound) hormone levels remain relatively stable. This is why free T3 and free T4 are preferred for thyroid function testing during pregnancy. TSH: The levels of TSH may decrease slightly in the first trimester due to the thyrotropic effects of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), but they generally stabilize in the second and third trimesters. Iodine requirement: Pregnancy increases the body's requirement for iodine by about 50%, due to increased renal clearance and fetal iodine needs.</li><li>\u2022 Thyroid-binding globulin (TBG): The production of TBG increases during pregnancy due to elevated estrogen levels.
