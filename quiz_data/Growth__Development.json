      "text": "A concerned father brings his 8-year-old son, Dev, to the pediatric clinic after noticing his frequent complaints of bone pain and a recent incident where a minor fall resulted in a fracture. During the examination, the pediatrician observes multiple healing fractures of varying ages on the X-rays, along with noticeable bruises on the skin. Initially, there is a suspicion of non-accidental injury, but further assessment reveals Dev has a short stature, distinctive blue sclera, and visible bone deformities in his limbs and spine. These findings suggest a genetic condition affecting bone strength rather than external trauma. What is the pattern of inheritance for Dev's diagnosed condition?",

Initially deemed normal developmental variations, the family sought advice from various sources, including a monk, but saw no improvement in William's condition. An intern at a nearby primary health center noticed something amiss during a routine vaccination visit and referred the family for further evaluation. Upon thorough examination, the pediatrician observes delayed development, frequent unprovoked laughter, and an ataxic gait in William. These findings, along with the specific inheritance pattern, suggest a diagnosis of a paternal imprinting disorder. What is the most likely diagnosis given the child's clinical presentation?",
