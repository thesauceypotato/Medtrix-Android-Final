The virus induces endothelial injury and inflammation, leading to increased vascular permeability and the influx of inflammatory cells, particularly neutrophils. This endothelial dysfunction is a key initiating event in ARDS, resulting in the leakage of protein-rich fluid into the alveolar spaces and subsequent impairment of gas exchange.

The next step should be to measure erythropoietin levels, which helps distinguish between primary and secondary forms of polycythemia. Polycythemia vera (PCV), a primary form of polycythemia, typically shows low erythropoietin levels due to autonomous production of red blood cells driven by JAK2 mutations. In contrast, secondary forms, often seen in high-altitude residents or those with erythropoietin-secreting tumors, present with elevated erythropoietin levels. Evaluating erythropoietin levels helps guide further testing and management, including differentiating between PCV and other causes of absolute polycythemia.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.
