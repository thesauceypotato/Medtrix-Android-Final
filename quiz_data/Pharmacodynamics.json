Chemical It is a type of antagonist that binds to a drug or ligand and renders it ineffective. A chemical antagonist does so by causing certain chemical changes in the ligand it binds.

A competitive antagonist is so-called when, in its presence, there is just no way for the agonist to bind to the active receptor , i.e. the two substances are in competition. That might be because of various mechanisms. The antagonist and the agonist may bind to the same sites, i.e. receptor occupancy may be mutually exclusive. Option:C .

The flat slope of DRC indicates little increase in response will occur over a wide dose range and it is safer</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option:B. Comparison between agonist and study of antagonist is difficult Option:C . Steep slope of DRC indicates that a moderate increase in dose will markedly decrease the response Option:D. Drug with flat slope is dangerous note:b,c, and d are the wrong statement.</p>\n<p></p>",
