This occurs: When the regulation of heat production has been severely disturbed before death, as in sunstroke and some nervous disorders When there has been a great increase in heat production in the muscles due to convulsions, as in tetanus and strychnine poisoning, etc., and When there has been excessive bacterial activity, as in septicaemic conditions cholera and other fevers</p>\n<p></p>",
