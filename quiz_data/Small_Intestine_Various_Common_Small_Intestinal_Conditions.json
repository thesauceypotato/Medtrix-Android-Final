      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pseudomyxoma peritonei This rare condition occurs more frequently in women. The abdomen is filled with yellow jelly, large quantities of which are often encysted. The condition is associated with mucinous cystic tumors of the ovary & appendix. It is often painless and there is frequently no impairment of general health. Pseudomyxoma peritonei does not give rise to extraperitoneal metastases but causes symptoms & complications due to tumor milk. Although an abdomen distended with what seems to be fluid that cannot be made to shift should raise the possibility, the diagnosis is more often suggested by ultrasonography and CT scanning, or made at operation. At laparotomy , masses of jelly are scooped out. The appendix, if present, should be excised together with any ovarian More definitive treatment can be achieved by \u2018complete cyto reduction\u2019 (Sugarbaker technique) in which the right hemicolon, spleen, gall bladder, and greater and lesser omentum are excised, along with stripping of the peritoneum from the pelvis and diaphragm, stripping of the tumor from the surface of the liver (the uterus and ovaries are also removed in women). Intraoperative heated chemotherapy (using mitomycin C) follows and the whole procedure takes about 10 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Pseudomyxoma peritone i Pseudomyxoma peritone i is a condition where mucinous ascites fill the peritoneal cavity due to a ruptured appendiceal or ovarian adenocarcinoma. The most common site of primary cancer leading to pseudomyxoma peritonei is the appendix . The condition usually affects individuals aged 40-50 and occurs with equal frequency in men and women. Patients are often asymptomatic until late in the disease course and may present with abdominal pain and distention, and nonspecific complaints. Physical examination may reveal a new hernia, ascites, distended abdomen with non shifting dullness, and occasionally a palpable abdominal mass. A CT scan can help diagnose and evaluate the extent of the tumor. Preoperative colonoscopy can differentiate a mucinous neoplasm of the appendix from that arising from the colon. The diagnosis is often made during laparotomy, where the peritoneal cavity contains tenacious semisolid mucus and large, loculated cystic masses. Treatment involves cytoreduction , which is the resection of as much of the tumor as possible, followed by intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy (IPHC).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A . Carcinomatosis peritonei is a condition in which cancer cells spread to the peritoneum, the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity, resulting in the formation of multiple tumors throughout the peritoneum. Option: C . Peritoneal inclusion cysts are benign cystic lesions that develop within the peritoneal cavity and are often associated with prior abdominal surgeries or pelvic inflammatory disease. Option: D . Peritoneal loose bodies are small, free-floating nodules of calcified tissue that can be found in the peritoneal cavity, often incidentally discovered during imaging studies.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Operative management may include omentectomy, stripping of involved peritoneum, resection of involved organs, and appendectomy with right hemicolectomy. The survival rate for pseudomyxoma peritonei depends on the type of primary cancer, with adenomucinosis having the best survival rate ( 75% at 5 years ) and peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis having the worst ( 14% at 5 years ).</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Derived from the diverticulum of the mesenteric border of the intestine CHYLOLYMPHATIC CYST: Although all mesenteric cysts are rare, this is the most common variety, probably arising in congenitally misplaced lymphatic tissue that has no efferent communication with the lymphatic system (most frequently in the mesentery of the ileum). The thin wall of the cyst, which is composed of connective tissue lined by flat endothelium, is filled with clear lymph or, less frequently, with chyle, varying in consistency from watered milk to cream. Occasionally, the cyst attains a great size. More often unilocular than multilocular, a Chylolymphatic cyst is almost invariably solitary, although there is an extremely rare variety in which myriads of cysts are found in the various mesenteries of the abdomen. A chylolymphatic cyst has a blood supply that is independent from that of the adjacent intestine and, thus, enucleation is possible without the need of resection of the gut. ENTEROGENOUS CYST: These are believed to be derived either from a diverticulum of the mesenteric border of the intestine that has become sequestrated from the intestinal canal during embryonic life, or from a duplication of the intestine. An enterogenous cyst has a thicker wall than a chylolymphatic cyst and it is lined by a mucous membrane, which is sometimes ciliated. The content is mucinous and either colorless or yellowish brown as a result of past hemorrhage. The muscle in the wall of an enteric duplication cyst and the bowel with which it is in contact have a common blood supply; consequently, removal of the cyst always entails resection of the related portion of the intestine.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mesenteric cysts are typically seen in young adults, usually in the second decade of life, and more commonly in women. Types of mesenteric cysts: Chylolymphatic (MC), Simple (mesothelial), Enterogenous, Urogenital remnant, and Dermoid (teratomatous cyst). Clinical features of mesenteric cysts include painless abdominal swelling, recurrent attacks of abdominal pain, acute abdominal pain due to torsion, rupture, hemorrhage, or infection, and Tillaux triad. CT scan is the diagnostic modality of choice for mesenteric cysts, while ultrasound can also be helpful. Treatment options vary depending on the type of cyst, but enucleation is usually the treatment of choice for Chylolymphatic cysts, while resection and anastomosis are typically necessary for Enterogenous cysts. Aspiration alone is not recommended due to a high recurrence rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Options: A, B & D. are true statements.</p>\n<p></p>",

If a patient presents with clinical symptoms and has been in an endemic area, broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics should be started immediately. Intestinal perforation through an ulcerated Peyer\u2019s patch occurs in approximately 2% of cases.

Children and young adults are most often affected, and improvements in sanitation have decreased its incidence in industrialized countries. The fever is caused by Salmonella typhi , which penetrates the small bowel mucosa and spreads systemically, leading to hyperplasia and ulceration of Peyer patches. Diagnosis is confirmed by isolating the organism from blood, bone marrow, and stool cultures , but other tests are available with varying success rates. Antibiotic therapy is the primary treatment, with prompt administration crucial to reducing the risk of complications and fatalities.

The underlying cause of this syndrome is bacterial overgrowth in stagnant areas of the small bowel produced by stricture, stenosis, fistulas, or diverticula (e.g., jejunoileal or Meckel\u2019s diverticulum). The syndrome can be confirmed by a series of laboratory investigations. Bacterial overgrowth can be diagnosed with cultures obtained through an intestinal tube or by indirect tests such as the 14C-xylose or 14C-cholylglycine breath tests. Excessive bacterial use of 14C substrate leads to an increase in 14C-CO2. After bacterial overgrowth and steatorrhea are confirmed, a Schilling test (57Co-labeled vitamin B12 absorption) may be performed, which should reveal a pattern of urinary excretion of vitamin B12 resembling that of pernicious anemia (a urinary loss of 0% to 6% of vitamin B12 compared with the normal of 7% to 25%). In patients with blind loop syndrome, vitamin B12 excretion is not altered by the addition of intrinsic factor, but a course of a broad-spectrum antibiotic (e.g., tetracycline) should return vitamin B12 absorption to normal. Treatment of patients with blind loop syndrome includes parenteral vitamin B12 therapy and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Tetracyclines have been the mainstay of treatment, but studies have shown that rifaximin and metronidazole demonstrate less resistance and are also effective. For most patients, a single course of therapy (7 to 10 days) is sufficient, and the patient may remain symptom-free for months. Prokinetic agents have been used without real success. Surgical correction of the condition causing stagnation and blind loop syndrome produces a permanent cure and is indicated for patients who require multiple rounds of antibiotics or are receiving continuous therapy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Blind loop syndrome is caused by bacterial overgrowth in stagnant areas of the small bowel due to stricture, stenosis, fistulas, or diverticula.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pneumothorax The image shows a Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. Gastrostomy: The placement of a tube through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach is termed \u2018gastrostomy \u2019. Historically, these were created surgically at the time of laparotomy. Today, the majority are performed by percutaneous insertion under endoscopic control using local anesthesia, known as PEG(percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) tubes. Two methods of PEG are commonly used. The first is called the \u2018direct-stab\u2019 technique in which the endoscope is passed and the stomach is filled with air. The endoscopist then watches a cannula entering the stomach having been inserted directly through the anterior abdominal wall. A guidewire is then passed through the cannula into the stomach. A gastrostomy tube (commercially available) may then be introduced into the stomach through a \u2018peel away\u2019 sheath. The alternative technique is the transoral or push-through technique, whereby a guidewire or suture is brought out of the stomach by the endoscope after transabdominal percutaneous insertion and is either attached to a gastrostomy tube or the tube is pushed over a guidewire. The abdominal end of the wire is then pulled, advancing the gastrostomy tube through the esophagus and into the stomach. Continued pulling abuts it up against the abdominal wall. If patients require enteral nutrition for prolonged periods (4\u20136 weeks), then PEG is preferable to an indwelling nasogastric tube; this minimizes the traumatic complications related to indwelling tubes. PEG does have procedure-specific complications, although these are uncommon.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Gastrostomy tubes are used for longer-term feeding and have physical, psychological, and lifestyle implications. There are three types of gastrostomy insertion : percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ), radiologically inserted gastrostomy ( RIG ), and surgical . PEG is inserted through the abdomen and stomach under endoscopic vision, avoiding surgery and general anesthesia. RIG is an option for patients who cannot have PEG and involves inserting a cannula under radiographic guidance. Surgical gastrostomy may be necessary for patients with distorted intra-abdominal anatomy, usually from previous surgery.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Options: B, C & D. Necrotising fasciitis and intra-abdominal wall abscesses have been recorded. Sepsis around the PEG site is more common and may necessitate systemic antibiotics or repositioning. A persistent gastric fistula can occur on the removal of a PEG if it has been in place for prolonged periods and epithelialization of the tract has occurred. This necessitates surgical closure. Fine-bore tube insertion: The patient should be semi-recumbent. The introducer wire is lubricated and inserted into the fine-bore tube.

There is the displacement of the stomach medially, and a trace of ascitic fluid is present above the liver. Non-parasitic splenic cysts are rare. Splenic cysts are classified as primary cysts (true) or pseudocysts (secondary) on the basis of the presence or absence of lining epithelium. True cysts form from embryonal rests and include dermoid and mesenchymal inclusion cysts. True cysts of the spleen are very rare and are frequently classified as cystic haemangiomas, cystic lymphangiomas, and epidermoid and dermoid cysts . Epidermoid cysts are thought to be of congenital origin and represent 10% of splenic cysts. They are lined by flattened squamous epithelium and are more frequent in children and young patients. Splenectomy or partial splenectomy is usually considered for cysts larger than 5 cm in diameter. These should be differentiated from false or secondary cysts that may result from trauma and contain serous or hemorrhagic fluid. The walls of such degenerative cysts may be calcified and therefore resemble the radiological appearances of a hydatid cyst. The spleen is also a common site for pseudocyst development following a severe attack of pancreatitis.

Technetium-99m pertechnetate scan is the ideal diagnostic test when there is a high suspicion for Meckel diverticulum in children, as is the case in this 18-month-old boy presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding. This scan uses a radioactive tracer that has a high affinity for gastric mucosa and is, therefore, able to identify Meckel diverticulum with high sensitivity and specificity. Ectopic gastric mucosa can secrete gastric acid within the diverticulum, possibly resulting in ileal ulceration and subsequent bleeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Meckel's Diverticulum Meckel's Diverticulum is the most commonly encountered congenital anomaly of the small intestine and occurs in 2% of the population. The \"Rule of Two\" in Meckel's Diverticulum refers to its 2% prevalence, 2-inch length, location 2 feet proximal to the ileocecal valve, and the fact that half of those who are symptomatic are under 2 years of age. Meckel's Diverticulum is a true diverticulum as it has all three layers of the intestine and is located on the antimesenteric border of the ileum 45 to 60 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. Meckel's Diverticulum results from incomplete closure of the omphalomesenteric or vitellointestinal duct and is characterized by the presence of heterotopic tissue, with gastric mucosa being the most common (50%), followed by pancreatic mucosa (5%) and colonic mucosa (rarely). The most common clinical presentation of Meckel's Diverticulum is gastrointestinal bleeding (25-50% ), which is manifested as painless bright red blood from the rectum , with intermittent episodes persisting without treatment. Meckel's Diverticulum can also cause intestinal obstruction (31%), diverticulitis (10-20%), perforation, and peritonitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option:A . Plain abdominal x-rays can be used in the diagnoses of conditions that involve bowel distention or perforation, such as necrotizing enterocolitis or congenital abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract in children (e.g., duodenal atresia). This boy does not present with abdominal distention or tenderness, which would be expected in these conditions. Additionally, he is 18 months old and therefore past the window in which these conditions would manifest. His findings are more consistent with a Meckel diverticulum that would not be seen on a plain abdominal X-ray. Option: C . Rectal suction biopsy is used for the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease. This disease would manifest in neonates and would present with vomiting, constipation, and abdominal distention (none of which is present in this patient). A rectal suction biopsy would not be useful in the diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum, which is usually located in the distal ileum rather than the rectum. Option: D . A water-soluble contrast enema may be performed for the workup of abdominal pain and/or constipation, as it may reveal conditions such as Hirschsprung disease, meconium plug, or distal bowel obstruction/atresia. This patient does not present with abdominal pain or constipation. His symptoms are highly suggestive of a Meckel diverticulum that would not be visible in a water-soluble contrast enema study.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Scintigraphy with sodium 99mTc-pertechnetate is the most accurate diagnostic test in children, while barium studies should be performed in adults with normal nuclear medicine findings.

An abdominal X-ray may show the double bubble sign, although X-ray is used primarily to exclude bowel perforation. Abdominal ultrasound, although not routinely performed, may show a whirlpool sign, for instance. But the target sign which is seen in this patient's ultrasound examination would not be caused by a volvulus. Option: C . Appendectomy is the treatment of choice in acute appendicitis, which is an uncommon event in the first year of life but is possible. The presentation includes fever, vomiting, irritability, diarrhea, tenderness, and guarding of the abdomen. Ultrasound in appendicitis typically shows a dilated appendix with edematous walls. Unfortunately, especially in axial views, appendicitis can mimic the \u201ctarget sign\u201d appearance of intussusception, especially if the appendix is already perforated. On longitudinal views, it should usually be possible to differentiate intussusception and appendicitis though, as the appendix is a blind-ending sac. Additionally, in axial views, the appendiceal lumen is usually filled with hypoechogenic fluid or debris, whereas in intussusception you have the typical alternating echogenicity caused by the intussuscepted bowel mucosa. Option: D. Technetium-99m pertechnetate scan is used to diagnose symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum, which can cause complications such as ulceration, hemorrhage, intussusception, and intestinal obstruction in children. The majority of patients are asymptomatic, but if symptoms are present, hematochezia is the most common. The intussusception diagnosed in this child, especially in light of the reddish bowel movements, could indeed be the result of a Meckel's diverticulum. Regardless of the etiology of the intussusception though, treatment needs to be initiated quickly and should not be delayed by further diagnostic studies such as a technetium scan.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Recurrence after successful hydrostatic reduction is 5-10% , and after operative reduction is 1-4% Recurrence is usually managed by hydrostatic reduction The third recurrence is an indication for operative intervention to look for a lead point</p>\n<p></p>",

Meckel diverticulum is the most common pathologic lead point causing intussusception. A pathological lead point should always be suspected in children older than 5 years of age who present with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, especially if symptoms occur within 6 months of the last episode . Meckel diverticulum can cause bleeding if it contains ectopic gastric mucosal cells that secrete gastric acid a nd can so irritate the adjacent small bowel to the point of ulceration, which explains this child's anemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Meckel's Diverticulum Meckel's Diverticulum is the most commonly encountered congenital anomaly of the small intestine and occurs in 2% of the population. The \"Rule of Two\" in Meckel's Diverticulum refers to its 2% prevalence, 2-inch length, location 2 feet proximal to the ileocecal valve, and the fact that half of those who are symptomatic are under 2 years of age. Meckel's Diverticulum is a true diverticulum as it has all three layers of the intestine and is located on the antimesenteric border of the ileum 45 to 60 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. Meckel's Diverticulum results from incomplete closure of the omphalomesenteric or vitellointestinal duct and is characterized by the presence of heterotopic tissue, with gastric mucosa being the most common (50%), followed by pancreatic mucosa (5%) and colonic mucosa (rarely). The most common clinical presentation of Meckel's Diverticulum is gastrointestinal bleeding (25-50% ), which is manifested as painless bright red blood from the rectum , with intermittent episodes persisting without treatment. Meckel's Diverticulum can also cause intestinal obstruction (31%), diverticulitis (10-20%), perforation, and peritonitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B . Malrotation with volvulus typically presents with acute onset of abdominal pain and bloody stools.

Although the clinical features may be similar to those of this patient's condition, volvulus caused by malrotation of the intestines usually occurs during early infancy and would be uncommon in a 6-year-old child. Option: C . Intestinal polyps are the second most common pathological lead point resulting in intussusception. While intestinal polyps cannot be entirely excluded, they are not the most common cause of intussusception in this age group. This patient appears to have had chronic blood loss that resulted in anemia, suggesting a different etiology. Option: D . Intestinal adhesions may cause bowel obstruction or act as a pathologic lead point for intussusception.

His history of Crohn\u2019s disease also puts him at risk of developing adhesions and fistulas after surgery. Therefore, any surgical procedures to treat his small bowel obstruction should be kept as restrictive as possible. The best option is a bowel-sparing technique like strictureplasty.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Strictureplasty is a local widening procedure used to treat areas of Crohn's disease (CD ) that are narrowed due to fibrostenotic disease. It helps to avoid small bowel resection and is an important bowel-sparing technique. Strictureplasty is particularly useful when there is little or no active inflammation in the involved segment. It is contraindicated in the presence of phlegmon , Crohn's associated cancer, or hemorrhage due to mucosal ulceration. Frozen biopsy carried out intraoperatively may allow a strictureplasty to take place rather than resection if there is any concern about malignancy at the site of a stricture. The Heineke-Mikulicz technique of an antimesenteric longitudinal incision that is closed transversely is the most common technique used for strictureplasty. A Finney antimesenteric side-to-side anastomosis is used to treat long segments of stenosis when preservation of bowel length is important. Multiple strictureplasties can be performed, and strictureplasty can be combined with resection. Complete excision of macroscopically diseased mesentery may reduce the incidence of recurrence following resection, as may anastomotic techniques that ensure that an anastomosis is fashioned on the antimesenteric aspect of the bowel ( Kono - S procedure).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A . Ileocolectomy can be used to treat gastrointestinal cancer or extensive Crohn\u2019s disease. For this patient, it would be an overly aggressive treatment because his small bowel obstruction is only caused by two discrete strictures. Ileocolectomy would also put him at risk of developing short bowel syndrome and complications due to Crohn\u2019s disease. Therefore, a bowel-sparing treatment is preferred. Option: C . Small bowel resection and primary anastomosis might be indicated when a circumscribed diseased part of the small intestine needs to be removed because of conditions such as cancer, a bleeding ulcer, or Meckel diverticulum. Because this patient underwent a partial small bowel resection at birth and has a history of Crohn\u2019s disease, a bowel-sparing technique is preferred over resection or primary anastomosis. Option: D . During laparotomy, there are two discrete strictures noted in the mid-ileum that should be treated operatively. If the patient had cancer and laparotomy would show peritoneal carcinomatosis, it would be an option to discontinue surgery and treat conservatively/start palliative care. However, for this patient, surgery would be therapeutic and should be performed.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>It is important to follow patients closely in the postoperative months to ensure that recrudescence of CD is identified at a very early stage and that medical treatment is reinstated.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All of the above. Crohn's disease is mainly treated medically, with all the mentioned drugs used from time to time. Steroids (prednisolone) are the mainstay of treatment and help in remission in 70%\u201380%. 5-ASA compounds are particularly useful in colonic disease. Immunosuppressive agents (azathioprine) are used for their steroid-sparing effect, particularly when the disease is quiescent.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>It is important to prioritize conservatism in treatment, but patients should not be undertreated if treatment is necessary. Surgery is typically recommended for pain caused by an abscess that is not draining properly. Fissures caused by Crohn's disease often respond well to conservative measures like sitz baths, stool softeners, and oral analgesics. Sphincterotomy and fissurectomy should be avoided in perianal Crohn's disease. Infliximab has been successful in treating fistulizing perianal Crohn's disease, with closure rates ranging from 25% to 67%. A staged approach to perianal disease is usually the most effective strategy, starting with controlling local sepsis. Abscesses should be drained, and fistula tracts need chronic drainage with non-cutting setons. After controlling the perianal sepsis, infliximab treatment can begin. Setons can be removed after two to three infusions to allow for fistula closure. If the fistulas do not close and the local sepsis has resolved, definitive surgical therapy may be necessary.</p>\n<p></p>",

Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) is useful for assessing complex perianal disease and small bowel disorders. MRI enterography, which uses oral contrast or enteroclysis, can effectively reveal small bowel strictures, including the Kantor string sign , without exposing young patients to excessive radiation. Labeled white cell scans can be useful in determining active bowel inflammation and guiding medical treatment in some cases.

Strangulation in Intestinal obstruction Intestinal obstruction consequences are not immediately life-threatening unless there is superimposed strangulation. Strangulation compromises blood supply and leads to bowel ischemia. Ischemia can result from direct pressure on the bowel wall from a constricting band such as a hernial orifice. Distension of the obstructed bowel segment results in high pressure within the bowel wall and can lead to impaired local perfusion and hemorrhagic infarction. The morbidity and mortality associated with strangulation depend on the duration and extent of the ischemia, with elderly patients and those with comorbidities being more vulnerable to its effects.

When strangulation occurs, the viability of the bowel is threatened secondary to the compromised blood supply. The venous return is compromised before the arterial supply. Option: C.

This is caused by the ingestion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by patients with high resistance to the organism.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Causes and Risk Factors: tuberculosis is responsible for all cases of GI tuberculosis. bovis has largely been eliminated by public health measures. Intestinal tuberculosis is more common in poor socioeconomic status. Ingestion of contaminated food may cause primary tuberculosis. Tuberculous bacilli can be ingested through swallowed sputum. Primary intestinal tuberculosis can lead to secondary intestinal tuberculosis. The earliest intestinal lesions are found in the submucosa, while the overlying mucosa is normal. The most common site of involvement is the terminal ileum and ileocecal junction. Other affected regions, in decreasing frequency, include the colon, jejunum, rectum, anal canal, duodenum, stomach, and esophagus. The site of predilection is dictated by the abundance of lymphoid tissue, rate of absorption of intestinal contents, prolonged stasis, and digestive activity of intestinal contents. Clinical Features: Initial symptoms are vague and non-specific. As the disease progresses, individuals may develop fever, night sweats, malaise, weakness, anorexia, and weight loss. The most common symptom of GI tuberculosis is abdominal pain. Diarrhea is another common symptom. Abdominal distention suggests the presence of ascites or subacute intestinal obstruction. Diagnosis: The most common laboratory abnormality is a raised ESR. Ascitic fluid may show lymphocytosis, high protein content, SAAG <1.1, and raised adenosine deaminase. Radiological imaging, such as ultrasound and CT scans, can help diagnose GI tuberculosis. Barium studies can also help diagnose GI tuberculosis, with characteristic features such as the Fleishner or umbrella sign, string sign, Sterlein sign, and napkin ring stenosis. Treatment: The treatment of GI tuberculosis is ATT (anti-tuberculosis treatment) . Fever, malaise, and weight loss can subside in a few weeks. The majority of patients with symptoms of subacute intestinal obstruction and evidence of intestinal strictures show complete resolution of the radiological abnormality. Surgery may be necessary for intestinal obstruction secondary to stricture, free perforation, severe GI hemorrhage, intra-abdominal abscess, internal or external fistula.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Options: A, C & D.

Meckel diverticulum is a true diverticulum that may contain ectopic gastric mucosa and/or pancreatic tissue. Acid secretion by gastric mucosa within the diverticulum results in ileal ulceration and subsequent bleeding. Consequently, chronic blood loss can lead to iron deficiency anemia, and thus a low MCV, as seen in this patient.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Meckel's Diverticulum Meckel's Diverticulum is the most commonly encountered congenital anomaly of the small intestine and occurs in 2% of the population. The \"Rule of Two\" in Meckel's Diverticulum refers to its 2% prevalence, 2-inch length, location 2 feet proximal to the ileocecal valve, and the fact that half of those who are symptomatic are under 2 years of age. Meckel's Diverticulum is a true diverticulum as it has all three layers of the intestine and is located on the antimesenteric border of the ileum 45 to 60 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. Meckel's Diverticulum results from incomplete closure of the omphalomesenteric or vitellointestinal duct and is characterized by the presence of heterotopic tissue, with gastric mucosa being the most common (50%), followed by pancreatic mucosa (5%) and colonic mucosa (rarely). The most common clinical presentation of Meckel's Diverticulum is gastrointestinal bleeding (25-50% ), which is manifested as painless bright red blood from the rectum , with intermittent episodes persisting without treatment. Meckel's Diverticulum can also cause intestinal obstruction (31%), diverticulitis (10-20%), perforation, and peritonitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Plain abdominal x-ray showing a double bubble sign is suggestive of duodenal atresia. This girl does not present with bilious vomiting or abdominal distention, which would be expected in this condition. Additionally, she is 15 months old and therefore past the window in which duodenal atresia would manifest (24\u201348 hours after birth). Option: B . Cobblestone mucosa (due to linear ulcerations of the mucosa) is a classical colonoscopic finding of Crohn\u2019s disease (CD). Although intestinal blood loss in CD can cause iron deficiency anemia and a low MCV, as seen in this patient, this condition is associated with further symptoms such as nonbloody chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and failure to thrive. Moreover, since the peak incidence of CD is 15\u201335 years, it is unlikely in this 15-month-old patient. Option: C. A colonic biopsy showing neutrophil-infiltrated crypts can be seen in ulcerative colitis (UC). This disease can manifest with lower gastrointestinal bleeding and subsequent microcytic anemia, as seen in this patient. However, UC is also associated with abdominal pain, tenesmus, failure to thrive, and extraintestinal manifestations (e.g., uveitis, arthritis, erythema nodosum). Furthermore, the peak incidence of UC is 15\u201335 years; therefore, it is unlikely in this 15-month-old patient.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Scintigraphy with sodium 99mTc-pertechnetate is the most accurate diagnostic test in children, while barium studies should be performed in adults with normal nuclear medicine findings.
