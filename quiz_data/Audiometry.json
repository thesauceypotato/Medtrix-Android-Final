Therefore, high-frequency audiometry effectively monitors losses suspected to have been caused by these factors . It also effectively detects auditory sensitivity changes that occur with ageing.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Conventional audiometry tests frequencies between 0.25 kHz - 8 kHz, whereas high-frequency audiometry tests in the 8 kHz-20 kHz. Ototoxic drugs like aminoglycosides typically affect higher-frequency hearing first and progress to lower frequencies. Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) are more sensitive to detecting auditory dysfunction than high-frequency pure-tone audiometry. OAEs also have the advantage of being practical at the bedside and do not require a soundproof room. Distortion product OAEs are more sensitive than transient evoked OAEs for detecting early signs of ototoxicity.</p>\n<p></p>",
