So the correct answer is C.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect Options: The resting length for skeletal muscle is at the peak of the force tension curve, so changing skeletal muscle length above or below resting length results in moving down the curve. A less forceful contraction is produced that is less effective to support a heavier load. So options B and C are false.</p>\n<p></p>",

The endolymph , because of its inertia, is displaced in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The fluid pushes on the cupula , deforming it. This bends the processes of the hair cells. When a constant speed of rotation is reached, the fluid spins at the same rate as the body, and the cupula swings back into the upright position. When rotation is stopped, deceleration produces a displacement of the endolymph in the direction of the rotation, and the cupula is deformed in a direction opposite to that during acceleration. Rotation causes maximal stimulation of the semicircular canals most nearly in the plane of rotation. Because the canals on one side of the head are a mirror image of those on the other side, the endolymph is displaced toward the ampulla on one side and away from it on the other. The pattern of stimulation reaching the brain, therefore, varies with the direction as well as the plane of rotation. Linear acceleration probably fails to displace the cupula and therefore does not stimulate the cristae.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Rest all options are incorrect because Rotation causes maximal stimulation of the semicircular canals most nearly in the plane of rotation.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The utricular and saccular macula respond to horizontal and vertical acceleration, respectively. The otoliths in the surrounding membrane are denser than the endolymph, and acceleration in any direction causes them to be displaced in the opposite direction, distorting the hair cell processes and generating activity in the vestibular The maculae also discharge in the absence of head movement due to the pull of gravity on the otoliths. The impulses generated from these receptors are partly responsible for labyrinthine righting reflexes. The reflex is initiated by tilting the head which stimulates the otolithic organs; the response is a compensatory contraction of the neck muscles to keep the head level. A vestibulo -ocular reflex stabilizes images on the retina during head movements. Vestibular stimulation during the rotation leads to the inhibition of extraocular muscles on one side and activation of the extraocular muscles on the other side. Although most of the responses to stimulation of the maculae are reflex in nature, vestibular impulses also reach the cerebral cortex. These impulses may mediate conscious perception of motion and supply part of the information necessary for orientation in space. Vertigo is the sensation of rotation in the absence of actual rotation .</p>\n<p></p>",

The corticospinal tract contains axons that cross to the contralateral side of the brain within the pyramids and end within the motor areas of the spinal cord. These structures are essential for the generation of fine voluntary movements. Kinesthesia, the sense of movement and position of the limbs, is handled primarily by the IA and IB afferents that innervate the muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, respectively, and by the parietal lobe.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The primary motor cortex is in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe, extending into the central sulcus. Using stimulation experiments in patients undergoing craniotomy under local anesthesia, this region was mapped to show where various parts of the body are represented in the precentral gyrus showing the motor homunculus with the feet at the top of the gyrus and the face at the bottom. Representation of each body part is proportional in size to the skill with which the part is used in fine, voluntary movement. The areas involved in speech and hand movements are especially large in the cortex; the use of the pharynx, lips, and tongue to form words and of the fingers and opposable thumbs to manipulate the environment are activities in which humans are especially skilled. The supplementary motor area is on and above the superior bank of the cingulate sulcus on the medial side of the hemisphere. It projects to M1 and contains a map of the body, but it is less precise than in M1. The supplementary motor area is involved in organizing or planning motor sequences, while M1 executes the movements. When human subjects count to themselves without speaking, the motor cortex is quiescent, but when they speak the numbers aloud as they count, blood flow increases in M1 and the supplementary motor area. Thus, both regions are involved in voluntary movement when the movements being performed are complex and involve planning mbps to manipulate the environment are activities in which humans are especially skilled.</p>\n<p></p>",

Damage to these neurons is associated with flaccid paralysis, muscular atrophy, fasciculations (visible muscle twitches that appear as flickers under the skin), hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), and hyporeflexia or areflexia \u201cAmyotrophic\u201d means \u201cno muscle nourishment\u201d and describes the atrophy that muscles undergo because of disuse. \u201cSclerosis\u201d refers to the hardness felt when a pathologist examines the spinal cord on autopsy; the hardness is due to the proliferation of astrocytes and scarring of the lateral columns of the spinal cord. ALS is a selective, progressive degeneration of \u03b1-motor neurons. This fatal disease is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease because Gehrig, a famous American baseball player, died of it. Mutation in the gene for Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) on chromosome 21 is found in familial cases of ALS. SOD is a free radical scavenger that reduces oxidative stress. A defective SOD-1 gene permits free radicals to accumulate and kill neurons. An increase in the excitability of deep cerebellar nuclei due to the inhibition of small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels may contribute to the development of cerebellar ataxia.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Riluzole is a drug that opens the SK channels and may be effective in preventing nerve damage caused by excessive release of the excitatory amino acid, glutamate. It is shown to moderately slow the progression of ALS. Spasticity associated with motor neuron disease can be reduced by the muscle relaxant baclofen (a derivative of GABA); in some cases, a subarachnoid infusion of baclofen is given via an implanted lumbar pump. Spasticity can also be treated with tizanidine, a centrally acting \u03b12 -adrenoceptor agonist; its effectiveness is due to increasing presynaptic inhibition of spinal motor neurons. Botulinum toxin is also approved for the treatment of spasticity; this toxin acts by binding to receptors on the cholinergic nerve terminals to decrease the release of acetylcholine, causing neuromuscular blockade.</p>\n<p></p>",

Thus, in humans, \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptors could play an important role in regulating nonshivering thermogenesis .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Brown fat cells also contain many mitochondria. In these mitochondria, an inward proton conductance that generates ATP takes place as usual, but in addition, there is a second proton conductance that does not generate ATP. This \u201cshort circuit\u201d conductance depends on a 32-kDa uncoupling protein (UCP1). It causes the uncoupling of metabolism and generation of ATP so that more heat is produced. An increase in either sympathetic stimulation or circulating norepinephrine and epinephrine in the blood can rapidly increase the rate of cellular metabolism. This effect is called chemical thermogenesis or nonshivering thermogenesis. It results at least partially from the ability of norepinephrine and epinephrine to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, which means that excess foodstuffs are oxidized, and thereby, release energy in the form of heat but does not cause adenosine triphosphate to be formed. The degree of chemical thermogenesis that occurs in an animal is almost directly proportional to the amount of brown fat in the animal\u2019s tissues. This type of fat contains large numbers of special mitochondria where uncoupled oxidation occurs. Brown fat is richly supplied with sympathetic nerves that release norepinephrine, which stimulates tissue expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein (also called thermogenin) and increases thermogenesis.</p>\n<p></p>",
