Act of a person incapable of judgment because of intoxication caused against his will.-Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, because of intoxication, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law; provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Sec 86 IPC. An offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.-In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with specific knowledge or purpose, a person who does the show in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will. Option: C. Sec 87IPC Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by consent.-Nothing which is not intended to cause death or unfortunate injury, and which is not known by the doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence because of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to provoke, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or because of any injury which it may be known by the doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm. Option: D. Sec 88 IPC. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for a person's benefit.-Nothing, which is not intended to cause death, is an offence because of any harm which it may cause or be planned by the doer to drive or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take the risk of that harm.
