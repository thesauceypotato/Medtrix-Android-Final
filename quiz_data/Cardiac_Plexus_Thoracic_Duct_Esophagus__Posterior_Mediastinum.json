Esophageal atresia</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B. Esophageal achalasia Achalasia occurs when nerves in the esophagus become damaged . As a result, the esophagus becomes paralyzed and dilated over time and eventually loses the ability to squeeze food down into the stomach.

Tracheoesophageal fistula Though similar to esophageal atresia, a tracheoesophageal fistula is an atypical connection between the trachea and the esophagus. Option D. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) occurs when there is a hole in the diaphragm, which is the thin sheet of muscle separating the chest from the abdomen. When this gap forms during a fetus's development in the womb, the bowel, stomach, or even the liver can move into the chest cavity.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Any attempt at feeding Esophageal atresia-affected babies could cause aspiration pneumonia as the milk collects in the blind pouch and overflows into the trachea and lungs.
