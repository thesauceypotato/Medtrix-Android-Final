Hormone sensitive lipase is a catabolic enzyme present in adipose tissue cells which causes release of fatty acids from stored TG during starvation. So, it is activated by catabolic enzyme Glucagon. Lipoprotein lipase on the other hand is an anabolic enzyme and release FA from TG of VLDL and chylomicrons in fed state. Understanding the regulatory role of insulin in lipase enzymes is essential for medical students. Insulin inhibits hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) to promote fat storage and activates lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to facilitate fatty acid uptake, which helps maintain energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism in the body.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref- Harper 31 st e/p 240, 245</li><li>\u27a4 Ref- Harper 31 st e/p 240, 245</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

A)\u00a0Galactosemia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Galactosemia is a rare genetic disorder where the body cannot properly metabolize galactose, a sugar present in breast milk and many other foods. Infants with galactosemia are unable to break down galactose and its accumulation can lead to severe complications. Therefore, breastfeeding is an absolute contraindication for infants with galactosemia, and they require a special galactose-free formula.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. HIV: This option is incorrect. While HIV can be transmitted through breast milk, the transmission risk can be significantly reduced by antiretroviral therapy (ART) and other precautions. In certain situations, such as in resource-limited settings where safe alternatives to breastfeeding are not available, the benefits of breastfeeding may outweigh the risks of HIV transmission. However, in areas where safe and affordable alternatives are accessible, avoiding breastfeeding is generally recommended for infants born to HIV-positive mothers.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.</li><li>\u2022 HIV:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Hepatitis B: This option is incorrect. Breastfeeding is not an absolute contraindication for infants born to mothers with hepatitis B. Transmission of hepatitis B through breast milk is considered low, and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that infants receive the hepatitis B vaccine and a dose of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth to prevent transmission. Breastfeeding can generally continue in these cases.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.</li><li>\u2022 Hepatitis B:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Cytomegalovirus infection: This option is incorrect. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can be transmitted through breast milk, but the transmission risk can be reduced. In most cases, breastfeeding is not an absolute contraindication for infants with CMV infection. Precautions such as pasteurization of breast milk or using frozen breast milk from before the infection occurred can be taken to reduce the risk of transmission.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.</li><li>\u2022 Cytomegalovirus infection:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The question aims to identify conditions where breastfeeding is absolutely contraindicated. Understanding absolute contraindications for breastfeeding is crucial for ensuring the safety and health of both the neonate and the mother.

In a healthy individual, the majority of erythropoietin (approximately 90%) is produced by the kidney, specifically by peritubular interstitial fibroblasts. These cells respond to hypoxia (low oxygen levels) by increasing the production of erythropoietin, which then stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. The liver also contributes to erythropoietin production, particularly through sinusoidal cells, although it accounts for only about 10% of the hormone's production under normal conditions.</li><li>\u2022 In certain pathological conditions, such as in some types of anemia (e.g., thalassemia major), the spleen may take on a role in erythropoietin production to compensate for the body's increased need for red blood cells.
