Differences between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s disease (CD): UC affects the colon ; CD can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract , particularly the small and large bowel. UC is a mucosal disease , whereas CD affects the total thickness of the bowel wall . UC produces confluent disease in the colon and rectum , whereas skip lesions characterize CD . CD more commonly causes structuring and fistulation . Granulomas may be found on histology in CD but not in UC. The CD is often associated with perianal disease , which is unusual in UC. CD affecting the terminal ileum may produce symptoms mimicking appendicitis , but this does not occur in UC. Resection of the colon and rectum cures the patient with UC , whereas recurrence is common after resection in CD .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Crohn's disease Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal tract disease, but the cause is unknown. It can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the anus, but it most commonly affects the small intestine and colon. In 55% of cases, the large and small intestines are involved. In 30% of cases, only the small intestine is involved, and in 15% of cases, only the large intestine is involved. Ulcerative colitis Ulcerative colitis is more common in developed countries. It more commonly affects patients under 30 and is more common in females taking oral contraceptive pills. It is more common in whites, Jews, and persons of northern European ancestry. The exact cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown, but infectious agents such as difficile and Campylobacter jejuni have been implicated as possible causes.</p>\n<p></p>",

The term IBS was coined in 1979 to replace outdated terms such as \" irritable \" or \" spastic \" colon. Diagnostic criteria have been updated and are now defined by the Rome IV Foundation. To meet the criteria for IBS, a patient must experience recurrent abdominal pain for at least one day a week for the past three months, along with two or more of the following: the pain is related to defecation, there is a change in stool frequency, or there is a change in stool form. The patient must have experienced symptoms for at least six months before diagnosis.

Colonic investigations are typically performed to rule out organic disease (colonoscopy, barium enema, or CT virtual colonoscopy) but are, by definition, normal. Treatment of IBS is difficult . Many patients benefit from reassurance and symptomatic treatment; dietary modifications, including fiber for constipation, avoidance of fermentable carbohydrates, and reduction of caffeine and nicotine intake, may be of value. Antidiarrheals and antispasmodic agents are commonly prescribed, but the evidence of benefit is poor.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All of the above Treatment of sigmoid volvulus: Flexible sigmoidoscopy or rigid sigmoidoscopy and insertion of a flatus tube should be carried out to allow deflation of the gut. The tube should be secured with tape for 24 hours, and a repeat x-ray is taken to ensure that decompression has occurred. Success, as long as the ischaemic bowel is excluded, will resolve the acute problem. In young patients, an elective sigmoid colectomy is required. It is reasonable not to offer any further treatment following successful endoscopic decompression in the elderly as there is a high death rate (~80% at two years) from causes other than recurrent volvulus. In elderly patients with co-morbidities and recurrent episodes of volvulus, the options are resection or two-point fixation with combined endoscopic/percutaneous tube insertion (gastrostomy tubes are frequently used for this purpose). Failure results in an early laparotomy, with untwisting of the loop and per annum decompression. When the bowel is viable, fixation of the sigmoid colon to the posterior abdominal wall may be safer in inexperienced hands. Resection is preferable if it can be achieved safely. A Paul\u2013Mikulicz procedure is useful, particularly if there is suspicion of impending gangrene; an alternative procedure is a sigmoid colectomy. When the anastomosis is considered unwise, a Hartmann\u2019s procedure with subsequent anastomosis can be carried out.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Sigmoid volvulus Volvulus can occur in any segment of large bowel attached to a long and floppy mesentery or fixed to the retroperitoneum by a narrow base of origin. The sigmoid colon is the most common site of volvulus. Volvulus can be both clockwise or anticlockwise but is more commonly anticlockwise. Age, chronic constipation, institutionalization, neurological impairment, and a high-fiber diet are associated predisposing factors . Sigmoid volvulus presents as acute or subacute intestinal obstruction with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation. Radiological characteristics include a markedly dilated sigmoid colon with the appearance of a bent inner tube or coffee bean appearance, and contrast enema demonstrates the point of obstruction with the pathognomic \"birds beak\" or \"bird of prey\" or \"ace of spades\" sign.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Initial management includes resuscitation followed by endoscopic decompression and detorsion, which can be achieved by placing a rectal tube through a proctoscope or using a colonoscopy. If detorsion/decompression cannot be achieved, laparotomy with sigmoid colon resection is done. Even if detorsion of the sigmoid volvulus is successful, the risk of recurrence is high. Sigmoid colectomy is indicated after the patient has stabilized. Any evidence of bowel gangrene or perforation contraindicates non-operative decompression, and an immediate surgical exploration, such as the Paul - Mikulicz operation, is done.</p>\n<p></p>",

Angiodysplasia is associated with advanced age (> 60 years ) and ESRD , as seen in this patient. In individuals with ESRD, \u223c 30 % of cases of lower GI bleeding are due to angiodysplasia. Other conditions associated with angiodysplasia include von Willebrand disease and aortic stenosis. To confirm the diagnosis in this patient, angiography should be performed. Angiodysplasia - prominent mucosal vessels in a right-sided colonic biopsy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Angiodysplasia (vascular ectasia) Vascular ectasia is the most common vascular lesion found in the colon. It is also the most common cause of recurrent lower intestinal bleeding after age 60. Vascular ectasia arises from age-related degeneration of previously normal colonic blood vessels and is an acquired condition. These lesions are usually multiple, less than 5 mm in diameter, and almost always occur in the cecum or the proximal ascending colon . Vascular ectasia is rarely identified with gross inspection or routine pathologic examination. Diagnosis can be made with colonoscopy or angiography . Angiography may reveal slow emptying of veins and dilation of submucosal vessels. Vascular ectasia is not associated with synchronous angiomatous skin lesions, mucous membranes, or other viscera. According to the API, hemorrhoids and anal fissures are the most common cause of lower GI bleeding, but the bleeding is rarely massive.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option:. A . Colon cancer may present with hematochezia and anemia due to chronic lower GI bleeding, as seen in this patient. However, this patient lacks other typical symptoms of colon cancer, such as weight loss, fever, night sweats, and changes in bowel habits. Moreover, although colon cancer should be investigated for and suspected in all elderly male patients with rectal bleeding, it is not the most common epidemiological cause of rectal bleeding in this demographic group. Therefore, the likelihood of cancer being the cause of this patient's rectal bleeding is not the highest. Option: B. Esophageal varices are the most common cause of esophageal bleeding. Heavy alcohol consumption, as seen in this patient, increases the risk for alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis, which may eventually lead to the formation of esophageal varices and subsequent variceal bleeding. While variceal bleeding usually manifests with sudden onset of hematemesis and severe hemorrhage, this patient presents with a history of chronic blood loss, recurrent bloody stools, and gradual progression of symptoms over the past six months. Option: C . Tissue ischemia due to decreased splanchnic perfusion is characteristic of ischemic colitis. This patient's ESRD and diabetes mellitus increased his risk for ischemic colitis. While ischemic colitis can lead to GI bleeding, it typically presents with a sudden onset of symptoms as opposed to this patient's gradual progression of clinical findings over the past six months. Moreover, ischemic colitis would present with severe periumbilical pain, diarrhea, and high fever.</p>\n<p></p>",

Focal weakness of the colonic muscular layer, typically at points where the vasa recta traverse the intestinal wall, allows for the formation of protrusions of mucosal and submucosal layers in response to increased intraluminal pressure (e.g., from chronic constipation). These protrusions (i.e., diverticula) are referred to as \u201c pseudodiverticula \u201d because not all layers of the intestinal wall are affected. Diverticulosis is the asymptomatic presence of these protrusions (identified as air-filled pouches on CT). Diverticulitis is an acute inflammation of the diverticula that typically manifests with bowel wall thickening on CT, fever, left-sided lower abdominal pain, and bloody mucoid diarrhea, all seen in this patient.

An infiltrative growth in the descending colon is consistent with left-sided colorectal cancer (CRC) . CRC can manifest with changes in bowel habits (e.g., diarrhea), rectal bleeding, and abdominal pain. However, as opposed to this patient's acute presentation, symptoms usually develop over a long period. Moreover, nonspecific symptoms (e.g., weight loss, night sweats, fatigue) would be expected at that point. Also, a CT scan typically shows a soft tissue density mass causing narrowing of the bowel lumen; adjacent air-filled pouches are not found in this condition. Option: C. Transmural inflammation of the terminal ileum is consistent with Crohn's disease (CD) . CD may manifest with low-grade fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea, as seen in this patient. However, he lacks other typical features of CD, such as signs of malabsorption (e.g., weight loss, anemia) and extraintestinal symptoms (e.g., arthritis, erythema nodosum). A CT scan of a patient with CD may show bowel wall thickening, fat stranding, and strictures or fistulas; air-filled pouches are not typically seen in this condition. Option: D. Twisting the sigmoid colon around its mesentery is consistent with sigmoid volvulus , which can lead to bowel obstruction, infarction, and perforation. Sigmoid volvulus typically manifests with episodic abdominal pain, asymmetric abdominal distention, and progressive signs of bowel obstruction. Rectal bleeding, hematemesis, and peritonitis may also be present in severe cases.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Ischemic colitis In ischemic colitis , sudden blood flow compromise results in bowel wall injury, which may progress to necrosis and infection. During abdominal aortic repairs, instrumentation of the aorta can produce emboli that lodge in downstream vessels and cause ischemia, which may be worsened by significant blood loss and vasopressor use. Clinically, ischemic colitis typically presents in three phases : hyperactive phase of crampy abdominal pain with bloody, loose stools ; paralytic phase with diffuse pain, bloating, absent bowel sounds, and cessation of stools ; shock phase with signs of peritonitis and septic shock . These phases can be clearly identified in this patient's clinical course, as her vital signs indicate early signs of developing shock.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A.Abdominal compartment syndrome can result from the accumulation of blood (e.g., following surgery) or fluid in the intra-abdominal space causing elevated intra-abdominal pressure. The condition leads to abdominal distention and multiorgan-system dysfunction secondary to reduced cardiac output due to decreased venous return. Although this patient has hypotension, tachycardia, and abdominal distention, bloody stools are not typically associated with abdominal compartment syndrome. Additionally, oliguria, renal failure, tachypnea, wheezing, and nausea/vomiting would likely be present, making this diagnosis unlikely. Option: B. Postoperative ileus is considered physiologic for hours to days immediately following abdominal surgery. This period may be longer following open surgery and surgery complicated by bleeding, infection, and inflammation. It is considered pathological if it persists for > 3\u20135 days and is accompanied by nausea/vomiting, absence of flatus, abdominal distention, diffuse abdominal pain, and reduction of bowel sounds. A plain abdominal X-ray may show dilated bowel loops with air in the colon and rectum. Despite this patient's complicated postoperative course, the fact that she has had bowel movements suggests that her postoperative ileus has resolved. Option: C. Recent systemic antibiotic use and hospital exposure can put patients at risk for C. difficile infection with the development of pseudomembranous colitis . The most common triggers include clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins, including cefazolin, which was given to the patient preoperatively. Following C. difficile infection, patients develop cramping abdominal pain, fever, and multiple episodes per day of diarrhea, which can progress to fulminant colitis with abdominal distention and hypovolemia. However, diarrhea from pseudomembranous colitis is characteristically foul-smelling, watery, and frequent in contrast to this patient's 2 episodes of bloody stools.</p>\n<p></p>",

Thrombotic occlusion of a mesenteric vein (e.g., in patients with portal hypertension or hereditary thrombophilias) or mesenteric artery (e.g., in patients with atherosclerosis), and decreased blood flow to the mesenteric artery (e.g., in severe hypovolemia) are less common causes of acute mesenteric ischemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Certain medical conditions increase the risk of non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia .

Moreover, in both forms of IBD, patients usually have a history of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, which this patient has not reported. Option: B. Perforation of an inflamed diverticular pouch ( diverticulitis ) can cause peritonitis and septic shock, both of which are seen here. Diverticulitis can also cause acute hematochezia. However, features of bowel infarction, which are seen during this patient's open laparotomy, are not expected; a laparotomy would instead show outpouching of the intestine wall, typically in the sigmoid colon (most common location) intestinal diverticula). Moreover, patients with diverticulitis typically report localized abdominal pain (usually in the left lower quadrant) before the onset of diffuse abdominal pain from peritonitis. Option: D.

Heparin anticoagulation is the definitive management of venous thromboembolism. Venous thrombosis accounts for < 10% of cases of acute mesenteric ischemia and is associated with milder symptoms that develop gradually (over weeks). Heparin anticoagulation primarily prevents clots from forming or expanding rather than breaking them apart, making it an insufficient treatment for arterial thromboembolism. This patient will likely receive heparin anticoagulation to limit the expansion of the thrombus before undergoing more definitive treatment. Option: C. Although colonoscopy is used to diagnose large bowel pathologies (e.g., lower gastrointestinal bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulosis, colon cancer), it is not indicated for patients with acute mesenteric ischemia.

Patients with CMI often develop an aversion to certain foods that trigger pain (food fear) and lose weight.

However, in pancreatic cancer , the pain is typically continuous, radiates to the back, and worsens at night and when lying down. This patient's intermittent, postprandial, non-radiating epigastric pain suggests a diagnosis that does not cause an elevation in CA 19-9. Option: B. Colonoscopy is the preferred diagnostic test when a colonic disease (e.g., colon cancer, diverticulosis, IBD) is suspected. Colonic pathologies typically cause colicky abdominal pain unrelated to food intake and associated with a significant alteration in bowel habits. This patient's upper abdominal pain worsens after meals, and occasional diarrhea is more consistent with an upper gastrointestinal pathology. Option: C. Right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound is the preferred diagnostic test for gallbladder (GB) disease . Symptomatic cholelithiasis can manifest with intermittent postprandial upper abdominal pain (biliary colic) that is not relieved with acid suppression therapy, as seen in this patient.
