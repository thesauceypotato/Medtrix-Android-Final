Intracardiac adrenaline is no better in effectiveness than IV, Intraosseous, or endotracheal. Moreover, it can cause significant myocardial damage. Therefore, present-day CPR does not advocate the use of intracardiac adrenaline. In past, it used to be given in 4th intercostal space at the left sternal border Adrenaline stimulates beta receptors. It increases the stroke volume of the Systolic pressure rises but diastolic pressure falls. Vasoconstriction in vital areas is less as compared to non-vital areas leading to the diversion of blood from non-vital (skin, splanchnic) to vital structures (brain and heart).On lower doses it causes tachycardia but on higher doses, there is reflex bradycardia because of intense vasoconstriction. The concentration of adrenaline in CPR for all three recommended routes {IV, IO, ET} is 1:10,000 except endotracheal concentration for children which is 1:1000.</p>\n<p></p>",

Secondly, sodium bicarbonate increases the solute load, difficult to be handled by an already compromised heart.
