Since the bones of the lateral wall and the roof are usually able to withstand such trauma, the fracture most frequently involves the floor of the orbit along the thin bone covering the infraorbital canal, the sign is called \u2018tear drop\u2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The teardrop sign refers to the appearance of herniated intraorbital fat (+/- inferior rectus muscle) which has protruded through a fracture of the inferior orbital wall.

The posterior portion may drop, resulting in an open bite, and this is a useful diagnostic feature, as the Le Fort I fracture can often be difficult to detect on radiographs. Option: C. Le Fort III or suprazygomatic fracture: there is complete separation of the midface from the cranial base, resulting in clinical lengthening of the face.
