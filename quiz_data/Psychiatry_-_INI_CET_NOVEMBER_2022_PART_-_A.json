Typical antipsychotics exert their antipsychotic effects through D2 receptor antagonism, which reduces positive symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. 5HT2A antagonist: Causes weight loss.: Atypical antipsychotics, which antagonize the 5HT2A receptor, are known to cause weight gain rather than weight loss. This is a common side effect observed with these medications. Option C. 5HT1A: Treats negative symptoms : Antagonism of the 5HT1A receptor has not been found to be a primary mechanism for treating negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Other neurotransmitter systems, such as dopamine and glutamate, are more closely associated with the treatment of negative symptoms. Option D. D2 antagonism: Increases positive symptoms : D2 antagonism is the primary mechanism of action for antipsychotic medications. Antagonizing the D2 receptor helps reduce positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, in schizophrenia. Therefore, D2 antagonism does not increase positive symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Atypical antipsychotics have a lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects compared to typical antipsychotics due to their affinity for multiple receptor types, including 5HT2A antagonism. Weight gain is a common side effect associated with the use of atypical antipsychotics due to their impact on appetite regulation and metabolism</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase Disulfiram is an irreversible inhibitor of both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of aldehyde dehydrogenase, not alcohol dehydrogenase. It works by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for metabolizing acetaldehyde into acetic acid, leading to the accumulation of acetaldehyde in the body when alcohol is consumed. This causes unpleasant symptoms known as the disulfiram-alcohol reaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Disulfiram is used as a behavioral modification therapy for alcohol dependence. It is administered to highly motivated individuals who have abstained from alcohol for at least 12 hours. The disulfiram-alcohol reaction can persist for up to 14 days after the last dose of disulfiram. Alcohol consumption during disulfiram therapy leads to increased concentrations of acetaldehyde, resulting in a range of aversive reactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Does not stop cravings: Disulfiram does not directly stop cravings, but it works through aversive conditioning, leading to a reduction in cravings over time. Option B. Accumulates acetaldehyde: Correct. Disulfiram inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase, resulting in the accumulation of acetaldehyde when alcohol is consumed, causing unpleasant reactions. Option D. Starting dose is 250mg: Disulfiram is typically initiated at a dose of 250 mg/day, with a range of 125-500 mg/day depending on individual patient response and tolerability.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Disulfiram works by creating a negative association between alcohol consumption and the unpleasant symptoms caused by the accumulation of acetaldehyde. It is important to educate patients about the potential consequences of consuming alcohol while on disulfiram therapy to enhance compliance.</p>\n<p></p>",

In PAH, due to limited lung function, the ventilation (Ve) is impaired, resulting in low values of expired CO2 (VCo2). However, this option is not indicative of >10% mortality in 1 year. Enlarged RA > 26 mm : In PAH, the elevated pressure in the pulmonary artery causes increased workload on the right ventricle. As a result, the right atrium (RA) compensates by enlarging in size. An enlarged RA (>26 mm) is associated with poor prognosis and higher mortality rates in PAH patients. Pericardial effusion : Pericardial effusion is the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac around the heart. In PAH, the primary pathology is in the pulmonary artery, and pericardial effusion is not a characteristic feature. Therefore, pericardial effusion is not suggestive of >10% mortality in 1 year for PAH patients. Recurrent syncope attack : In PAH, the compromised blood supply to the left side of the heart can lead to reduced cardiac output and low blood pressure. This can result in syncopal attacks (fainting spells) in patients with PAH. Recurrent syncope attacks indicate a more severe disease course and are associated with increased mortality.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is characterized by elevated pressure in the pulmonary artery, leading to right ventricular dysfunction. Ve/VCo2 slope is a measure used in cardiopulmonary exercise testing, but its association with mortality in PAH patients is not well established.
