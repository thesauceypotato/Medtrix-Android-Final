      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hormone sensitive lipase (hsl) The correct answer is A. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). When insulin levels are low and glucagon levels are high, it indicates a state of low insulin: glucagon ratio. This hormonal imbalance leads to the activation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>HSL is an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of stored triglycerides (fat) into free fatty acids and glycerol, which can be used as an energy source by the body. Activation of HSL promotes lipolysis, the process of breaking down stored fats, and releases fatty acids into the bloodstream for energy utilization by various tissues in the body.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B. Glycogen synthase: A low insulin: glucagon ratio actually inhibits glycogen synthase activity. Insulin is responsible for promoting glycogen synthesis by activating glycogen synthase, while glucagon opposes the action of insulin and promotes glycogen breakdown (glycogenolysis). Option: C. Lipoprotein lipase: Lipopro tein lipase (LPL) is not dilyrect affected by the insulin: glucagon ratio. LPL is an enzyme that plays a role in the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in the bloodstream. Its activity is influenced by various factors, such as the concentration of circulating lipoproteins. Option: D. HMP pathway: The hexose monophosphate (HMP) pathway, also known as the pentose phosphate pathway or the phosphogluconate pathway, is involved in the metabolism of glucose. It operates parallel to glycolysis and produces various intermediates necessary for nucleotide synthesis and antioxidant defense. The insulin: glucagon ratio does not have a direct effect on the HMP pathway.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The Insulin Glucagon Ratio (IGR) is the relationship between levels of circulating insulin and glucagon. A low insulin to glucagon ratio stimulates mobilization of stored energy, increases glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and promotes the breakdown of adipose tissue into free fatty acids and glycerol. It\u2019s a predominantly catabolic scenario. A high insulin to glucagon ratio promotes protein synthesis, lowers glucose levels, and reduces the release of free fatty acids.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA The Role of Insulin and Glucagon:- Process Insulin Glucagon Glycogenesis Increased glycogen synthesis Inhibited glycogen synthesis Gluconeogenesis Inhibited gluconeogenesis and endogenous glucose production Increased gluconeogenesis of amino acids and fatty acids Glycolysis Increased glycolysis and glucose burning Inhibited glycolysis and increased beta- oxidation and fat burning Ketogenesis Inhibited ketone body production and lower fat oxidation Increased ketone production and utilization Lipogenesis Increased fat tissue creation and storage Inhibited fat tissue creation and increased fat storage mobilization Protein synthesis Decreased protein degradation and gluconeogenesis Increased amino acid uptake by the liver; decreased amino acids in plasma</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>More positive In the given scenario, with an increased serum K+ concentration of 5.5 mEq/L, the effect on the resting membrane potential would be that it becomes more positive. Elevated extracellular potassium levels can depolarize cell membranes, making the membrane potential less negative or even positive. This depolarization can have various effects on cell function and can lead to alterations in electrical signaling and excitability. Therefore, the correct answer to question is A. More positive.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Intravascular hemolysis refers to the destruction of red blood cells within blood vessels. When red blood cells break down, they release their intracellular contents, including potassium (K+), into the bloodstream. An increase in serum K+ concentration can have an impact on the resting membrane potential of cells, including excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells. The resting membrane potential is primarily determined by the balance of potassium ions (K+) inside and outside the cell. In a normal healthy individual, the resting membrane potential is around -70 millivolts (mV). An increase in serum potassium concentration can disrupt this balance and affect the resting membrane potential.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B. More negative: This option suggests that the resting membrane potential would become more negative in response to the increased serum potassium. However, in the context of hyperkalemia resulting from intravascular hemolysis, the opposite effect is expected. Elevated extracellular potassium levels tend to depolarize the cell membrane and make the resting membrane potential less negative. Option: C . Remain Unchanged: This option implies that the resting membrane potential would not be affected by the increased serum potassium. However, changes in extracellular potassium concentration can have a significant impact on the resting membrane potential, as potassium is one of the key ions involved in establishing and maintaining the resting membrane potential. Therefore, it is unlikely that the resting membrane potential would remain unchanged in the presence of hyperkalemia. Option: D. Zero: This option suggests that the resting membrane potential would become zero in response to the increased serum potassium. However, this is not accurate. The resting membrane potential is the electrical potential difference across the cell membrane when the cell is at rest. It is typically negative, not zero, due to the differential distribution of ions across the membrane. Hyperkalemia may alter the resting membrane potential, but it would not reduce it to zero.</p>\n<p></p>",

This leads to the accumulation of fluid in the lungs, impaired gas exchange, and respiratory distress. One of the key mechanisms contributing to these changes is an increase in surface tension within the alveoli. Surfactant, a substance produced by type II alveolar cells, plays a crucial role in reducing surface tension. In ARDS, the production and function of surfactant are impaired, leading to increased surface tension. Increased surface tension causes the collapse of alveoli during expiration and reduces lung compliance, making it more difficult for the neonate to breathe effectively. Therefore, option A is the correct statement for ARDS: Surface tension is increased, and lung compliance is decreased.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B. Surface tension increased and lung compliance increased: This statement is incorrect because in ARDS, there is an increase in surface tension within the alveoli. As a result, the alveoli tend to collapse during expiration, making it more difficult for the neonate to breathe. Additionally, ARDS is characterized by decreased lung compliance, meaning that the lungs are less expandable and more stiff, further contributing to respiratory distress. Option: C. Surface tension decreased and lung compliance decreased: This statement is incorrect because in ARDS, the opposite occurs. The surface tension is increased due to the impaired production and function of surfactant, which leads to alveolar collapse during expiration. Additionally, lung compliance is decreased, meaning the lungs are less expandable and more stiff, which further hampers breathing efforts. Option: D. Surface tension decreased and compliance increased: This statement is incorrect because, in ARDS, there is an increase in surface tension within the alveoli.

Primary active transport: Primary active transport is an energy-dependent process in which molecules or ions are actively transported across a cell membrane against their concentration gradient.

In the absence or deficiency of surfactant, surface tension is increased, leading to the collapse of the alveoli during expiration. Decreased compliance refers to the stiffness or decreased ability of the lungs to expand. In RDS, the lack of surfactant results in decreased lung compliance, making it harder for the newborn to breathe effectively.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer: Decrease compliance and increased surface tension.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Increase compliance and decreased surface tension: This option is incorrect because surfactant deficiency leads to a decrease in compliance of the lungs.

Forcefully exhaling the ERV is an active process requiring the contraction of expiratory muscles in the chest and abdomen.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. FRC (Functional Residual Capacity): FRC refers to the amount of air that remains in the lungs after a normal exhalation. It represents the volume of air that is left in the respiratory system at the end of a resting breath. FRC is the combination of the expiratory reserve volume (ERV), which is the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation, and the residual volume (RV), which is the volume of air that remains in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. Option: C. RV (Residual Volume): RV is the volume of air that remains in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. It is the amount of air that cannot be expelled from the lungs, even with the strongest possible exhalation. The RV plays an important role in maintaining lung function and preventing lung collapse. Since it cannot be measured directly with a spirometer, special techniques such as body plethysmography or gas dilution methods are used to estimate the RV. Option: D. FVC (Forced Vital Capacity): FVC represents the maximum amount of air a person can forcefully exhale after taking a deep breath. It is a measure of lung capacity and is often used to assess lung function. FVC is typically measured using a spirometer, which records the volume of air exhaled by the individual during a forced exhalation starting from maximal inhalation. FVC is a useful parameter for diagnosing and monitoring respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and restrictive lung diseases.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Pulmonary Volumes and Capacities Normal Values (ml) Volumes Tidal volume 500 Inspiratory reserve volume 3000 Expiratory volume 1100 Residual volume 1200 Capacities Inspiratory capacity 3500 Functional residual capacity 2300 Vital capacity 4600 Total lung capacity 5800</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

At this stage, the cell is polarized, meaning there is a difference in electrical charge across the cell membrane. As the depolarization progresses, the action potential reaches its peak at point B. Point B represents the peak of depolarization, where the membrane potential reaches its highest positive value. At this stage, the cell is considered to be in the absolute refractory period. The absolute refractory period extends from point B to point C on the action potential curve. During this phase, the cell is completely unresponsive to any new stimuli. This is due to the inactivation of sodium channels that are responsible for depolarization. Following the absolute refractory period, the membrane potential begins to repolarize, moving towards its resting state. This repolarization phase is represented by the downward slope from point C to point D on the action potential curve. The relative refractory period occurs immediately after the absolute refractory period and extends to the end of repolarization at point D.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Rest Options are incorrect, above explained All things considered.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron causes the target cell to depolarize to- ward the threshold potential.

At the same time, Na channels close. The membrane becomes hyperpolarized as K+ ions continue to leave the cell. The hy- perpolarized membrane is in a refractory period and cannot fire. The K+ channels close and the Na+/K+ transporter restores the resting potential.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>RMP becomes less negative The correct answer is B. RMP becomes less negative, as an elevated potassium level reduces the negative charge across the cell membrane, leading to a depolarization of the resting membrane potential. The other options are incorrect based on the effects of increased extracellular potassium levels. The elevated potassium level (5.5 mmol/L) in the presented case can have several effects on peripheral neurons. an elevated potassium level leads to a decrease in the negative charge across the cell membrane, resulting in a depolarization of the RMP.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Potassium ions are important for RMP because of its active transport, which increase more its concentration inside the cell. However, the potassium-selective ion channels are always open, producing an accumulation of negative charge inside the cell. As potassium levels increase further, the resting membrane potential continues to become less negative, and thus progressively decreases Vmax.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. RMP becomes more negative: This option is incorrect. In the context of elevated potassium levels, the resting membrane potential (RMP) of peripheral neurons tends to become less negative or depolarized. This occurs because the increased extracellular potassium concentration reduces the concentration gradient across the cell membrane, making it more difficult for positively charged ions (such as potassium) to move out of the cell. As a result, the RMP tends to shift toward a less negative value. Option: C. RMP becomes positive followed by negative: this option is incorrect. While an elevation in potassium levels can cause a depolarization of the RMP (making it less negative), it does not typically lead to a subsequent positive shift in the RMP followed by a negative shift. Option: D. RMP becomes more positive: This option is incorrect. As mentioned earlier, an elevated potassium level generally leads to a depolarization of the RMP, making it less negative. It does not cause the RMP to become more positive.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The resting membrane potential (RMP) of a nerve fibre depends on the diffusion of both K+ and Na+ and the Na+ - K+ATPase pump. The most predominant factor, however, is the diffusion of K+ ions. This is because, at rest, the permeability of the membrane of the nerve fibre to K+ ions is almost 100 times greater than that to Na+.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Resting membrane potential (RMP) in tissues :- Cell Type Resting Membrane Potential (mV) Excitable?
