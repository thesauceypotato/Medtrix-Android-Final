It is the opacity that persists or develops after extracapsular lens extraction. Causes (i) Residual opaque lens matter may persist after cataract when it is imprisoned between the remains of the anterior and posterior capsule, surrounded by fibrin (following iritis) or blood (following Hyphema ). (ii) Proliferative Proliferative type after cataract may develop from the left out anterior epithelial cells in the capsular bag. The proliferative hyaline bands may sweep across the whole posterior capsule.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Clinical types After-cataract may present as thickened posterior capsule opacification (PCO), or dense membranous after cataract ( or Soemmering\u2019s ring which refers to a thick ring of after cataract formed behind the iris, enclosed between the two layers of capsule or Elschnig\u2019s pearls in which the vacuolated subcapsular epithelial cells are clustered like soap bubbles along the posterior capsule</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Treatment Thin membranous after cataract and thickened posterior capsule are best treated by YAG-laser capsulotomy or discussion with cystectomy or Zeigler\u2019s knife. Dense membranous after cataract needs surgical membranectomy . Soemmering\u2019s ring after cataract with a clean central posterior capsule needs no treatment. Elschnig\u2019s pearls involving the central part of the posterior capsule can be treated by YAG-laser capsulotomy or discussion with cystectomy.</p>\n<p></p>",

Erythropsia and cyanopsia Signs of aphakia The limbal scar may be seen in surgical aphakia. The anterior chamber is deeper Iridodonesis i.e., tremulousness of the iris can be demonstrated.

Spectacles Disadvantages of spectacles. Image is magnified by 30%, so not useful in unilateral aphakia (produces diplopia). The problem of spherical and chromatic aberrations of thick lenses. The field of vision is limited. Prismatic effect of thick glasses. \u2018Roving ring Scotoma\u2019 (Jack in the Box phenomenon). Cosmetic blemishes especially in young aphakic. Contact lenses. Advantages of contact lenses Less magnification of Image. Elimination of aberrations and prismatic effect of thick glasses. Wider and better field of vision. Cosmetically more acceptable. Better suited for uniocular aphakia. Disadvantages of contact lenses are: more cost; cumbersome to wear, especially in old age and childhood; and Corneal complications may be associated. Intraocular lens implantation Primary intraocular lens implantation is done during cataract surgery. Secondary intraocular lens implantation Refractive corneal surgery includes: Keratophakia and Epikeratophakia Hyperopic Lasik may be tried in cases where secondary IOL cannot be implanted</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Pseudophakia Pseudophakia is a Latin word for false lens. We use this term after placing an artificial lens into the eye. Also known as intraocular IOL, lens implants, or \"fake eye lenses,\" this procedure can significantly improve vision after removing cataracts and replacing them with a new lens. Signs: Cloudy or blurred vision Faded colors Trouble seeing at night Sensitivity to glare from sunlight, lamps, or headlights Double vision in one eye Frequent need to change your eyeglass or contact lens prescription A need for brighter light when you read or do other close-up activities Option C.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Topical Antibiotics Topical antibiotics may promote the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, leading to the potential of endophthalmitis caused by more virulent organisms. Endophthalmitis is an inflammatory condition of the intraocular cavities (ie, the aqueous and/or vitreous humor), usually caused by infection. Noninfectious (sterile) endophthalmitis may result from various causes such as retained native lens material after an operation or from toxic agents. Panophthalmitis is inflammation of all coats of the eye, including intraocular structures.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Risk Factors of Endophthalmitis : Doctor -Hand Cleaning, proper draping Patient -Immunocompromised, old age, comorbidities, local infections Environment - Surgery related: Leaky wounds, Heparinization, surgical complications.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B . The two types of endophthalmitis are endogenous (ie, metastatic) and exogenous. Endogenous endophthalmitis results from the hematogenous spread of organisms from a distant source of infection (eg, endocarditis). Exogenous endophthalmitis results from direct inoculation of an organism from the outside as a complication of ocular surgery, foreign bodies, and/or blunt or penetrating ocular trauma. Option: A . Pars plana vitrectomy or vitreous aspiration may be performed by an ophthalmologist with the administration of intravitreal antibiotics (ie, vancomycin, amikacin, ceftazidime). Option: D. Consider systemic antibiotic administration as well as intravitreal steroids. Patients with postoperative endophthalmitis usually are not admitted to the hospital. However, the decision to admit the patient is determined in consultation with the ophthalmologist.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Diagnosis of Endophthalmitis - It is a clinical diagnosis confirmed with positive aqueous or vitreous culture.</p>\n<p></p>",

However, in most cases, it is clinically insignificant, does not produce any visual problem, and undergoes spontaneous regression. In a few cases, a significant CME typically produces visual diminution one to three months after cataract extraction. On fundoscopy, it gives a honeycomb appearance . On fluorescein angiography, it depicts a typical flower petal pattern (see Fig. 12.25A) due to leakage of dye from perifoveal capillaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Etiopathogenesis In most cases, it is associated with vitreous incarceration in the wound and mild iritis. The role of some prostaglandins is being widely considered in their etiopathogenesis.
