Alterations in PTH production by the parathyroid cell can be caused by changes in the response to extracellular fluid calcium (Ca) that are detected by the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). Furthermore, PTH (or PTH-related peptide [PTHrP]) can show altered efficacy in target cells such as in proximal tubular cells, by altered function of its receptor (PTH/PTHrP receptor) or the signal transduction proteins, G proteins such as G,a that is linked to adenylate cyclase (AC), the enzyme responsible for producing cyclic AMP (CAMP) (also illustrated are Gaq/Ga11, which activate an alternate pathway of receptor signal transmission involving the generation of inositol triphosphate [IP] or diacylglycerol [DAG]). Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the CaSR cause familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FBHH) and homozygous mutations (both alleles mutated) and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT); heterozygous gain-of-function causes autosomal dominant hypercalciuric hypocalcemia (ADHH). Other defects in parathyroid cell function that occur at the level of gene regulation (oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes) or transcription factors are discussed in the text. Blomstrand's lethal chondrodysplasia is due to homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the PTH/PTHrP receptor, a neonatally lethal disorder, while pseudohypoparathyroidism involves inactivation at the level of the G proteins, specifically mutations that eliminate or reduce Ga activity in the kidney (see text for details). Acrodysostosis can occur with (mutant regulatory subunit of PKA) or without hormonal resistance (mutant PDE4D or PDE3A). Jansen's metaphyseal chondrodysplasia and McCune-Albright syndrome represent gain-of-function mutations in the PTH/PTHrP receptor and G,a protein, respectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: C .
