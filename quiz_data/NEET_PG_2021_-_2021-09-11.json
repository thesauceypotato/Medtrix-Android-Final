A) Stop warfarin and start LMWH.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Stop warfarin and start LMWH: Warfarin is teratogenic and has a significant risk of causing warfarin embryopathy, particularly in doses greater than 5mg per day. In pregnancy, it is recommended to change warfarin to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the first trimester, especially if the warfarin dose exceeds 5 mg/day. After 13 weeks, it can be switched back to warfarin until delivery. Near delivery, warfarin should again be replaced by LMWH or UFH to manage the risk of bleeding complications during delivery.</li><li>\u2022 Stop warfarin and start LMWH:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Stop warfarin and start heparin: This option is partially correct as it aligns with the practice of switching from warfarin to a safer anticoagulant near delivery. However, the preferred anticoagulant in this situation is LMWH due to its predictable pharmacokinetics and ease of administration.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Stop warfarin and start heparin:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Continue warfarin: This is incorrect because continuing warfarin at 36 weeks of gestation poses significant risks of fetal hemorrhage and warfarin embryopathy. It is essential to switch to a safer anticoagulant like LMWH or UFH close to delivery.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Continue warfarin:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Stop warfarin, start LMWH and aspirin: While this option includes stopping warfarin and starting LMWH, which is correct, the addition of aspirin is only indicated in women who are at a very high risk of thrombosis. The general recommendation does not include aspirin unless there is a specific high-risk indication.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

So, pellagra is more common when maize is the staple diet due to decreased synthesis of Niacin. Pellagra is characterized by 3Ds i.e. diarrhoea, dementia and dermatitis. Death and delirium and depression can also occur.</li><li>\u27a4 Pellagra can also be caused due to Isoniazid therapy as isoniazid inhibits PLP (B6) formation which in turn is required for Niacin synthesis.

A negative antibody test indicates that the woman is not immune to VZV and is susceptible to chickenpox. If a pregnant woman is not immune and has had significant exposure, she is at risk of developing chickenpox and should be administered varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG). VZIG is effective up to 10 days after contact. Symptomatic treatment of chickenpox in pregnancy includes: Oral Acyclovir if within 24 hours of the onset of the rash and if the gestational age is greater than 20 weeks. Intravenous Acyclovir should be given to all pregnant women with severe chickenpox. VZIG has no therapeutic benefit once chickenpox has started. Women who develop chickenpox in pregnancy should be referred to a fetal medicine specialist at 16\u201320 weeks or 5 weeks after infection to look for congenital varicella syndrome. If the infection occurs in the last 4 weeks of pregnancy, there is a risk of varicella infection in the newborn. Planned delivery should normally be avoided for at least 7 days after the onset of the maternal rash to allow for the passive transfer of antibodies from mother to child.</li><li>\u2022 Pregnant women with uncertain or no previous history of chickenpox, who have been exposed to the infection, should have a blood test to determine their immunity to Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV).</li><li>\u2022 A negative antibody test indicates that the woman is not immune to VZV and is susceptible to chickenpox.</li><li>\u2022 If a pregnant woman is not immune and has had significant exposure, she is at risk of developing chickenpox and should be administered varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG).</li><li>\u2022 VZIG is effective up to 10 days after contact.</li><li>\u2022 Symptomatic treatment of chickenpox in pregnancy includes: Oral Acyclovir if within 24 hours of the onset of the rash and if the gestational age is greater than 20 weeks.
