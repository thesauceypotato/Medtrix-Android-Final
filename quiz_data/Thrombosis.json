Heparin is a Hapten, e. an incomplete antigen, and when it combines with Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) , it becomes a complete antigen and can lead to the formation of antibodies. PF4 usually is present on the platelet surface . The antibody then combines with this Heparin-PF4 complex on the platelet surface. This is followed by fibrin binding to this complex and forming a clot . This effect on platelets and endothelial damage induced by antibody binding combine to produce a prothrombotic state , even in the face of heparin administration and low platelet counts (as platelets are deposited in the thrombus thus formed). Thus there is Thrombocytopenia which is induced by heparin . This is seen after 4-14 days of heparin exposure .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
