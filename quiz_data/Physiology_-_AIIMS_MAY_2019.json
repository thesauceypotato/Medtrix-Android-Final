A good marker substance is Non toxic Not metabolized Not excreted very quickly Confined to the compartment of interest Uniformly distributed in that compartment Not prone to changing the distribution of fluid between compartments</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B. Interstitial fluid volume: I-125 labeled albumin is not used for the measurement of interstitial fluid volume. Interstitial fluid is the fluid that surrounds the cells and lies in the spaces between tissues. While albumin is present in the interstitial fluid, the labeled albumin used for plasma volume measurement primarily stays within the blood plasma and does not cross the capillary walls to a significant extent to enter the interstitial fluid. Therefore, it is not a suitable marker for measuring interstitial fluid volume. Option: C. ICF (Intracellular fluid): I-125 labeled albumin is not used for the measurement of intracellular fluid volume. The intracellular fluid is the fluid inside the cells, and labeled albumin injected into the bloodstream is not able to enter the cells and distribute in the intracellular compartment. It remains primarily in the plasma and extracellular fluid compartment. Option: D. ECF (Extracellular fluid): This option is partially correct because I-125 labeled albumin is indeed used for measuring the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume, but more specifically, it measures the plasma volume within the ECF. The ECF includes both the plasma and the interstitial fluid, but since labeled albumin mainly stays within the plasma, it represents the plasma volume rather than the entire ECF volume. Therefore, while I-125 labeled albumin can give an estimate of the plasma volume, it does not provide a direct measurement of the total ECF volume, which would also include the interstitial fluid.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Thyroxine The hormone that is required to cross the plasma membrane for its actions is B. Thyroxine. For its actions, thyroxine needs to cross the plasma membrane and bind to nuclear receptors, which then modulate gene expression and cellular activities.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Thyroxine crosses the plasma membrane for its action. Thyroid hormones are lipophilic in nature and hence can easily cross the plasma membrane to act on nuclear receptors. Epinephrine, glucagon, and insulin bind to cell surface receptors Hormones that bind to intracellular receptors: (Lipophilic, readily penetrate the cell membrane) Androgens. Calcitriol Estrogens. Glucocorticoids. Mineralocorticoids. Thyroid hormones (T3 and T4)</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Options A, C, and D all act through cell surface receptors and do not require crossing the plasma membrane for their actions. Option: A. Epinephrine: Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a hormone and neurotransmitter produced by the adrenal glands. It acts primarily through cell surface receptors called adrenergic receptors, which are located on the surface of target cells. When epinephrine binds to these receptors, it initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling events through second messengers like cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate). These signaling pathways do not require epinephrine to cross the plasma membrane. Instead, the hormone's binding to the cell surface receptors is sufficient to trigger the cellular response. Option: C. Glucagon: Glucagon is a hormone produced by the pancreas that acts to increase blood glucose levels. Like epinephrine, glucagon acts through cell surface receptors on target cells. When glucagon binds to its receptors, it activates intracellular signaling pathways, leading to the release of glucose from liver stores into the bloodstream. Glucagon does not need to cross the plasma membrane to exert its effects. Option: D. Insulin: Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that acts to lower blood glucose levels. It also acts through cell surface receptors on target cells, similar to epinephrine and glucagon. When insulin binds to its receptors, it triggers intracellular signaling pathways that promote glucose uptake by cells and the storage of glucose as glycogen. Insulin does not require crossing the plasma membrane for its actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The action of thyroxine involves the following steps: Thyroxine is synthesized and released from the thyroid gland into the bloodstream. It circulates in the blood bound to carrier proteins. Thyroxine needs to cross the plasma membrane of target cells to exert its effects. Inside the target cells, thyroxine binds to specific nuclear receptors (thyroid hormone receptors) located in the cell nucleus. The hormone-receptor complex acts as a transcription factor, regulating the expression of specific genes in the cell. This gene regulation leads to changes in cellular processes and metabolic activities, affecting various physiological functions.</p>\n<p></p>",

However, thinking about exercise and it resulting in a heart rate increase would be an example of feedforward control mechanism.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Feed forward control is that which makes an anticipatory adaptive response without a specific stimulus. Temperature control via thermoregulatory responses are initiated by the hypothalamus before the changes in environmental temperature changes core body temperature. Thus shivering in response to cold environment would be an example of feed forward control. In the cephalic phase of gastric secretion, the thought of food itself and not food per se  produces a gastric secretion.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B. Cephalic Phase of Gastric Secretion: The cephalic phase is the preparatory phase of gastric secretion that occurs before food even reaches the stomach. Sensory stimuli, such as the sight, smell, and taste of food, activate the brain's response to prepare the stomach for food digestion. The brain signals the stomach to increase secretion of gastric juices and digestive enzymes in anticipation of food intake, which is an example of a feedforward mechanism. Option: C. Cerebellar Action in Motor Coordination: The cerebellum plays a crucial role in coordinating motor movements. Before initiating a movement, the cerebellum receives information from various sensory systems and the cerebral cortex. Based on this information, the cerebellum generates anticipatory motor commands to ensure smooth and coordinated movements. This predictive action of the cerebellum is an example of a feedforward mechanism.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Heart rate is accelerated by :- Decreased activity of arterial baroreceptors Increased activity of atrial stretch receptors Inspiration Excitement Anger Pain Hypoxia Exercise Thyroid hormones Faver The Heart is slowed by Increased activity of arterial baroreceptors Expiration Grief Stimulation of pain fibers in trigeminal nerve Increased intracranial pressure</p>\n<p></p>",

This centre produces rhythmic nerve impulses that contract the muscles responsible for inspiration (diaphragm and external intercostal muscles). The cells bodies of these neurons form the respiratory control centre in the medulla, which sends impulses to stimulate the contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles \u2013 via the phrenic nerve and intercostal nerves respectively.

Pneumotaxic centre: The pneumotaxic center is located in the upper part of the pons.

So, the correct answer is: B & D are true.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mesangial cell contraction can attenuate the glomerular filtration rate by decreasing the renal ultrafiltration coefficient through a decrease in capillary surface area and capillary permeability. Constriction of the efferent arteriole reduces RBF but with an increase in glomerular capillary pressure. This favors a relative increase in the GFR over the RBF, so that the filtration fraction is increased. Contraction of mesangial cells is coupled with contraction of the basement membrane of the endothelium of glomerular capillaries.

Constricting the efferent arteriole would lead to an increase in glomerular hydrostatic pressure and, in turn, an increase in the GFR.
