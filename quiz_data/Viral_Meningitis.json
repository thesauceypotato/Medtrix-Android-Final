However, cerebrospinal fluid usually shows a high neutrophil count. In addition, lower-motor neuron signs such as fasciculations would be atypical. Option D.

Congenital infection may result in the death of the fetus in utero Option C. The classic triad of congenital rubella consists of cataracts, cardiac abnormalities, and deafness . Infants may also display transient symptoms of growth retardation, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and meningoencephalitis. Option D. A pregnant woman with syphilis can transmit T pallidum to the fetus through the placenta beginning in the 10th\u201315th weeks of gestation. Some of the infected fetuses die, and miscarriages result; others are stillborn at term. Others are born in life but develop the signs of congenital syphilis in childhood, including interstitial keratitis, Hutchinson\u2019s teeth, saddle-nose, periostitis, and a variety of central nervous system anomalies.

Virus isolation remains the definitive diagnostic approach. The virus may be isolated from herpetic lesions and may also be found in throat washings, cerebrospinal fluid, and stool, both during primary infection and during asymptomatic periods. Therefore, the isolation of HSV is not in itself sufficient evidence to indicate that the virus is the cause. Option C. Antibodies appear in 4\u20137 days after infection and reach a peak in 2\u20134 weeks. They persist with minor fluctuations for the life of the host. Detection methods available include neutralization, immunofluorescence, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

In Pneumococcal meningitis , CSF leucocytosis with predominant neutrophils occurs with increased CSF protein and markedly reduced CSF glucose level. Option B. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can also cause meningitis and CSF analysis shows marked leucocytosis with predominant lymphocytosis occurs with increased CSF protein and decreased CSF glucose level.
