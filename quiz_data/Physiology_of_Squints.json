      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>It is associated with high myopia. Accommodative esotropia is one of the most common types of strabismus in childhood. The incidence is estimated at 2% of the population. It is usually found in patients with moderate amounts of hyperopia. As the patient accommodates or focuses the eyes, the eyes converge. The over-convergence associated with the accommodation to overcome a hyperopic refractive error can cause a loss of binocular control and lead to the development of esotropia Spectacle correction is the initial treatment for accommodative esotropia .

When an attempt is made to gaze contra laterally (relative to the affected eye), the affected eye adducts minimally, if at all. The contralateral eye abducts, however, with nystagmus. Additionally, the divergence of the eyes leads to horizontal diplopia. That is, if the right eye is affected the patient will \"see double\" when looking to the left, seeing two images side-by-side. Convergence is generally preserved</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Internuclear ophthalmoplegia is an ocular movement disorder caused by a lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. It is characterized by impaired adduction of the ipsilateral eye with nystagmus of the abducting eye. Medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), is a fibre tract responsible for transmitting information that is vital for the coordination of different eye movements. It is a paired white matter tract passing close to the midline, through the brainstem lying ventral to the cerebral aqueduct in the midbrain and the fourth ventricle in the pons and medulla. It is the final common pathway for different types of conjugate eye movements like saccades, smooth pursuit, and vestibulocochlear reflex , and forms a communication between all the ocular motor nuclei Ophthalmoplegia can also occur due to certain toxins . The chief exogenous poisons causing ophthalmoplegia are lead and ptomaines ; the chief toxins, are diphtheria and influenza.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B.

Any squint can show a variation in deviation in upward and downward gaze and, depending on the nature of the squint, an \u2018 A\u2019 or \u2018V\u2019 pattern can be For example, a \u2018V\u2019 pattern is seen in a convergent squint which increases on a downward gaze but in a divergent squint, a \u2018V\u2019 pattern is seen when the deviation is maximum in an upward gaze and less in a downward gaze. The \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018V\u2019 phenomena should be assessed by the cover test in 25\u00b0upward and downward gaze. Etiology : Oblique muscle dysfunction is the commonest cause of AV pattern. Other causes include horizontal rectus muscle dysfunction, vertical muscle dysfunction and certain orbital factors. In general, it is found that the oblique muscles are of more importance in the production of the \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018V \u2019 phenomena than the vertical recti. Usually, overaction of the inferior oblique or weakness of the superior oblique leads to a \u2018V\u2019 pattern and overaction of the superior oblique weakness of the inferior oblique to an \u2018A\u2019 pattern. Weakening and strengthening of the oblique muscles, therefore, are well-recognized methods of influencing the \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018V\u2019 phenomena.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A . A' and 'V' esotropia. In 'A' esotropia the amount of deviation increases in the upward gaze and decreases in the downward gaze . The reverse occurs in 'V' esotropia. The reverse occurs in 'V' exotropia. Option: B . In 'A' exotropia the amount of deviation decreases in the upward gaze and increases in the downward gaze . Clinical presentations Option: D. In a divergent squint a \u2018V\u2019 pattern is seen when the deviation is maximum in the upward gaze and less in the downward gaze.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Length & arc of contact of muscle The power of a muscle is proportional to its length & arc of contact . Retroplacement of the insertion of muscle ( recession) weakens the action of muscle by shortening its effective length & by reducing its arc of contact in various positions of gaze. Advancements in the EOM have a strengthening effect because of the increase in the effective length & arc of contact of the muscle.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
