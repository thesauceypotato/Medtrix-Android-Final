It has an incidence between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 15,000 The most common cause of androgenization in chromosomal 46, XX females. Affected individuals are homozygous or compound heterozygous for severe mutations in the enzyme 21-hydroxylase. This mutation causes a block in adrenal glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis, increasing 17-hydroxyprogesterone and shunting steroid precursors into the androgen synthesis pathway. Glucocorticoid insufficiency causes a compensatory elevation of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), resulting in adrenal hyperplasia and additional synthesis of steroid precursors proximal to the enzymatic block. Increased androgen synthesis in utero causes and reorganization of the 46, XX fetus in the first trimester. Ambiguous genitalia are seen at birth with varying degrees of clitoral enlargement and labial fusion. Excess androgen production causes gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty in males with 21-OHD.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Biochemical Findings Hyponatremia Hypoglycemia Metabolic acidosis Pigmentation Hemoconcentration</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Cortisol deficiency increases secretion of ACTH adrenocortical hyperplasia and overproduction of intermediate metabolites Incomplete virilization or precocious puberty in affected males virilization or sexual infantilism in affected females</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA TYPE of DEFICIENCY 21-HYDROXYLASE 11-8-HYDROXYLASE 17-\u03b1-HYDROXYLASE ALDOSTERONE \u2193 \u2193 \u2191 ANDROGENS \u2191 \u2191 \u2193 BLOOD PRESSURE \u2193 \u2191 \u2191 POTASSIUM \u2191 \u2193 \u2193 SPECIAL FEATURE Salt wasting Increased 11-deoxycorticosterone Excess intermediates are switched to aldosterone pathway</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>CAD/Arteriosclerosis calcified arteries Non-invasive Testing in PAD: The history and physical examination are often sufficient to establish the diagnosis of PAD. An objective assessment of the presence and severity of disease is obtained by non-invasive techniques. Arterial pressure can be recorded noninvasively in the legs by placement of sphygmo manometric cuffs at the ankles and the use of a Doppler device to auscultate or record blood flow from the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. Normally, systolic blood pressure in the legs and arms is similar. Indeed, ankle pressure may be slightly higher than arm pressure due to pulse-wave amplification. In the presence of hemodynamically significant stenoses, the systolic blood pressure in the leg is decreased. Thus, the ratio of the ankle and brachial artery pressures (termed the ankle: brachial index or ABI) is 1.00\u20131.40 in normal individuals. ABI values of 0.91\u20130.99 are considered \u2018borderline,\u2019 and those <0.90 are abnormal and diagnostic of PAD. ABIs >1.40 indicate noncompressible arteries secondary to vascular calcification.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Rockall scoring is used for risk stratification Bleeding peptic ulcer: It is bleeding either from duodenal ulcer, or gastric ulcer or stomal ulcer . In bleeding from stomal ulcer, partial gastrectomy is required. Mortality in bleeding peptic ulcer is high (20\u201330%). Elderly age, associated systemic diseases increase the mortality. NSAIDs and H. pylori infection, coagulopathy and anticoagulant drugs are common precipitating factors. Concomitant use of NSAID and steroids increase risk by 10-fold. Need of more than 5 units of blood transfusion during hospital stay is called as massive hemorrhage . Bleeding duodenal ulcer: 10% common. Risk of bleeding in chronic duodenal ulcer increases to 35% if patient has not taken specific anti- Helicobacter pylori therapy and PPI. Bleeding from DU is either from the small vessels in the wall of ulcer crater or due to erosion into the gastroduodenal artery . Usually posterior duodenal ulcer bleeds. Bleeding from small vessels in the wall of ulcer is due to sloughing of the ulcer. It is less severe, gradual and most often well-controlled by conservative treatment. Bleeding from erosion of gastroduodenal artery is severe, torrential and almost always needs early surgical intervention. Clinical features: Hematemesis and melena. Features of shock: Pallor, tachycardia, sweating, hypotension, tachypnea, dry tongue, cold periphery. Past history of chronic DU may be present. History of pain and tenderness in epigastric region which has increased in intensity recently. \u2022 Investigations: To look for in endoscopy, in bleeding ulcer \u2013 Spurter \u2013 Clot \u2013 Visible vessel \u2013 Aneurysmal dilatation of the arteriole in the wall of ulcer \u2013 Ooze Gastroscopy is confirmative: It is a must. It identifies ulcer bleed in 90% of cases clearly. Possibility of rebleed is also assessed by endoscopy. A flat clear based ulcer is less likely to rebleed. Active ulcer/fresh clot/visible vessel/ pseudoaneurysm/large ulcer are more likely to rebleed. Rockall scoring system is used to predict rebleed. Celiac angiogram to identify the bleeder may be helpful. Hb% and PCV\u2014should be repeated at regular intervals (once in 2\u20133 hours). Blood group and cross-matching. Estimation of serum electrolytes, blood urea, serum creatinine, platelet count. Treatment: Seventy percent of bleeding duodenal ulcers are treated conservatively. The shock is corrected initially by: Foot end elevation, IV fluids, plasma expanders (Haemaccel, dextran, crystalloids). Catheterization\u2014to assess urine output. Blood transfusion to replace the lost blood. Stomach wash is given\u20141:2,00,000 adrenaline in saline wash is given to the stomach through Ryle\u2019s tube. IV ranitidine 50 mg 6th or 8th hourly. IV pantoprazole 80 mg in 100 ml dextrose saline is given slow IV as starting dose and later 40 mg in dextrose saline IV OD/BD. Slow continuous infusion of pantoprazole 40 mg in dextrose saline, 500 ml IV can also be given. Endoscopic cauterization of small vessel with either gastroscopic bipolar cautery or through laser or through heater probe or through hemoclips can be tried to stop the bleeding. Sclerotherapy \u2014ethanolamine oleate, distilled water. Epinephrine injection is also used commonly. Other agents used are absolute alcohol, polidocanol. Observation is done for patients with bleeding from small vessels in the wall of DU will commonly respond to conservative treatment. Angiographic embolization of gastroduodenal artery. Surgery: After laparotomy, pyloric channel and first part of the duodenum (gastro duodenum) is opened longitudinally, bleeder is identified. Underrunning of the bleeding area with Vicryl is done. If the bleed is from gastroduodenal artery, then it has to be ligated to stop the bleeding. Opened gastro duodenum is closed by Finney\u2019s pyloroplasty. Truncal vagotomy may be done together, if the general condition of the patient is good.</p>\n<p></p>",

The ataxia indicates involvement of the red nucleus or dentatorubrothalamic tract ; the hemiplegia is localized to the cerebral peduncle. If the subthalamic nucleus is involved, contralateral hemiballismus may occur. Occlusion of the artery of Percheron produces paresis of upward gaze and drowsiness and often abulia . Extensive infarction in the midbrain and subthalamus occurring with bilateral proximal PCA occlusion presents as coma, unreactive pupils, bilateral pyramidal signs, and decerebrate rigidity. The thalamic or Dejerine-Roussy syndrome consists of:- contralateral hemisensory loss followed later by an agonizing, searing or burning pain in the affected areas. It is persistent and responds poorly to analgesics. Anticonvulsants (carbamazepine or gabapentin) or tricyclic antidepressants may be beneficial. P2 syndromes: Occlusion of the distal PCA causes infarction of the medial temporal and occipital lobes. Contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing is the usual manifestation . Medial temporal lobe and hippocampal involvement may cause an acute disturbance in memory, particularly if it occurs in the dominant hemisphere . The defect usually clears because memory has bilateral representation. If the dominant hemisphere is affected and the infarct extends to involve the splenium of the corpus callosum , the patient may demonstrate:- alexia without agraphia Visual agnosia for faces, objects, mathematical symbols, and colors and anomia with paraphasic errors (amnestic aphasia) Occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery can produce peduncular hallucinosis (visual hallucinations of brightly colored scenes and objects).</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Syndrome Level of Lesion Features Weber Syndrome7 Cerebral peduncle Ipsilateral III nerve palsy + Contralateral hemiparesis Benedikt Syndrome7 Red Nucleus Ipsilateral III nerve palsy + Contralateral extrapyramidal signs Nothnagel Syndrome7 Fasciculus + Superior Cerebral Peduncle Ipsilateral III nerve palsy + Cerebellar Ataxia Claude Syndrome7 Combination of Benedikt and Nothnagel syndrome</p>\n<p></p>",

Diagnosis of Wilson\u2019s disease: Serum ceruloplasmin levels should not be used for definitive diagnosis because they are normal in up to 10% of affected patients and are reduced in 20% of carriers. Kayser-Fleischer rings can be definitively diagnosed only by an ophthalmologist using a slit-lamp. They are present in >99% of patients with neurologic/psychiatric forms of the disease and have been described very rarely in the absence of Wilson\u2019s disease. They are present in only ~30\u201350% of patients diagnosed in the hepatic or presymptomatic state; thus, the absence of rings does not exclude the diagnosis. Urine copper measurement is an important  diagnostic  tool, but urine must be collected carefully to avoid contamination. Symptomatic patients invariably have urine copper levels >1.6 \u03bcmol (>100 \u03bcg) per 24 h. Heterozygotes have values <1.3 \u03bcmol (<80 \u03bcg) per 24  h.  About  half  of  presymptomatic patients who are ultimately affected have diagnostically elevated urine copper values, but the other half have levels that are in an intermediate range between 0.9 and 1.6 \u03bcmol (60\u2013100 \u03bcg) per 24 h. Because heterozygotes may have values up to 1.3 \u03bcmol (80 \u03bcg) per 24 h, patients in this range   may require a liver biopsy for definitive diagnosis. The gold standard for diagnosis remains liver biopsy with quantitative copper assays. Affected patients have values >3.1 \u03bcmol/g [>200 \u03bcg/g (dry weight) of liver]. Copper stains are not reliable. False positive results can occur with longstanding obstructive liver disease which can elevate hepatic and urine copper concentrations and rarely causes Kayser-Fleischer rings.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>13 A recent study has examined the literature on starvation using body mass index (BMI) to define the limits of human survival  to starvation. Data included is based on normal weight subjects who died from starvation, famine or anorexia nervosa. Despite the diversity of sources, the data shows a remarkable consistency. In particular, the review illustrates a sex difference in the limits of survival when based on BMI classification. In males, a BMI of around 13 appears to be fatal. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the BMI is 8.7%. In contrast, females survive to a lower BMI of around 11, although with greater index variability (CV 14%). Several females had BMI\u2019s as low as 9 and 10. Based on these figures a mean BMI of 12 as the lower limit for human survival emerges. The ability of females to withstand a greater degree of food deprivation may be due to the following reasons: Females have greater body stores of fat than males, and this can be used as a source of energy for a much longer period (fat is more energy dense than protein) The contribution of fat energy to total energy expenditure   is greater in the female resulting in a greater conservation of protein Females appear better able to mobilize adipose tissue from most sites in the body.</p>\n<p></p>",

PPCM is a dilated form of the condition which means  the heart chambers enlarge and the muscle weakens. This causes a decrease in the percentage of blood ejected from the left ventricle of the heart with each contraction.

The patient is made NPO to rest the pancreas and is given intravenous narcotic analgesics to control abdominal pain and supplemental oxygen (2 L) via nasal cannula. Intravenous fluids of lactated Ringer\u2019s or normal saline are initially bolused at 15\u201320 cc/kg (1050\u20131400 mL), followed by 3 mg/kg per hour (200\u2013250 mL/h), to maintain urine output >0.5 cc/kg per hour. Serial bedside evaluations are required every 6\u20138 h to assess vital signs, oxygen saturation, and change in physical examination. Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution has been shown to decrease systemic inflammation and may be a better crystalloid than normal saline. A targeted resuscitation strategy with measurement of hematocrit and BUN every 8\u201312 h is recommended to ensure adequacy of fluid resuscitation and monitor response to therapy, noting less aggressive resuscitation strategy may be needed in milder forms of pancreatitis. A rising BUN during hospitalization is not only associated with inadequate hydration but also higher in hospital mortality. A decrease in hematocrit and BUN during the first 12\u201324 h is strong evidence that sufficient fluids are being administered. Serial measurements and bedside assessment for fluid overload are continued, and fluid rates are maintained at the current rate. Adjustments in fluid resuscitation may be required in patients with cardiac, pulmonary, or renal disease. A rise in hematocrit or BUN during serial measurement should be treated with a repeat volume challenge with a 2-L crystalloid bolus followed by increasing the fluid rate by 1.5 mg/kg per hour. If the BUN or hematocrit fails to respond (i.e. remains elevated or does not decrease) to this bolus challenge and increase in fluid rate, consideration of transfer to an intensive care unit is strongly recommended for hemodynamic monitoring.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Sickle cell anemia Sickle cell disease: It is associated with several musculoskeletal abnormalities. Children under the age of 5 years may develop diffuse swelling, tenderness, and warmth of the hands and feet lasting 1\u20133 weeks. This condition referred to as sickle cell dactylitis or hand-foot syndrome , has also been observed in sickle cell thalassemia. Dactylitis is believed to result from infarction of the bone marrow and cortical bone leading to periostitis and soft tissue swelling. Radiographs show periosteal elevation, subperiosteal new-bone formation, and areas of radiolucency and increased density involving the metacarpals, metatarsals, and proximal phalanges. These bone changes disappear after several months. The syndrome leaves little or no residual damage. Because hematopoiesis ceases in the small bones of the hands and feet with age, the syndrome is rarely seen after age 5. Sickle cell crisis is associated with periarticular pain and occasionally with joint effusions. The joint and periarticular area are warm and tender. Knees and elbows are most often affected, but other joints can be involved. Joint effusions are usually noninflammatory. Acute synovial infarction can cause a sterile effusion with high neutrophil counts in synovial fluid. Synovial biopsies have shown mild lining-cell proliferation and microvascular thrombosis with infarctions. Scintigraphic studies have shown decreased marrow uptake adjacent to the involved joint. Patients with sickle cell disease seem predisposed to osteomyelitis, which commonly involves the long tubular bones. Salmonella is a particularly common cause. Radiographs of the involved site initially show periosteal elevation, with subsequent disruption of the cortex. Treatment of the infection results in healing of the bone lesion. In addition, sickle cell disease is associated with bone infarction resulting from vaso-occlusion secondary to the sickling of red cells. Bone infarction also occurs in hemoglobin sickle cell disease and sickle cell thalassemia. The bone pain in sickle cell crisis is due to infarction of bone and bone marrow. In children, infarction of the epiphyseal growth plate interferes with normal growth of the affected extremity. Radiographically, infarction of the bone cortex results in periosteal elevation and irregular thickening of the bone cortex. Infarction in the bone marrow leads to lysis, fibrosis, and new bone formation.</p>\n<p></p>",

Crohn\u2019s disease: Microscopic features: The earliest lesions are aphthous ulcerations and focal crypt abscesses with loose aggregations of macrophages, which form non-caseating granulomas in all layers of the bowel wall. Granulomas can be seen in lymph nodes, mesentery, peritoneum, liver, and pancreas. Although granulomas are a pathognomonic feature of CD, they are rarely found on mucosal biopsies. Surgical resection reveals granulomas in about one- half of cases. Other histologic features of CD include submucosal or subserosal lymphoid aggregates, particularly away from the areas of ulceration, gross and microscopic skip areas, and transmural inflammation that is accompanied by fissures that penetrate deeply into the bowel wall and sometimes form fistulous tracts or local abscesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In mild disease, aphthous or small superficial ulcerations are found In more active diseases, stellate ulcerations fuse longitudinally and transversely to demarcate mucosa islands that are frequently histologically normal.

A-T is caused by a defect in the ATM gene, which is responsible for managing the cell\u2019s response to multiple forms of stress including double-strand breaks in DNA. The protein produced by the ATM gene recognizes that there  is a break in DNA, recruits other proteins to fix the break,  and stops the cell from making new DNA until the repair is complete. The condition occurs in about 1 in 70,000 people. Symptoms: Ataxia (difficulty with control of movement) that is apparent early but worsens in school to preteen years. Oculomotor apraxia (difficulty with coordination of head and eye movement when shifting gaze from one place to the next). Involuntary movements. Telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels) over the white  (sclera) of the eyes, making them appear bloodshot. These are not apparent in infancy and may first appear at age 5-8 years. Telangiectasia may also appear on sun-exposed areas of skin. Problems with infections, especially of the ears, sinuses and lungs Increased incidence of cancer (primarily, but not exclusively, lymphomas and leukemias). Delayed onset or incomplete pubertal development, and very early menopause. Slowed rate of growth (weight and/or height). Drooling particularly in young children when they are tired or concentrating on activities. Dysarthria (slurred, slow, or distorted speech sounds). Diabetes in adolescence or later. Premature changes in hair and skin.</p>\n<p></p>",

The disease entity is no longer commonly diagnosed because such heavy metal exposure has been greatly reduced due to the known health risks from lead and the consequent removal of lead from most commercial product and fuels. Nonetheless, occupational exposure is possible in workers involved in the manufacture or destruction of batteries, removal of lead paint, or manufacture of alloys and electrical equipment (cadmium) in countries where industrial regulation is less stringent. In addition, ingestion of moonshine whiskey distilled in lead- tainted containers has been one of the more frequent sources of lead exposure. Early signs of chronic lead intoxication are attributable to proximal tubule dysfunction, particularly hyperuricemia as a result of diminished urate secretion. The triad of \u201csaturnine gout,\u201d hypertension, and renal insufficiency should prompt a practitioner to ask specifically about lead exposure. Unfortunately, evaluating lead burden is not as straightforward as ordering a blood test; the preferred methods involve measuring urinary lead after infusion of a chelating agent or by radiographic fluoroscopy of bone. Several recent studies have shown an association between  chronic low-level lead exposure and decreased renal function, although either of these two factors may have been the primary event. In those patients who have CIN of unclear origin and  an elevated total body lead burden, repeated treatments of lead chelation therapy have been shown to slow the decline   in renal function.</p>\n<p></p>",

In the severe and moderate forms, the disease is characterized by bleeding into the joints (hemarthrosis), soft tissues, and muscles after minor trauma or even spontaneously The disease is more evident when children begin to walk or crawl. In the severe form, the most common bleeding manifestations are recurrent hemarthrosis, affecting primarily the knees, elbows, ankles, shoulders, and hips Hemarthroses and spontaneous muscle hematomas are characteristic of moderate or severe congenital factor VIII or IX deficiency. They can also be seen in moderate and severe deficiencies of fibrinogen, prothrombin, and factors V, VII, and X. Spontaneous hemarthrosis occur rarely in other bleeding disorders except for severe VWD with associated factor VIII levels <5%. Muscle and soft tissue bleeds are also common in acquired factor VIII deficiency. Bleeding into a joint results in severe pain and swelling, as well as loss of function, but is rarely associated with discoloration from bruising around the joint. Life-threatening sites of bleeding include bleeding into the oropharynx, where bleeding can obstruct the airway into the central nervous system, and into the retroperitoneum.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Low dietary intake Vitamin K: There are two natural forms of vitamin K: vitamin K1 also known as phylloquinone , from vegetable and animal sources, and vitamin K2, or menaquinone , which is synthesized by bacterial flora and found in hepatic tissue. Phylloquinone can be converted to menaquinone in some organs. Vitamin K is required for the post-translational carboxylation of glutamic acid, which is necessary for calcium binding to \u03b3-carboxylated proteins such as prothrombin (factor II); factors VII, IX, and X; protein C; protein S; and proteins found     in bone (osteocalcin) and vascular smooth muscle (e.g. matrix Gla protein). Dietary sources: It is found in green leafy vegetables such as kale and spinach, and appreciable amounts are also present in margarine and liver. It is present in vegetable oils; olive, canola, and soybean oils are particularly rich sources. Deficiency: The symptoms of vitamin K deficiency are due to hemorrhage; newborns are particularly susceptible because of low fat stores, low breast milk levels of vitamin K, relative sterility of the infantile intestinal tract, liver immaturity, and poor placental transport. Intracranial bleeding as well as gastrointestinal and skin bleeding can occur in vitamin K\u2013deficient infants 1\u20137 days after birth. Thus, vitamin K (0.5\u20131 mg IM) is given prophylactically at delivery. Vitamin K deficiency in adults may be seen in patients with chronic small-intestinal disease (e.g. celiac disease, Crohn\u2019s disease), in those with obstructed biliary tracts, or after small- bowel resection. Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment can precipitate vitamin K deficiency by reducing numbers of gut bacteria which synthesize menaquinone, and by inhibiting the metabolism of vitamin K. In patients with warfarin therapy, the anti-obesity drug orlistat can lead to international normalized ratio changes due to vitamin K malabsorption. Vitamin K deficiency is usually diagnosed on the basis of an elevated prothrombin time or reduced clotting factors, although vitamin K may also be measured directly by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Vitamin K deficiency is treated with a parenteral dose of 10 mg. For patients with chronic malabsorption, 1\u20132 mg/d should be given orally or 1\u20132 mg per week can be taken parenterally. Patients with liver disease may have an elevated prothrombin time because of liver cell destruction as well as vitamin K deficiency. If an elevated prothrombin time does not improve during vitamin K therapy, it can be deduced that this abnormality is not the result of vitamin K deficiency. Inherited deficiency of the functional activity of the enzymes involved in vitamin K metabolism, notably the GGCX or VKORC1 results in bleeding disorders. The amount of vitamin K in the diet is often limiting for the carboxylation reaction; thus recycling of the vitamin K is essential to maintain normal levels of vitamin K\u2013dependent proteins. In adults, low dietary intake alone is seldom reason for severe vitamin K deficiency but may become common in association with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Disease or surgical interventions that affect the ability of the intestinal tract to absorb vitamin K, either through anatomic alterations or by changing the fat content of bile salts and pancreatic juices in the proximal small bowel can result in significant reduction of vitamin K levels. Prolongation of PT values is the most  common  and  earliest finding in vitamin K\u2013deficient patients due to reduction in prothrombin, FVII, FIX, and FX levels. FVII has the shortest half-life among these factors that can prolong the PT before  changes in the  aPTT. Parenteral administration of vitamin K at a total dose of 10 mg is sufficient to restore normal levels of clotting factor within 8\u201310 h. In the presence of ongoing bleeding or a need for immediate correction before an invasive procedure, replace- ment with FFP or PCC is required.</p>\n<p></p>",

Transient vasospasm: Multiple simultaneous spasms of coronary arteries could cause enough loss of blood flow to cause transient stunning of the myocardium.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Ballooning of left ventricular apex (octopus pot-shaped) Transient systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS: Hypotension Ventricular rupture Thrombosis involving the LV apex Torsades de pointes</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Presentations include:- pulmonary edema, hypotension, and chest pain with ECG changes mimicking an acute infarction . The left ventricular dysfunction extends beyond a specific coronary artery distribution and generally resolves within days to weeks. This acute cardiomyopathy may result from intense sympathetic activation with heterogeneity of myocardial autonomic innervation, diffuse microvascular spasm , and/or direct catecholamine toxicity. Coronary angiography may be required to rule out acute coronary occlusion. No therapies have been proven beneficial, but reasonable strategies include:- Nitrates for pulmonary edema, intra aortic balloon pump if needed for low output, combined alpha and beta blockers rather than selective beta blockade if hemodynamically stable, magnesium for arrhythmias related to QT prolongation. Anticoagulation is generally withheld due to the occasional occurrence of ventricular rupture. While the prognosis is generally good , recurrences have been described in up to 10%  of patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Modified Mayo Clinic criteria - LV regional wall-motion abnormalities - Absence of coronary lesion - ECG abnormalities OR \u2191 troponin levels - Absence of pheochromocytoma and myocarditis Diagnostic hints - ST-segment elevation - T-wave inversion - \u2191 Cardiac enzyme levels - \u2193 LVEF - Close prior stressful event Faster recovery Symptoms Chest pain Dyspnea Palpitations Syncope Cardiogenic Shock</p>\n<p></p>",
