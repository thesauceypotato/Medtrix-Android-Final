In the acute setting, the first line treatment for a panic attack is a benzodiazepine, which can provide immediate relief from acute symptoms. Benzodiazepines can be administered orally in this case as the patient is conscious, cooperative, and able to swallow. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and SSRIs are effective for long-term management of panic disorder, but they do not provide the immediate relief that is necessary in an acute panic attack.

The specimen is illuminated with light of a specific band, which is absorbed by the fluorescent dye, causing it to emit light of a weaker band and hence a different color. In a properly configured microscope, only the emission light should reach the eye or detector and not the illuminating light scattered by the background This produces a high contrast image where the fluorescent structures are superimposed on a dark background.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 In 1996, the International Continence Society defined the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system. Prolapse in each segment is measured relative to the hymen, which is an anatomic landmark that can be identified consistently. Six points are located with reference to the plane of the hymen: two on the anterior vaginal wall (points Aa and Ba), two at the apical vagina (points C and D), and two on the posterior vaginal wall (points Ap and Bp) The genital hiatus (Gh), perineal body (Pb), and total vaginal length (TVL) are also measured. All POP-Q points, except TVL, are measured during patient Valsalva and should reflect maximum protrusion. Anterior Vaginal Wall Points Point Aa defines a point that lies in the midline of the anterior vaginal wall and is 3 cm proximal to the external urethral meatus. This corresponds to the proximal location of the urethra-vesical crease. Point Ba represents the most distal position of any part of the upper anterior vaginal wall, that is, the segment of vagina that normally would extend cephalad rom point Aa.
