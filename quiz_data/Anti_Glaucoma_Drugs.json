Aphakic glaucoma is typically an open - angle glaucoma , adding weight to the proposition that an interaction occurs between trabecular meshwork cells and lens epithelial cells and/or the vitreous, leading to the development of elevated intraocular pressure Statement: B. Pigmentary glaucoma is a type of secondary open - angle glaucoma. Characterized by heavy homogeneous pigmentation of the trabecular meshwork, iris transillumination defects, and pigment along the corneal endothelium ( Krukenberg spindle ). Statement: C. Uveitic glaucoma is a common complication of uveitis, affecting some 20% of patients. The term \u201cuveitic glaucoma\u201d is used to describe glaucoma resulting indirectly or directly from uveitis Glaucoma is more commonly associated anterior uveitis and with chronic forms of uveitis. Statement: D. Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma , or pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, is the same condition with the addition of elevated eye pressure and evidence of damage to the optic nerve. Pseudoexfoliation is not to be confused with \u201c true exfoliation, \u201dwhich is due to heat or infrared exposure (and which can be found among glassblowers). Pseudoexfoliation syndrome is a systemic disorder in which a fibrillar, proteinaceous substance is produced in abnormally high concentrations within ocular tissues.

Hypotony is common when drainage implants are installed in a one-stage procedure without complete tube occlusion. The absence of any resistance to aqueous outflow invariably results in a reduction of IOP to below physiologic levels. A two-stage procedure has been recommended to limit early hypotony. During the first operation, the scleral plate is sutured to the globe without connecting the tube to the anterior chamber. This procedure is followed by a second operation 2 to 8 weeks later, during which the tube is inserted into the anterior chamber. An alternative to limiting over filtration after one-stage installation involves the temporary occlusion of the tube lumen with a ligature or with semipermeable, biodegradable collagen lacrimal plugs.</p>\n<p></p>",

Timolol is a nonselective beta blocker that is used as an ophthalmic formulation for the treatment of open - angle glaucoma . It blocks \u00df2 receptors in the ciliary body of the eye, decreasing aqueous humor production and consequently lowering intraocular pressure. However, because timolol is passively absorbed into the systemic circulation from the eye, it has high bioavailability, potentially leading to systemic side effects such as the blockade of \u00df1 receptors in the heart and subsequent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects.

Option: C . Tropicamide , an anticholinergic medication, is used commonly as a mydriatic agent. Pupillary dilation can precipitate angle-closure glaucoma in predisposed individuals and is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma. Moreover, tachycardia, not bradycardia, is a side effect of tropicamide, making a different agent more likely. Option: D . Pilocarpine , a cholinergic agonist that primarily acts on M3 muscarinic receptors, reduces intraocular pressure by increasing the trabecular outflow of aqueous humor.
