She is of normal height, at the top of her class but her mother is concerned because of a sudden increase in hair growth and hoarseness of voice. She also mentions that she hasn\u2019t yet attained menarche. On examination, there is absent breast development and minimal presence of pubic and axillary hair. There is also increased facial hair growth and on local examination, there is an enlarged clitoris. An ultrasound reveals an absent uterus with the presence of gonad-like structures in the inguinal canal. Suspecting 5 alpha reductase deficiency, testosterone and DHT level is done. What is the expected finding in 5 alpha reductase deficiency?",
