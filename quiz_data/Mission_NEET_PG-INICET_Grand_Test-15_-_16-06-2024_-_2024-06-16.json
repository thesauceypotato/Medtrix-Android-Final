Low Vd mean less drug is distributed to tissues whereas high value of Vd means drug is being stored in some tissue. A large apparent volume of distribution (Vd) suggests that a drug is extensively distributed into and stored in body tissues rather than remaining in the plasma. Volume of distribution is the hypothetical volume of plasma that would be required to contain the administered dose if that dose was evenly distributed at the concentration measured in plasma. If more amount of drug is entering the tissues, it has a higher volume of distribution and vice-a-versa.
