His medical history was remarkable for asthma since childhood; he was treated with beta-agonists, ipratropium, and orally administered corticosteroids. On evaluation, he was febrile and ill-appearing. His chest examination revealed diffuse wheezing and bilateral crackles. He was diagnosed as having community-acquired pneumonia and asthma exacerbation and was started on empiric antibiotics, nebulized beta-agonists, and orally administered corticosteroids. His clinical status continued deteriorating and he became critically ill despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals. Considering the epidemiological background of our patient, bronchoalveolar and faecal samples were obtained to investigate soil-transmitted helminths. Rhabditiform larvae of Ovoviviparous helminths were found in both specimens. All the following statements are true regarding the causative organism except?",

These larvae penetrate the intestine, migrate throughout the circulatory system, enter the lungs and heart (similar to the migration of hookworms upon penetrating skin), and develop into parasitic females in the intestine. These nematodes are able to sustain an infection for many years and, if immunosuppressed, produce hyperinflation which is fulminating and fatal . Disseminated infections are mainly involved in the gastrointestinal tract (severe diarrhoea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, vomiting), lungs (coughing, wheezing, hemoptysis), and s kin (rash, pruritus, larva currens). Larvae migrating from the intestine carrying enteric bacteria can cause local infections or sepsis, resulting in death.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options A, C and D.
