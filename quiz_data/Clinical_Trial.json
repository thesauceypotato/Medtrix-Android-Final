Phase 1 clinical trial is the first phase of three or four phases of research studies used to test a new treatment on humans. The major goal of a clinical trial is to determine whether a drug or procedure is safe for human use. Option:B. Phase 2 trials are designed to determine whether the new treatment has sufficiently promising efficacy to warrant further investigation in a large-scale randomized phase 3 trial, as well as to further assess safety. These studies usually involve a few hundred patients. Option:D. Phase 0 of a clinical trial is done with a very small number of people, usually fewer than 15. Investigators use a very small dose of medication to make sure it isn\u2019t harmful to humans before they start using it in higher doses for later phases.</p>\n<p></p>",
