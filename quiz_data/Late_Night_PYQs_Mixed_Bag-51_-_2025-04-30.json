PUV is a membranous fold located in the posterior urethra, typically found just distal to the verumontanum. It is thought to occur due to the persistence of the urogenital membrane. Urethral obstruction can cause dilation of the posterior urethral valve, bladder, and bilateral hydronephrosis, leading to a keyhole sign on prenatal ultrasound and potentially oligohydramnios. If not detected prenatally, PUV may present postnatally as a newborn or young infant with urinary tract symptoms, abdominal distension or and recurrent UTIs. Left untreated, PUV may result in chronic kidney disease, bladder dysfunction, and vesicoureteral reflux. Diagnosis of PUV is typically based on the presence of an elongated posterior valve during the voiding phase of the voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG).</li><li>\u27a4 The most frequent cause of bladder outflow obstruction in male children is the posterior urethral valve (PUV).</li><li>\u27a4 PUV is a membranous fold located in the posterior urethra, typically found just distal to the verumontanum.

D. 50 Hz</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 This is the frequency typically used for tetanic stimulation in neuromuscular monitoring. A stimulation of 50 Hz for 5 seconds results in a tetanic contraction. If the patient is under profound neuromuscular blockade, no contraction will be observed. If there's some recovery from blockade, a contraction will be noted but may be weaker than in a patient with no blockade. Fade during or after tetanic stimulation can indicate incomplete recovery from blockade.</li><li>\u2022 Tetanic stimulation is a method used in neuromuscular monitoring to assess the degree of neuromuscular blockade in patients who have received neuromuscular blocking agents (often used during surgeries to produce muscle paralysis). Tetanic stimulation involves giving a high-frequency series of electrical impulses to a peripheral nerve to cause sustained muscle contraction. The response to tetanic stimulation can help determine the depth of neuromuscular blockade and the presence of fade.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 0.2 Hz : This frequency is more representative of a \"single twitch\" stimulation, where one stimulus is delivered every 5 seconds. It is used to monitor the initial onset and the later stages of recovery from neuromuscular blockade.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 0.2 Hz</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 2 Hz : This refers to a train-of-four (TOF) stimulation where four stimuli are given at a frequency of 2 Hz (2 stimuli per second). It's a common method of monitoring neuromuscular blockade, especially when assessing for residual blockade. A fading response in the TOF is indicative of neuromuscular blockade.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 2 Hz</li><li>\u2022 Option C. 20 Hz : This isn't a standard frequency for neuromuscular monitoring.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. 20 Hz</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective :</li><li>\u27a4 The frequency of tetanic stimulation used in neuromuscular monitoring is typically 50 Hz.</li><li>\u27a4 PATTERN OF NERVE STIMULATION:</li><li>\u27a4 PATTERN OF NERVE STIMULATION:</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Miller\u2019s Anesthesia, 9 th Ed.

This clinical scenario suggests the presence of an ectopic ACTH-producing tumor, most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer.</li><li>\u2022 In such cases, the excessive ACTH produced by the tumor can lead to Cushing's syndrome.</li><li>\u2022 Additionally, ACTH has an intrinsic MSH (Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone) activity due to the shared precursor molecule, proopiomelanocortin (POMC). The MSH part within ACTH stimulates melanocytes, leading to increased melanin production and resulting in hyperpigmentation.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.
