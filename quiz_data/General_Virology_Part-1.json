These variant strains differ primarily at hypervariable genomic regions, such as those in the sequences encoding its two envelope glycoproteins. Moreover, there is no proofreading 3'-->5' exonuclease activity built into the virion-encoded RNA polymerase . As a result, the RNA polymerase makes many errors during replication, and several dozen subspecies of HCV are typically present in the blood of an infected individual at any one time.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B. 5'-->3' exonuclease activity allows DNA polymerase I to engage in nick translation, which is essential for both DNA repair and the removal of RNA primers during replication. This feature is not the cause of instability in HCV. Option C. DNA glycosylase is important in base excision repair as it removes the nitrogen base from the sugar-phosphate backbone. An endonuclease then completes the remainder of the repair. This enzyme is not the cause of instability in HCV. Option D. DNA ligase is used to join 2 fragments of DNA and is therefore necessary for both DNA repair and replication. The HCV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecule that does not require ligase activity during replication.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Inhibiting viral genome replication and assembly Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-borne pathogen that is primarily transmitted via injection drug use or transfusion of blood products (prior to widespread screening in 1992). Chronic infection develops in most individuals and increases the risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Because chronic HCV infection is often asymptomatic for decades, patients are often unaware that they have contracted the virus. Therefore, HCV testing is recommended for high-risk patients (eg, remote history of blood transfusion). Treatment of chronic HCV infection is with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents , which target specific enzymes in the HCV life cycle to inhibit viral replication and assembly, as follows: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors - HCV binds to and enters host cells, uncoats, and subsequently replicates its genome using HCV-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Nucleotide/non-nucleoside RNA polymerase inhibitors such as sofosbuvir target this step. Protease inhibitors - HCV mRNA is translated by host ribosomes into a polyprotein, which is cleaved by HCV protease into the individual proteins that compose the virus. HCV protease inhibitors such as simeprevir target this step. NS5A inhibitors - The HCV protein NS5A is crucial for viral replication and assembly (through unclear mechanisms) and is targeted by HCV medications such as ledipasvir. DAA treatment results in a sustained virologic response (complete elimination of virus) in >97% of treated individuals.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. HCV does not contain a reverse transcriptase enzyme so it does not integrate its genome into the host cell. Therefore, there are no reverse transcriptase inhibitors for HCV. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors are a mainstay of therapy for HIV. Option B. Interferon-gamma was previously used in the treatment of chronic HCV (in combination with ribavirin) to trigger a broad antiviral immune response. However, interferon therapy has a lower cure rate (50%-80%) and a much higher incidence of side effects (eg, flu-like symptoms). Therefore, DAAs are now used preferentiall Option C. HIV fusion inhibitors (eg, enfuvirtide} and CCR5 inhibitors (eg, maraviroc) inhibit the ability of HIV to enter cells. DAAs do not target viral entries.</p>\n<p></p>",

Anti-HAV lgM is positive and is a marker of active disease. Hepatitis A infection is a self-limiting disease and does not progress to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment is largely supportive, with complete recovery expected in 3-6 weeks. People considered at high risk (eg, those living in or traveling to endemic areas, those with chronic liver disease or clotting factor disorders, men who have sex with men) should be given the hepatitis A vaccine as prophylaxis.

This virus is spread through sexual and nonsexual contact with body secretions. CMV infection, serum sickness, or another viral illness rarely causes a false-positive heterophile antibody test (monospot test). The best diagnostic test for establishing CMV mononucleosis is serology for CMV IgM antibodies, which should be positive in the majority of patients during the symptomatic phase of the illness. A positive test means heterophile antibodies are present. These are most often a sign of mononucleosis . Although a positive heterophile antibody is widely accepted as a diagnosis of acute mononucleosis due to EBV infection, physicians should keep in mind that the results can still be falsely positive in many conditions including CMV infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A, B and C.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Influenza Antigenic variability is highest in influenza virus type A and less in type B, while it has not been demonstrated in type C. The internal RNP (Ribonucleoproteins) antigen and M protein antigen are stable but both surface antigens undergo independent antigenic variations , which may be of two types: Antigenic shift and drift. Antigenic shift results from gene reassortments . Antigenic drift results from accumulations of point mutations occurring sequentially.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A, C and D. Antigenic drift is not seen in these options ANTIGENIC DRIFT VERSUS ANTIGENIC SHIFT ANTIGENIC DRIFT ANTIGENIC SHIFT A mechanism for variation by viruses, which involves the accumulation of mutations within the antigen-binding sites A sudden shift in the antigenicity of a virus resulting from the combination of the genomes of two viral strains The variation in the antigenic pool is by the accumulation of gene mutations Two different strains of viruses combine to form a new subtype A minor antigenic change A major antigenic change Results in a new viral strain Results in a new subtype of the virus Occurs frequently Occurs once in a time The new viral strain may infect the hosts of the same species The new viral subtype may infect another host in a different species Easy to treat Difficult to treat Occurs in Influenza virus A, B, and C Occurs in Influenza virus A Gives rise to epidemics between pandemics Gives rise to pandemics Visit www.PEDIAA.com</p>\n<p></p>",
