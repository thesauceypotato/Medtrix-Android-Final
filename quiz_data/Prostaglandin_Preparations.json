Three months ago, she underwent heart transplantation for restrictive cardiomyopathy and was started on transplant rejection prophylaxis. Her pulse is 76/min and her blood pressure is 148/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows an enlargement of the gum tissue. There is a well-healed scar on her chest. Serum studies show hyperlipidemia. The physician recommends removing a drug that decreases T cell activation by inhibiting the transcription of interleukin-2 from the patient's treatment regimen and replacing it with a different medication.

It binds cyclophilin to form a complex that inhibits calcineurin.

Its primary effect is achieved by stimulating D2-receptors in the substantia nigra and striatum. However, overstimulation of D2-receptors by levodopa may also induce psychosis and hallucinations (usually visual). The risk of developing psychiatric symptoms increases with age, other psychiatric conditions, long duration of levodopa treatment, and high doses. Since this patient has been taking levodopa for 3 years and is elderly, her symptoms are most likely the result of levodopa therapy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. The clinical features of schizophrenia can be categorized according to the positive symptoms of psychosis and the negative symptoms of psychosis. Though this patient has an increased risk (\u223c 12%) of developing schizophrenia because her brother is affected, she lacks other expected symptoms (e.g., disorganized thought process, alogia). Moreover, symptom onset at the patient's age would also be very unusual since it typically is diagnosed in the late 20s in women. Option: C. Major depressive disorder can sometimes be associated with psychotic symptoms. In addition to the features of MDD (SIGECAPS), patients may present with delusions and hallucinations, which are often auditory but can also be visual or tactile. Though this patient has hallucinations and recently noted a lack of motivation, she does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of MDD. Option: D. Poorly controlled hypothyroidism may lead to typical complaints of fatigue, cold intolerance, and weight gain. Especially in elderly patients, hypothyroidism may also present with features similar to dementia, including impaired memory and concentration. Though hallucinations may occur, they are rare and usually accompanied by psychotic symptoms, such as paranoia and thought disorders. This patient lacks any expected signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism and has isolated hallucinations, making thyroid dysfunction unlikely.</p>\n<p></p>",

Corticosteroids are used to treat acute exacerbations of demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Patients with MS usually present with isolated upper motor neuron weakness, in contrast to the mixed upper and lower weakness seen here, and the clinical course of multiple sclerosis is typically characterized by periodic exacerbations and remissions. Option: C. Given the history of partial gastrectomy, this patient is at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency, which may present with neurological deficits such as peripheral neuropathy or subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Peripheral neuropathy from vitamin B12 deficiency would result in paresthesias, and/or sensory loss, while subacute combined degeneration results in a combination of progressive upper motor neuron weakness in the lower limbs and symmetrical loss of vibration and proprioceptive sensations. Decreased muscle tone, muscle atrophy, fasciculations, and asymmetrically absent DTRs would not be an expected finding. Option: D. Nusinersen was approved by the FDA in 2016 to treat spinal muscular atrophy. Patients with spinal muscular atrophy may present with progressive weakness, hypotonia, and fasciculations of the tongue, without any sensory deficits. However, the onset of symptoms typically occurs during infancy and childhood, and patients present only with features of lower motor neuron lesions, in contrast to the mixed upper and lower motor neuron weakness seen in this patient.</p>\n<p></p>",
