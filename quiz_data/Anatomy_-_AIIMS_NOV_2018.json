Inversion: Medial border of the foot is raised so that the sole faces inside. Eversion: Lateral border of the foot is raised so that the sole faces outside.

Inversion: Medial border of the foot is raised so that the sole faces inside. Eversion: Lateral border of the foot is raised so that the sole faces outside. Inversion and eversion occur mainly at intertarsal joints. Major movements occur at the Talo-calcaneo-navicular joint.

Dense regular Connective tissue in tendons and ligaments are examples of dense regular connective tissue. Other examples include the perichondrium around the tracheal cartilage and the tunica albuginea around the testis. Option C. Loose and irregular Loose connective tissue generally works to hold organs, anatomic structures, and tissues in place. The extracellular matrix is the most significant feature of loose connective tissue with large spaces between fibers. Option D. Specialized Specialized connective tissues include adipose, cartilage, bone, blood, and lymphatic tissues. These tissues contribute to diverse functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Basic components of connective tissue</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Oculomotor Nerves emerging out from Cranial foramina Structure passing through the cranial cavity Oculomotor nerve emerges at the midbrain on the medial side of the crus of the cerebral peduncle and passes between the superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries and runs forward in the interpeduncular cistern on the lateral side of the posterior communicating artery to reach cavernous sinus. It enters the cavernous sinus by piercing the posterior part of the roof on the lateral side of the posterior clinoid process and descends along the lateral dural wall of the cavernous sinus, dividing into superior and inferior divisions which run beneath the trochlear and ophthalmic nerve.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The abducens nerve emerges from the brainstem at the junction of the pons and the medulla, [1] superior to the medullary pyramid ] and medial to the facial nerve. It runs upwards and forwards from this position to reach the eye. The nerve enters the subarachnoid space (more precisely, the pontine cistern) when it emerges from the brainstem. It runs upward between the pons and the clivus, and then pierces the dura mater to run between the dura and the skull through Dorello's canal. At the apex of the petrous part of the temporal bone, it makes a sharp turn forward to enter the cavernous sinus. In the cavernous sinus, it runs anterior-ward alongside (inferolateral to) the internal carotid artery. It enters the orbit through (medial end of) the superior orbital fissure, passing through the common tendinous ring to reach and innervate the lateral rectus muscle of the eye.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- The arrow marked nerve is Oculomotor nerves shown in the image above, therefore Option A,B and C are incorrect answers.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The trochlear nerve is unique among the cranial nerves in several respects: It is the smallest nerve in terms of the number of axons it contains. It has the greatest intracranial length. It is the only cranial nerve that exits from the dorsal (rear) aspect of the brainstem. It innervates a muscle, the superior oblique muscle, on the opposite side (contralateral) from its nucleus. The trochlear nerve decussates within the brainstem before emerging on the contralateral side of the brainstem (at the level of the inferior colliculus). An injury to the trochlear nucleus in the brainstem will result in an contralateral superior oblique muscle palsy, whereas an injury to the trochlear nerve (after it has emerged from the brainstem) results in an ipsilateral superior oblique muscle palsy.</p>\n<p></p>",
