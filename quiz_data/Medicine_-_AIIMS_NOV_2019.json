Diagnosis of Wilson\u2019s disease is done by serum ceruloplasmin. In treatment of Wilson\u2019s disease we use chelating agents such as D-penicillamine and Trientine and we also use zinc which is very much effective in blocking copper absorption.</p>\n<p></p>",

The heart rate is regular and is usually 160\u2013220 beats/min but may be greater than 250 beats/min. The P wave usually differs in contour from sinus beats and is often simultaneous with or just after the QRS complex. TREATMENT - In stable patients - we do carotid sinus massage . It is often performed by clinicians but should be avoided if the patient has a carotid bruit. Firm but gentle pressure and massage are applied first over the right carotid sinus for 10\u201320 seconds and, if unsuccessful, then over the left carotid sinus.

The most serious complication is inflammation of the membranes and fluid covering the brain and spinal cord , leading to massive bleeding hemorrhagic and death. The most common pulmonary manifestation of inhalational anthrax (B. anthrax) is hemorrhagic mediastinitis. Diagnosis: Gram staining Test of infected skin/skin sores Blood testing CT scans and Chest X-Ray Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) Endoscopy of the intestine and throat</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Clinical Features:- Cutaneous (skin) anthrax Cutaneous anthrax is typically caused when Bacillus anthracis spores enter through cuts on the skin . This form accounts for over 95% of anthrax cases. Lesions usually occur on exposed skin and often commence with itchiness. They pass through several stages: papular stage vesicular stage with a blister that often becomes hemorrhagic eschar stage that appears two to six days after the hemorrhagic vesicle dries to become a depressed black scab ( malignant pustule ) which may have surrounding redness and extensive edema (swelling). Anthrax lesions are usually painless but pain may result due to surrounding edema. Inhalational (Pulmonary) anthrax also known as Woodsorter's disease results from breathing anthrax spores into the lungs. Earliest symptoms resemble those of a respiratory infection such as mild fever and sore throat. After one to three days of acute phase, increasing fever, dyspnea , stridor , hypoxia , and hypertension occur usually leading to death within 24 hours. Gastrointestinal Anthrax results from ingestion of inadequately-cooked meat from animals with anthrax. symptoms include fever, nausea, and vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and sometimes rapidly developing ascites . After the bacterium invades the bowel system , it spreads through the bloodstream throughout the body , making even more toxins on the way. This form of anthrax is the rarest .</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>High calorie, low volume High volume is not given as the patient is in end stage CKD, patients tend to retain fluid and would lead to over load of fluids, hyperkalemia, hypophosphatemia & accumulation of toxic metabolites. A high calorie feed is preferred as risk of malnutrition and wasting is seen in CKD. To best assess nutritional status, the serum albumin concentration and body weight should be measured serially; these should be measured approximately every one to three months for those with eGFRs <20 mL/min/1.73 m2 Among CKD patients, overnutrition results in sodium and volume overload, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and accumulation of toxic metabolites of protein degradation. Undernutrition, on the other hand, exacerbates the risk for malnutrition and wasting.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Alport's syndrome Alport syndrome is a primary basement membrane disorder arising from mutations in genes encoding several members of the collagen IV protein family, patients with Alport\u2019s syndrome develop hematuria, thinning and splitting of the GBMs, and mild proteinuria (<1\u20132 g/24 h), which appears late in the course, followed by chronic glomerulosclerosis leading to renal failure in association with sensorineural deafness. Some patients develop lenticonus of the anterior lens capsule, \u201cdot and fleck\u201d retinopathy, and rarely, leiomyomatosis. Approximately 85% of patients with Alport\u2019s syndrome have an X-linked inheritance of mutations in the \u03b15(IV) collagen chain on chromosome X. 85% of patients with Alport\u2019s syndrome have an X-linked inheritance of mutations in the \u03b15(IV) collagen chain on chromosome Xq22\u201324. Fifteen percent of patients have autosomal recessive disease of the \u03b13(IV) or \u03b14(IV) chains on chromosome 2q35\u201337. Rarely, some kindred have an autosomal dominant inheritance of dominant-negative mutations in \u03b13(IV) or \u03b14(IV) chains. . All affected members of a family with X-linked Alport\u2019s syndrome should be identified and followed, including mothers of affected males. Primary treatment is control of systemic hypertension and use of ACE inhibitors to slow renal progression.</p>\n<p></p>",
