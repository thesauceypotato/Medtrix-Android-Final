It splits an opaque disc into two halves. It has many uses in ophthalmology. Fincham\u2019s test is used to differentiate that colored halos are due to early cataract or acute congestive glaucoma related corneal decompensation. A stenopaic slit is passed across the pupil and haloes are observed. If those are broken halos, cataract is the most common cause . If brightness is reduced but haloes are intact , cornea is the common cause. Stenopaic slit is useful in finding out the axis of the cylinder. Stenopaic slit is used in cases of corneal opacities to find out the optimal site for optical iridectomy. After dilating the pupil with a mydriatic, the slit is rotated in front of the eye and the axis which gives maximum clarity is chosen for optical iridectomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Histopathology Corneal Tattooing  Shows:- electron dense granules are found within keratocytes and between collagen fibrils.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>CME In the given question there is a history of rheumatoid arthritis in patients. Rheumatoid arthritis is most commonly associated with uveitis . Along with this patient underwent cataract surgery 1 year back followed by sudden painless loss of vision. Postoperative complications:- Diagnosis PCO Elevated lOP CME AU HLA-B27-associated uveitis 4 2 0 JRA 0 0 0 FHIC 2 1 0 Rheumatoid arthritis 0 2 3 Idiopathic uveitis 6 2 4 PU VKH 2 2 2 Behcet\u2019s disease 4 4 1 Total 18/74 13/74 10/74 AU = anterior uveitis, CME = cystoid macular edema, FHIC = Fuchs heterochromic cyclitis, rap = intraocular pressure, JRA = juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, PCO = posterior capsular opacification, PU = panuveitis, VKH = Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. Hence, most probably leakage around macula shown in given image most likely due to CME. Macular hole is a different entity having no association with rheumatoid arthritis and has a different fundal picture. Choroiditis shows healed scars or patches in the retina which have more likely infectious causes. Quinine-induced toxicity particularly shows Bulls eye maculopathy which has a different image as shown below. Image shown in the question is most probably of cystoid macular edema.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Demyelination It is a Cause of horizontal diplopia. Typically, symptoms and examination findings , i.e., diplopia on looking towards the left in the right eye is characteristic of internuclear ophthalmoplegia. INO is the result of damage to the medial longitudinal fasciculus. This is a nerve fiber leading to the brain. The damage may be due to many causes. A stroke can be called ischemia or an ischemic attack. Strokes most commonly affect older people and affect only one eye. In MS, the INO usually affects both eyes.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Anterior INO Eyes are divergent Paralysis of both medial recti Seen in midbrain infarcts, multiple sclerosis Posterior INO There is a painless onset of visual disturbance, No diplopia in primary gaze Medial longitudinal Fasciculus involved the affected eve shows impairment of adduction when both eyes are tested simultaneously The contralateral eye abducts , however, with nystagmus . This is reversed when patient looks to opposite side in bilateral involvement</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Other conditions that can cause INO include: Brainstem encephalitis Behcet\u2019s disease, a rare condition that causes inflammation of the blood vessels Cryptococcosis, a fungal infection associated with AIDS Guillain\u2013Barre syndrome Lyme disease and other tick-borne infections Lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus) Head trauma Brain tumors</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
