AV cushions The gap between the upper edge of the muscular part of the IV septum and the lower end of the bulbar part of IV septum is filled by proliferation of tissue from the right side of the AV cushions and from the right and left bulbar ridges.

Persistent Truncus Arteriosus Persistent truncus arteriosus: In this anomaly spiral septum (aorticopulmonary septum) fails to develop. Pulmonary arteries and aorta arise from a common vessel. Option B. Coarctation of aorta The coarctation means narrowing of the aorta. It occurs due to extension of the process of obliteration of ductus arteriosus (DA) into the aorta. The coarctation of aorta is of two types: preductal and postductal. Preductal type of coarctation of aorta: In this type, a narrow segment of arch of aorta is proximal to the entrance of the DA. The DA persists in this type. Postductal type of coarctation of aorta: In this type, a narrow segment of the arch of aorta is distal to the entrance of the DA. The DA usually obliterates this type. Option D. Transposition of great vessel Transposition of the great vessels occurs when the conotruncal septum fails to follow its normal spiral course and runs straight down. Transposition of great vessels: The aorta arises from the right ventricle, and the pulmonary trunk from the left ventricle. \"</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>If Tetralogy of Fallot is associated with ASD (Atrial septal defect), it is known as Pentalogy of Fallot.

Anatomical closure occurs by the proliferation of tunica intima of DA 1\u20133 months after birth. It is mediated by bradykinin\u2014a substance released from lungs during their initial inflation.</p>\n<p></p>",
