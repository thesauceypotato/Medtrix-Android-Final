It is the most posterior cell of this group and extends along the lamina papyracea, lateral or superior to the sphenoid, and may extend 1.5 cm behind the anterior face of the sphenoid. The optic nerve and sometimes the carotid artery are related to it laterally and are in danger during endoscopic surgery.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Haller cells are a type of ethmoidal cells that are situated on the roof of the maxillary sinus. Sometimes they may enlarge and block the opening of the maxillary sinus leading to maxillary sinusitis. Option: B . Agger nasi is an elevation just anterior to the attachment of middle turbinates. Option: D. Bulla ethmoidalis is the ethmoidal cell situated behind the uncinate process and forms the posterior boundary of hiatus semilunaris through.</p>\n<p></p>",
