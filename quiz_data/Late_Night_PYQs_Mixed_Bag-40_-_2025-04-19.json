Pleomorphic adenomas are the most common benign tumors of the salivary glands, with the parotid gland being the most frequent site. These tumors are encapsulated and exhibit a mixed cellular composition, leading to a variable consistency, which is reflected in their name \"pleomorphic.\" Clinically, they present as painless, slow-growing masses. The characteristic lift of the earlobe due to the swelling is a classic sign of a parotid gland tumor.

These tumors tend to be hard and lack the variable consistency described in the clinical presentation.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Jaw Tumor:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

They are typically congenital and found on the face, neck, or ovary. While they can appear on the face or neck, the described clinical presentation is less suggestive of a dermoid cyst compared to a pleomorphic adenoma. Dermoid cysts often show indentation due to putty material.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Dermoid cyst:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Sebaceous cyst: Also known as an epidermal cyst, a sebaceous cyst is a benign growth arising from blocked sebaceous glands, often containing a thick, cheese-like material. Sebaceous cysts can appear almost anywhere on the body where sebaceous glands are found, including the face, and often show a black punctum.
