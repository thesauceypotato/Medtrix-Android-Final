      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Irregular respiration Uncontrolled increases in ICP result in cerebral herniation. Cerebellar tonsillar herniation through the foramen magnum compresses medullary vasomotor and respiratory centres, classically producing Cushing's Triad- Hypertension, Bradycardia, and Irregular respiration. Herniation of the uncus of the temporal lobe over the tentorium results in pupil abnormalities, usually occurring first on the side of any expanding haematoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Cushing Syndrome : Hypercortisolism may arise as a result of excess ACTH secretion (termed pituitary dependent; Cushing\u2019s disease) Ectopic ACTH secretion from a non-pituitary tumour , exogenous corticosteroid therapy or autonomous secretion of endogenous glucocorticoids from cortical tumours of the adrenal glands (pituitary independent; Cushing\u2019s syndrome) ACTH-secreting pituitary tumours account for 70\u201380% of cases, whereas ectopic ACTH production from foregut neuroendocrine tumours and small cell lung tumours are the cause in 10% Incidence : Both ACTH-dependent and -independent Cushing\u2019s have a strong female preponderance (four to six times), whereas ectopic ACTH syndrome is twice as common in men. The incidence increases significantly from age 50. Clinical features of Cushing's syndrome Clinical feature Incidence (%) Obesity 90 Hypertension 85 Facial plethora 70 Hirsutism 75 Glucose intolerance/diabetes 75 Hyperlipidaemia 70 Abdominal striae 50 Acne 35 Easy bruising 35 Osteoporosis 80 Proximal myopathy 65 Depression/mania/psychosis 85 Menstrual disorders 70 Decrease libido/impotence 85 Renal stones 50 Diagnosis : Biochemical It is important to exclude iatrogenic Cushing\u2019s due to ingested steroid therapy, including potent inhaled corticosteroids. Investigations should then determine if hypercortisolism is present and whether it is ACTH-dependent or independent late-night salivary cortisol (two measurements): raised levels signify a loss of diurnal rhythm; 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) excretion (two measurements): more than three times the upper limit signifies overspill into the urine; overnight 1-mg DST (dexamethasone suppression test): non-suppressed morning cortisol >50 nmol/L; raised serum ACTH signifies pituitary-dependent disease; if it is adrenal in origin, the ACTH is suppressed (<5 pg/mL). Radiological : These tests should determine the causative lesion. The ACTH result will determine which diagnostic pathway is taken ACTH raised : pituitary MRI and inferior petrosal sinus sampling to exclude pituitary microadenoma. If both are negative, this suggests ectopic ACTH syndrome, which warrants CT imaging of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis. Functional imaging with 68Ga-SSTR PET-CT is a useful adjunct and is 75\u201380% sensitive in confirming the source of ectopic ACTH. ACTH suppressed : dedicated adrenal CT or MRI to determine if unilateral adenoma or bilateral nodular hyperplasia (or rarely adrenocortical cancer) are present. Benign lesions are typically hypodense and <10 HU on non-contrast CT Treatment : Medical : Metyrapone or ketoconazole therapy - reduces steroid synthesis and secretion by CYP11B1 inhibition and can be used to prepare patients with severe hypercortisolism Intravenous etomidate infusion (even at non-hypnotic doses) - can reduce serum cortisol levels to normal within 24 hours Surgical : ACTH-producing pituitary tumours are treated by transsphenoidal resection and/or radiotherapy. Resection of ectopic ACTH-secreting tumours will also correct hypercortisolism Patients who have undergone failed pituitary surgery or those with an unresectable or unlocalised ectopic ACTH-secreting tumour may require bilateral adrenalectomy to control hormone excess</p>\n<p></p>",

One person stands at the patient\u2019s head to control the head and c-spine, and two are along the patient\u2019s sides to control the body and extremities. As the patient is rolled, three people maintain alignment of the spine while the fourth person removes the board and examines the back. Once the board is removed, three people return the patient to the supine position while maintaining the alignment of the spine. Per rectum, the examination is also performed during this time only In case 5 people are not available then, a total of 4 persons are mandatory .</p>\n<p></p>",

The rationale is that no aspect of the shock state \u2013  end\u00ad organ perfusion, blood pressure, temperature, lactic acidosis \u2013 can be corrected while patients are bleeding, and repeated cycles of volume resuscitation will exacerbate coagulopathy, hypothermia and metabolic derangements (acidosis, hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia). DCR applies only while patients are bleeding and is based on four key principles Rapid haemorrhage control Permissive hypotension Avoiding dilutional coagulopathy Treating existing coagulation deficits</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The application of these principles to military patients is uncertain because of longer timelines. Prolonged periods of permissive hypotension are likely to be harmful,whereas haemostatic resuscitation and management of ATC is ineffectual in the absence of haemorrhage control.</p>\n<p></p>",
