It usually is because of a small posterior fossa (the skull base may be flat in some cases). The most widely accepted pathophysiological mechanism states that reduction or lack of development of the posterior fossa is the main cause which can be congenital or acquired. Type 1 Chiari malformation is characterized by downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum leading to compression of cerebellar components, the lower brainstem, and the upper cervical spinal cord. In Type 2 Chari malformation, also called classic Chiari malformation, the complete cerebellum and brain stem tissue protrudes into the foramen magnum. It is a more severe type where symptoms appear in early childhood; it is also often accompanied by a myelomeningocele. MRI is the best imaging modality to diagnose this disorder.</p>\n<p></p>",

Traditionally, obstruction to the CSF flow within the ventricular system has been associated with obstructive or non-communicating hydrocephalus while impairment of circulation through the subarachnoid space (for example due to obliteration of subarachnoid cisterns) or defective absorption in the venous system has been associated with non-obstructive or communicating hydrocephalus. The aqueduct is the most common site of intraventricular blockade of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) flow ; with causes of obstruction being congenital or acquired. Congenital aqueductal stenosis is one of the most common causes of obstructive hydrocephalus in children. Infections such as mumps and toxoplasmosis are acquired causes of aqueductal stenosis in children and can also lead to obstructive hydrocephalus. Diagnosis should be made by measurement of head circumference (particularly in infants), USG (mainly when the AF is open), CT and MRI. Although CT can demonstrate ventricular dilatation, it may further be required to identify the nature of the obstruction, either functionally or anatomically. MRI is the best imaging modality to provide such functional and anatomic information.
