Lobar pneumonia is most commonly caused by extracellular bacterial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Options a, d) . In this case, the cell-mediated immune response components primarily controlled the infection. This suggests that the pneumonia was likely due to an intracellular pathogen such as Legionella pneumophila (a common cause of atypical community-acquired pneumonia).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>pathogenesis- legionella pneumonia The immune response to extracellular organisms is primarily mediated by neutrophils early in infection and by the humoral antibody response (B lymphocytes, immunoglobulins, complement) as time goes on. Macrophages phagocytose intracellular pathogens but are initially resistant to destruction due to the presence of virulence factors that inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion (e.g., Legionella) or phagolysosome acidification (e.g., Mycobacteria tuberculosis), or allow bacteria to escape from the phagolysosome (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes). L egionella and other intracellular pathogens that initially replicate within the phagosome eventually undergo some degree of digestion by lysosomes, leading to the display of bacterial antigens on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. This stimulates naive CD4 T lymphocytes to differentiate into T-helper subtype 1 (Th1) cells. Th1 cells release interferon-gamma, which activates macrophages and allows them to form fully mature (acidified) phagolysosomes capable of efficiently killing the intracellular.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option C.

Unlike most bacteria, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia do not have cell walls composed of peptidoglycan. Mycoplasma completely lacks a cell wall, while Chlamydia has a cell wall composed of an alternate protein. Therefore, these pathogens cannot be seen on Gram stain (which stains peptidoglycan) and cannot be treated with antibacterial agents that target peptidoglycans, such as penicillins, cephalosporins, vancomycin, or carbapenems.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae bacteria commonly cause mild infections of the respiratory system. Lung infections caused by pneumoniae are sometimes called \u201cwalking pneumonia\u201d since symptoms are generally mild. M. pneumoniae is a significant cause of acute respiratory tract infection, especially as a potential etiology of the clinical entity termed \"atypical pneumonia\". Initially, it was known as the Eaton agent. pneumoniae can affect the upper or lower respiratory tracts or both. Symptoms commonly appear gradually, during a few days, and can persist for weeks or months. Typical clinical features include initial pharyngitis, sore throat, hoarseness, and fever. An intractable day and night cough characterise the extension of the infection to the lower airways. Initially, cough is non-productive but later may yield small to moderate amounts of non-bloody sputum. Dyspnoea may be evident in more severe cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Bacterial causes of atypical pneumonia: Mycoplasma Chlamydia pneumonia Legionella With a history of animal/ zoonotic contact: Psittacosis Q fever Tularemia</p>\n<p></p>",

Most respiratory tularemia shows peribronchial infiltration in the early stages, progressing to multilobar bronchopneumonia infiltration and pleural effusion.
