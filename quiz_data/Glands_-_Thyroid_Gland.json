After branching from the vagus nerve [X] and looping around the subclavian artery on the right and the arch of the aorta on the left, the recurrent laryngeal nerves ascend in a groove between the trachea and esophagus.

The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates the majority of the vocal muscles that open and close the rima glottidis, in addition to providing sensory supply to the larynx below the vocal folds.

It first runs upwards along the medial border of the scalenus anterior and then passes medially behind the carotid sheath to reach the back of the thyroid lobe, where it is intimately related to the recurrent laryngeal nerve . The recurrent laryngeal nerve presents a variable relationship with the artery. It may pass behind or in front of the loop of the artery or between the branches of the artery.

The posterior branch descends along the posterior border of the lobe to anastomose with the ascending branch of the inferior thyroid artery.
