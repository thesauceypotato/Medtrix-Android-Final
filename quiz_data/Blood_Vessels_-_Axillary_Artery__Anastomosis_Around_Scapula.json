      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Axillary Vein The cephalic vein pierces the clavipectoral fascia and joins the axillary vein. Cephalic Vein Option: Axillary vein- The cephalic vein, along with the basilic vein, is one of the primary superficial veins that drain the upper limb. It courses through both the forearm and arm and terminates by draining into the axillary vein.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Brachial veins are venae comitantes of the brachial artery in the arm proper. Because they are deep in the muscle, they are considered deep veins. Their course is that of the brachial artery (in reverse): they begin where radial veins and ulnar veins join (corresponding to the bifurcation of the brachial artery). They end at the inferior border of the teres major muscle. At this point, the brachial veins join the basilic vein to form the axillary vein. Option: B. Each subclavian vein is a continuation of the axillary vein and runs from the outer border of the first rib to the medial border of the anterior scalene muscle. From here it joins with the internal jugular vein to form the brachiocephalic vein (also known as \"innominate vein\"). Option: D. IVC- The IVC is a large blood vessel responsible for transporting deoxygenated blood from the lower extremities and abdomen back to the right atrium of the heart.</p>\n<p></p>",
