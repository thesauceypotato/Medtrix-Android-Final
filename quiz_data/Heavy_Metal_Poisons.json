Aluminium phosphide (ALP) is a solid fumigant pesticide, insecticide and rodenticide. Has the capacity to liberate one gram of phosphine (PH3). On coming in contact with moisture ALP liberates phosphine. Phosphine is a systemic poison and affects all organs of the body. Phosphine inhibits respiratory chain enzymes and has cytotoxic action. It acts by inhibiting the electron transport resulting from preferential inhibition of cytochrome oxidase. Metabolic acidosis should be corrected with i.v. sodium carbonate. Peritoneal or hemodialysis is useful.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Fine tremor Chronic mercury poisoning are:- Chronic exposure to elemental mercury yields a classic triad of gingivitis and salivation, tremors and neuropsychiatric changes. The symptoms are salivation, inflammation of gums and occasionally a blue line at their junction with teeth, sore mouth and throat, loosening of teeth, gastrointestinal disturbances, anaemia, anorexia, loss of weight and chronic inflammation of kidneys with progressive uraemia. Tremors (sometimes called Danbury tremors) occur first in the hands, then progress to the lips and tongue and finally involve arms and legs. The tremor is moderately coarse and is interspersed by jerky movements. The advanced condition is called hatter's shakes or glass-blowers shakes because they are common in persons working in glass-blowing and hat industries. The patient then becomes unable to dress. Write legibly or walk properly. The most severe form is known as concussion Mercurialis, in which no activity is possible. Mercurial erethism is seen in persons working with mercury in minor manufacturing firms. This term is used to refer to the psychological effects of mercury toxicity. These include anxiety, depression, shyness, timidity, irritability, loss of confidence, mental depression, delusions and hallucinations, suicidal melancholia, manic-depressive psychosis (mad hatter), emotional instability, loss of memory and insomnia. Mercurialentis is a peculiar eye change due to exposure to the vapour of mercury. It is due to a brownish deposit of mercury through the cornea on the anterior lens capsule. Slit-lamp examination demonstrates a malt-brown reflex from the anterior lens capsule. It is bilateral and has no effect on visual acuity. Renal damage results in membranous glomerulonephritis with hyaline casts and fatty casts in the urine. The kidney is the primary target.</p>\n<p></p>",
