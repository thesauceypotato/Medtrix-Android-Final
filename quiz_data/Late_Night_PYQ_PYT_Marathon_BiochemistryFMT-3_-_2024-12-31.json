      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. A) Tertiary structure is three dimensional</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The tertiary structure of proteins refers to the overall three-dimensional arrangement of a polypeptide chain, shaped by various interactions including hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and van der Waals forces. This structure is crucial for the protein's functional specificity, allowing the precise positioning of amino acid side chains necessary for biological activity. The three-dimensional nature of tertiary structure is essential for the functionality of enzymes and other proteins in biological systems.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Primary, secondary, and tertiary structures are destroyed by denaturation: Denaturation typically affects secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, but the primary structure, which is the sequence of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, remains intact. Therefore, this statement is partially correct but not entirely.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Primary, secondary, and tertiary structures are destroyed by denaturation:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Secondary structure is stabilized by disulphide bonds: Disulphide bonds primarily stabilize tertiary and sometimes quaternary structures by forming covalent links between different parts of the protein or between different protein subunits. Secondary structures like alpha-helices and beta-sheets are primarily stabilized by hydrogen bonds.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Secondary structure is stabilized by disulphide bonds:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Secondary and Tertiary structure depends upon amino acid sequence: While this statement holds truth in that the primary sequence does dictate the secondary and tertiary structures due to the chemical properties of the amino acids involved, it's not the complete answer regarding the \"true\" statement sought by the question.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Secondary structure is the formed by folding of primary structure by hydrogen bonding between various residues. Example alpha helix, beta-pleated sheets, loops, and bends Tertiary structure denotes the overall 3D arrangement formed by interactions of the various regions, or domains of a single polypeptide chain. The tertiary structure is maintained by noncovalent interactions between amino acid residue such as hydrophobic bonds, electrostatic bonds and van der Waals forces. Quaternary structure results when the proteins consist of two or more polypeptide chains held together by noncovalent forces like hydrogen bonds, electrostatic bonds, hydrophobic bonds and van der Waals forces.</li><li>\u27a4 Primary structure of protein means the order of amino acids in the polypeptide chain and the location of disulfide bonds, if any.</li><li>\u27a4 Primary structure</li><li>\u27a4 Secondary structure is the formed by folding of primary structure by hydrogen bonding between various residues.

This blockade of acetylcholine release results in muscle paralysis, making botulinum toxin useful for medical and cosmetic purposes to treat conditions characterized by excessive muscle activity.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>\u21b3 Reference : Harper\u2019s 31 st ed/pg- 587</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

The accompanying symptoms of easy bruising and bleeding gums are classic signs of Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy). Vitamin C deficiency can lead to weakened blood vessels and increased capillary fragility, causing easy bruising. Additionally, scurvy can cause gum inflammation and bleeding. The combination of GERD-induced laryngospasm and scurvy symptoms points to Vitamin C deficiency as the underlying cause.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Vitamin D : While Vitamin D deficiency can cause laryngospasm through hypocalcemia, it doesn't explain the bruising and bleeding symptoms.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Vitamin D</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Vitamin E : Vitamin E deficiency primarily causes neurological symptoms and muscle weakness but doesn't typically cause laryngospasm or bleeding symptoms.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

The patient's vitals are stable, but the signs of envenomation are present. In all cases of envenomation, the main life-treating measure is administering antisnake venom (ASV). Polyvalent ASV 5000 units should be given as the first step in management whenever poisonous features, such as bleeding, are present.</li><li>\u2022 viper snake bite</li><li>\u2022 In all cases of envenomation, the main life-treating measure is administering antisnake venom</li><li>\u2022 5000 units</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option.
