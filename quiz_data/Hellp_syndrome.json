      "text": "A 32-Year-old woman is 34 weeks pregnant and comes to the emergency department because she cannot walk, secondary to swelling in her legs. Physical examination shows a temperature of 36.5\u00b0 C (97.7\u00b0 F), a pulse of 95/min, and a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg. The patient complains of a severe headache but has no other symptoms. Which of the following tests would help most in the initial diagnosis of this patient?",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>24-hour urine collection In the given case, the female presents increased bp , swelling in her legs and severe headache, which point towards preeclampsia . Preeclampsia Rise in B/P seen after 20 weeks pregnancy. meoc Proteinuria (>300 mg in 24-hour urine collection or >30 mg/dl in a random urine sample or > + 1 on.) + B/P comes back to normal within 12 weeks of delivery The next step will be to determine proteinuria . So among the given options to confirm proteinuria, the best test will be 24-hour urine collection.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. An electroencephalogram looks at electrical brain activity and is especially useful for looking at waveforms during a seizure. Eclampsia is essentially the symptoms and signs of preeclampsia with seizures. Preeclampsia by definition does not involve seizures, and thus an electroencephalogram would not help in a definitive initial diagnosis. Option: C. Elevated liver enzymes are associated with the HELLP syndrome ( H emolysis, E levated L iver function tests, and L ow P latelets). A liver panel would reveal any elevated liver enzymes. Preeclampsia may or may not involve elevated liver enzymes, and thus a panel would not help in a definitive initial diagnosis. Option: D A Pap smear allows a physician to identify dysplastic cervical koilocytes by scraping off cells from the cervix and mounting them onto a slide to be viewed under a microscope. This is useful in diagnosing disordered epithelial growth that is possibly associated with cervical carcinoma. Preeclampsia does not involve dysplastic cervical cells, and thus a Pap smear would not help in a definitive initial diagnosis.</p>\n<p></p>",
