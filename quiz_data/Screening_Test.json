This is a variation between repeated observations by the same observer on the same subject or material simultaneously. Intra-observer variation may often be minimized by simultaneously taking the average of several replicate measurements.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A: This is variation between different observers on the same subject or material, also known as between-observer variation. Inter-observer variation occurs if one observer examines a blood smear and finds a malaria parasite while a second observer examines the same slide and finds it normal. Here, the resident found ECG normal, whereas when the consultant saw ECG, he did not find it normal; it is mainly due to lacking experience. Observational errors are common in the interpretation of X-rays, ECG tracings, readings of blood pressure, and studies of histopathological specimens Option C: repeatability may be affected by variations inherent in the method, e.g. defective instruments, erroneous calibration, faulty reagents; or the test itself might be inappropriate or unreliable. Where these errors are large, repeatability will be reduced, and a single test result may be unreliable. Option D: There is a biological variability associated with many physiological variables such as blood pressure, blood sugar, serum cholesterol, etc. The fluctuation in the vanity measured in the same individual may be due to: Changes in the parameters observed Variations in the way patients perceive their symptoms and answer.

They are fixed parameters, i.e., the sensitivity & specificity of any test will not change in different types of settings. In other words, they are an intrinsic property of a screening test. The Predictive value of a screening test is largely dependent on the prevalence of the disease in the population in which the diagnostic test is being applied. As a general rule, the higher the prevalence of disease in the population, the higher will be the PPV. It, therefore, follows that it is best to apply a screening test in a population that has a high prevalence of disease because the PPV will be high and hence we will get a high yield. In general, the Sensitivity of a screening test is inversely proportional to the Specificity of the tes t. If sensitivity increases, then specificity decreases and vice-versa. Sensitivity of a screening test is the ability to identify correctly all those who are positives, i.e., true positives. Hence, sensitivity is directly proportional to True Positives.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Screening time bias Following biases are possible in screening programs- Lead Time Bias: If the early detection does not affect the course of the disease, then it will be like giving the patient a few more years of sickness and apprehension rather than health. This is called Lead Time Bias Length Time Bias: It has been observed that cases detected through a screening test tend to have a longer preclinical stage than those missed out by screening. This preclinical stage is defined as the interval between the time a screening test can detect a disease and the time the patient seeks care due to experiencing symptoms. Thus, length of time is a bias that tends to spuriously show better survival among screen-detected cases. Self-selection bias: If the group offered screening and others not offered screening are not constituted by random allocation but rather based on self-selection, such volunteers may be more health conscious, educated, and more likely to give up associated risk factors; hence survival in such a screened group is likely to be better, not due to screening, but because of associated factors. Berkesonian bias: is a type of bias that arises because of the different rates of admission to hospitals for people with different diseases, especially in case-control studies (i.e., hospital cases and controls).</p>\n<p></p>",

They are useful for comparing the diagnostic ability of two or more screening tests or assessing the predictive ability of two or more biomarkers for the same disease. The different curve points correspond to the cutpoints used to determine whether the test results are positive or negative. The curve is obtained by joining the points represented by sensitivity and 1-specificity for the different cutpoints and the chance diagonal represented by the 45-degree line drawn through the coordinates (0,0) and (1,1). Generally, the test with the higher area under the curve may be considered better.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Berkesonian bias Berkesonian bias arises because of the different rates of admission to hospitals for people with different diseases, especially in case-control studies (i.e., hospital cases and controls). If early detection does not affect the course of the disease, it will be like giving the patient a little richness and apprehension rather than health. This is called Lead Time Bias and is exactly what has been depicted in this question. It has been observed that cases detected through a screening test tend to have a longer preclinical stage than those missed out by screening. This preclinical stage is defined as the interval between the time a screening test can detect a disease and the time the patient seeks care due to experiencing symptoms. Thus, length of time is a bias that tends to spuriously show better survival among screen-detected cases. Self-selection bias- If the group offered screening and others not offered to screen is not constituted by random allocation but rather based on self-selection, such volunteers may be more health conscious, educated, and more likely to give up associated risk factors; hence survival in such a screened group is likely to be better, not due to screening, but because of associated factors.</p>\n<p></p>",
