Rifampin is well absorbed after oral administration and excreted mainly through the liver into bile. It then undergoes enterohepatic recirculation, with the bulk excreted as a deacylated metabolite in feces and a small amount in the urine. Rifampin is distributed widely in body fluids and tissues.</p>\n<p></p>",

Hypercalcemia enhances digitalis-induced inotropy leading to possible Ca 2 overload and increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced arrhythmias. Hypomagnesemia can sensitize the heart to digitalis-induced arrhythmias. Hack JB. Chapter 84. Cardoactive eroids in Hack JB, ed. Goldfank's Toxicologic Emergencies ed. New York McGraw-2011 The elimination half-life of digoxin ordinarily is about 40 h( around 2 days) So the drug will take four to five half-lives( around 8 to 10 days) to attain a steady state concentration and provide therapeutic efficacy In case of life-threatening atrial fibrillation, we need immediate effect Hence we need to give a loading dose to provide an immediate effect. This is called digitalization</p>\n<p></p>",
