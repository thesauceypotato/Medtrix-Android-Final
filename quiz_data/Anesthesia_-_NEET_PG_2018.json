      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Inj. atropine Squint surgery is done under general anesthesia. During GA excessive vagal activity, which causes severe bradycardia and hypotension can be life-threatening. The trigger can be painful stimulation of the bronchial, pharyngeal, laryngeal or esophageal mucosa. Prompt treatment is needed with urgent restoration of venous return by leg elevation, head down tilt and IV fluids, and the use of anticholinergic and sympathomimetic drugs. A pacemaker should be considered for patients with vasovagal syncope which is frequent and does not respond to medical treatment. The use of a temporary pacemaker for patients who develop bradycardia during general anesthesia is controversial. Profound bradycardia during eye surgery is a potentially serious event. In clinical practice this oculocardiac reflex (OCR) is most often encountered during squint surgery. Atropine premedication in the patients of squint surgery under general anesthesia definitely obtunds OCR and prevents any untoward effects of dysrhythmias during eye surgery.</p>\n<p></p>",

Facial nerve stimulation of orbicularis oculi is also very commonly used. Neuromuscular monitoring , also known as train of four monitoring is a technique used during recovery from the application of general anesthesia to objectively determine how well a patient's muscles are able to function. It involves the application of electrical stimulation to nerves and recording of muscle response using, for example, an acceleromyograph. The diaphragm, rectus abdominis, laryngeal adductors and orbicularis oculi muscles recover from neuromuscular block- age earlier than adductor pollicis.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Endotracheal tubes Endotracheal tubes are used to establish and maintain airway patency, prevent aspiration into the lungs, i.e. 'secure' the air- way, and allow mechanical ventilation. Most endotracheal tubes today are constructed of polyvinyl chloride, but specialty tubes constructed of silicone rubber, latex rubber, or stainless steel are also widely available. Most tubes have an inflatable cuff to seal the trachea and bronchial tree against air leakage and aspiration of gastric contents, blood, secretions, and other fluids. Uncuffed tubes are also available, though their use is limited mostly to pediatric patients (in small children, the cricoid cartilage, the narrowest portion of the pediatric airway, often provides an adequate seal for mechanical ventilation). Tubes larger than 6 mm ID usually have an inflatable cuff. Originally made from red rubber, most modern tubes are made from polyvinyl chloride. Those placed in a laser field may be flexometallic. Double-lumen endobronchial tubes for thoracic surgery allow single-lung ventilation while the other lung is collapsed to make surgery easier. Another type of endotracheal tube has a small second lumen opening above the inflatable cuff which can be used for suction of the nasopharyngeal area and above the cuff to aid extubation (removal). This allows suctioning of secretions which sit above the cuff which helps reduce the risk of chest infections in long-term intubated patients. Its different parts are:</p>\n<p></p>",
