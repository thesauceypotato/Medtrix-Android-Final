Bronchioles open into short pieces called terminal bronchioles, which are thin-walled branches of the bronchioles. Terminal bronchioles transition into respiratory bronchioles. Option D. Respiratory bronchioles The respiratory bronchioles are the narrowest airways of the lungs, 0.5 mm across. The respiratory bronchioles deliver air to the exchange surfaces of the lungs. They are interrupted by alveoli which are thin-walled evaginations. Alveolar ducts are sided branches of the respiratory bronchioles.

Diseases of the bronchioles include asthma, bronchiolitis obliterans, respiratory syncytial virus infections, and influenza. The medical condition of inflammation of the bronchioles is termed bronchiolitis .</p>\n<p></p>",
