The pituitary hormone which is regulated with inhibiting hormones are TSH PRL GH Now inhibited through tuberoinfundibular pathway = prl ( prolactin) The important line here is = Hormones inhibit gonadotropin-releasing hormone - that must be via negative feedback And inhibit gonadal steroids - so estrogen and testosterone are reduced. So either FSH or LH is increased = decreased GnRH . But then estrogen testosterone should be elevated. Or prolactin is increased which can inhibit GnRH and therefore gonadal steroids. so this problem question points towards prolactin.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- So, Options A, B and C are not the correct choices.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Prl levels increase markedly (about tenfold) during pregnancy and decline rapidly within 2 weeks of parturition.

The pars tuberalis is a distinct subdivision of the pituitary gland but its function remains poorlyunderstood. Suprasellar tumors in this pars tuberalis region are frequently accompanied by hyperprolactinemia. It has been postulated conventionally that these suprasellar tumors induce hyperprolactinemia by compressing the pituitary stalk, resulting in impaired dopamine delivery to the pituitary and, consequently, disinhibition of the lactotropes An alternative hypothesis proposed is that suprasellar tumors secrete a specific pars tuberalis factor that stimulates prolactin secretion.
