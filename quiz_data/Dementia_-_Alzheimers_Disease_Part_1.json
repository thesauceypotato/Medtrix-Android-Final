Consequently, left hemisphere lesions do not give rise to much contralesional neglect because the global attentional mechanisms of the right hemisphere can compensate f or the loss of the contralaterally directed attentional functions of the left hemisphere. Right hemisphere lesions , however, give rise to severe contralesional left hemispatial neglect because the unaffected left hemisphere does not contain ipsilateral attentional mechanisms. This model is consistent with clinical experience, which shows that contralesional neglect is more common, more severe, and longer lasting after damage to the right hemisphere than after damage to the left hemisphere.
