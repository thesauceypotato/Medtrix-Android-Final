Creatinine Clearance is Lesser than Inulin Clearance: Creatinine clearance is often slightly higher than inulin clearance. While inulin is exclusively filtered at the glomerulus and not reabsorbed or secreted, creatinine, although primarily filtered, is also slightly secreted by the renal tubules. This secretion leads to a slightly higher clearance rate compared to inulin.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Creatinine Clearance is Lesser than Inulin Clearance:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Creatinine Clearance is Equal to Inulin Clearance: Although creatinine clearance is frequently used as a practical estimate of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), it is not exactly equal to inulin clearance. Inulin clearance is a more accurate measure of GFR as it is neither reabsorbed nor secreted, whereas creatinine is slightly secreted.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Creatinine is a waste product of muscle metabolism, while inulin is a plant-derived polysaccharide that is not normally produced by the human body.</li><li>\u27a4 Creatinine clearance is a measure of the rate at which creatinine is cleared from the blood by the kidneys, while inulin clearance is a measure of the rate at which inulin is cleared from the blood by the kidneys. In theory, the clearance rates of these two substances should be equal, as they are both freely filtered by the glomerulus (the filtering unit of the kidney) and are not reabsorbed or secreted by the tubules but in practice, creatinine clearance is generally slightly higher due to the tubular secretion of creatinine and the possibility of incomplete urine collection during the clearance test.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Harper\u2019s Illustrated Biochemistry 32nd edition Page no. 574</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Harper\u2019s Illustrated Biochemistry 32nd edition Page no. 574</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
