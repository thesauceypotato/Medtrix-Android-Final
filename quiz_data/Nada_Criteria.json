      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Diastolic murmur of grade 2 Cyanosis over nails is peripheral cyanosis. Peripheral cyanosis does not imply the presence of heart disease. Peripheral cyanosis results from increased oxygen extraction of blood from the tissues and is seen in fingers and toes but not in mucous membranes. A diastolic murmur always indicates the presence of organic heart disease.
