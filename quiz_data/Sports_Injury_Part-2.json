The foot is rotated externally. Now the examiner palpates the posteromedial margin of the joint with one hand and by other the foot if firmly grasped. Now the knee is slowly extended. As the femur passes over the torn part of the meniscus a click may be heard. The angle of flexion at which the symptoms occurs indicates the position of the tear. The more posterior is the tear, the more flexed position of the knee is when the sign becomes positive. For lateral meniscus similar test with the foot internally rotated and examiner's hand palpating the posterolateral aspect of knee is carried out.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B.
