High tracheostomy It is done above the level of thyroid isthmus (isthmus lies against II, III and IV tracheal rings). It violates the first ring of the trachea. Tracheostomy at this site can cause perichondritis of the cricoid cartilage and subglot- tic stenosis and is always avoided. The only indication for high tracheostomy is carcinoma of the larynx because, in such cases, the entire larynx would ultimately be removed and a fresh tracheostome made in a clean area lower down. Mid tracheostomy It is the preferred one and is done through the II or III ring and would entail the division of the thyroid isthmus or its retraction upwards or downwards to expose this part of the trachea. Low tracheostomy It is done below the level of the isthmus. Trachea is deep at this level and close to several large vessels; also, there are difficulties with the tracheostomy tube, which impinges on the suprasternal notch. Skin incisions in tracheostomy. (A) Vertical midline incision. (B) Transverse incision.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Indications For Tracheostomy 1.

Glottis is the most common site of cancer. There are few lymphatics in vocal cords, and nodal metastases are practically never seen in cordal lesions unless the disease spreads beyond the region of the membranous cord. Hoarseness of voice is an early sign because lesions of the cord affect its vibratory capacity. It is because of this that glottic cancer is detected early. However, if the tumour invades the supra or the infraglottic spaces, lymph node spread can occur. Cancer of the larynx. (A) Supraglottic, (B) glottic and (C) subglottic.</p>\n<p></p>",
