A) Lysine</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Lysine is a hydrophilic (polar) amino acid with a positively charged side chain. In an aqueous environment like plasma, polar and charged amino acids, such as lysine, preferentially locate on the surface of globular proteins. This positioning allows them to interact with the surrounding water molecules through hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions, stabilizing the protein's structure. Conversely, hydrophobic (nonpolar) amino acids tend to be buried in the interior of the protein to avoid contact with water.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.
