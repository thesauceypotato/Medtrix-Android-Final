      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Superior Rectal vein The patient's findings of anorectal varices and past medical history of cirrhosis and upper GI bleeding suggest portal hypertension. Anorectal varices occur in patients with portal hypertension due to increased blood flow in the portosystemic anastomoses that connect the superior rectal vein with the inferior and middle rectal veins. The superior rectal vein receives blood from the region of the anal canal above the dentate line and drains into the inferior mesenteric vein (portal venous circulation). The superior rectal vein would be the source of bleeding in the case of lesions located above the dentate line , such as the anorectal varices seen in this patient. The inferior rectal veins, which receive blood from the region below the dentate line and drain into the internal pudendal veins (systemic venous circulation), would be the source of bleeding in the case of lesions below the dentate line, such as external hemorrhoids.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Four degrees of haemorrhoids First degree \u2013 bleed only, no prolapse Second-degree \u2013 prolapse but reduced spontaneously Third degree \u2013 prolapse but have to be manually reduced Fourth degree \u2013 permanently prolapsed</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B - Blood from the region of the anal canal below the pectinate line drains into the internal pudendal veins via its tributary.

External hemorrhoids manifest with a painful rectal bleeding drain into the internal pudendal veins. Option C- The inferior mesenteric artery does supply blood to the region of the anal canal above the dentate line via its branch, the superior rectal artery. However, this patient's bleeding source is an enlarged tortuous vein (varix), not an artery. Option. D- The inferior rectal veins receive blood from the region of the anal canal below the dentate line . The anorectal varices in this patient are located above the dentate line, so a different vessel is the more likely source of bleeding.

Anal cancer typically presents as an exophytic, hard anal mass often tender and bleeds easily.

B - Abdominoperineal resection (APR) is indicated in certain patients with low-lying rectal adenocarcinomas that cannot be treated with sphincter-sparing procedures and those with adenocarcinomas of the anal canal. However, adenocarcinomas of the anal canal are rare and not the most likely diagnosis in a young patient without a family history of colorectal cancer or other predisposing factors like inflammatory bowel disease, smoking, or alcohol consumption. Option. C - Local cytostatic treatment with 5-fluorouracil is indicated in patients with anogenital warts (i.e., condylomata acuminata ). Although anogenital warts may manifest as painful lesions, like those seen in this patient, they usually present as cauliflower-like lumps, not a hard mass, and rectal bleeding is a rare sequelae. Option. D - Total mesorectal excision is usually performed with low anterior resection in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma . However, the patient's tumor is just above the anal verge, within the anal canal, rather than the rectum. In addition, adenocarcinoma is unlikely in a young patient without predisposing factors such as a family history of colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, smoking, or alcohol consumption.</p>\n<p></p>",

The etiology is usually benign and primary, with the most common cause being local trauma (e.g., passing of hard stools due to constipation), persistent diarrhoea, vaginal delivery, or anal sex.

At the outset, she is advised conservative management \u2013 normalising bowel habits, stool-softening agents and minimising straining.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>According to modern theories, hemorrhoids are considered normal anatomical structures. These structures consist of cushions of submucosal tissue containing venules, arterioles, smooth muscle fibres, and elastic connective tissue, also known as VASE. The anal canal has three hemorrhoidal cushions in the left lateral, right anterior, and right posterior positions at 3, 7, and 11 o'clock, respectively. Hemorrhoids, also known as piles, are anal cushions that can become symptomatic, causing discomfort and pain Hemorrhoids are more likely to occur when there is an increase in intra-abdominal pressure, which can be caused by factors such as obesity, constipation, and pregnancy. Typical symptoms of hemorrhoids include bright-red, painless bleeding, mucus discharge, and prolapse. Although it's difficult to palpate hemorrhoids, they can be diagnosed more accurately through proctoscopy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A: Anal fissure - severe anal pain bleeding associated with defecation. Anteromedial fissure occurs during vaginal delivery bit fissure is a very painful condition, in this patient, there is painless per rectal bleed Option B: Anal fistula - patient usually complains of intermittent purulent discharge. Also on examination, an opening is seen close to the anal verge. Option D: Pruritis ani - intractable itching around anus</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The mere presence of hemorrhoids does not necessarily require treatment; only symptomatic hemorrhoids should be treated. Treatment for hemorrhoids should be as minimally invasive as possible while effectively alleviating symptoms.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Rectal prolapse The patient has Rectal prolapse . Full-thickness rectal prolapse (complete prolapse) is six times more common in women. The complications are bleeding , incarceration and small-bowel evisceration . The management consist of a colonoscopy or a flexible sigmoidoscopy to exclude any mucosal lesions. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment, the options being abdominal or perineal approach, the former being open or laparoscopic.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Rectal prolapse is a medical condition where the rectum protrudes through the anus approximately 1-4cm. The condition may present in two forms, mucosal or full thickness. In the latter, the whole rectal wall is involved. The condition may start as an internal rectal prolapse or rectal intussusception. In children, the prolapse is commonly mucosal and can be treated non-invasively. However, in adults, the prolapse is often full-thickness and associated with symptoms of constipation and incontinence. A. Full-thickness rectal prolapse and B. Mucosal prolapse</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A : Villous adenomas are usually very large with a typical frond-like appearance often occupying the entire rectum. These might present with profuse watery, mucoid diarrhoea, making the patient very weak because of the loss of large amounts of potassium. They have a propensity to malignant change, something that can be strongly suspected on digital examination. Option B: Patients with rectal carcinoma typically complain of \u2018early-morning spurious diarrhoea\u2019.The patient typically complains of having to wake up in the morning earlier than usual because of an intense desire to defecate only to rush to the lavatory to pass \u2018wind and water\u2019, which the patient refers to as \u2018diarrhoea\u2019; this is \u2018spurious\u2019 because it is false as there are no faeces but just pent-up mucus secretion proximal to an obstruction. The patient has to make several such trips, being left with a constant desire to defecate \u2013 a symptom called tenesmus . Option D : Solitary rectal ulcer Also called solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS),is often associated with other pelvic floor disorders. Despite the name, sometimes there might be no ulcer, while there might be multiple ulcers or erosions. Typically there is an ulcer in the anterior rectal wall when a carcinoma or inflammatory bowel disease must be excluded. It might heal by itself, leaving a polypoid-looking lesion. Management of SRUS is STARR procedure{Stapled Transanal Rectal Resection of Intussusception}</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Surgery is usually required to correct full-thickness rectal prolapse. The procedure may be performed through the perineum or the abdomen.</p>\n<p></p>",
