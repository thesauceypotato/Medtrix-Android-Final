      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Laryngocele The image shows a cavity continuous with the airways suggesting  a Laryngocele.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>LARYNGOCELE A laryngocele is a rare abnormal sac-like structure that forms in the larynx (dilatation of the saccule of the laryngeal ventricle) . An air-filled cyst that develops due to an outpouching of the lining of the larynx or an abnormal dilatation of the laryngeal ventricle, which is a small space within the larynx. Laryngoceles are usually acquired rather than congenital. They are lined by pseudostratified, columnar, ciliated epithelium Risk factors : Raised intralaryngeal pressure secondary to Excessive cough Playing woodwind/brass instruments Glass blowing Obstructing lesion, e.g. a tumor Laryngoceles can be categorized into two types based on their location - internal and external laryngoceles. Internal laryngoceles occur within the larynx External laryngoceles occur outside of the larynx and protrude into the neck. Laryngocele left side as seen on Valsalva (arrow)..</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A- Laryngeal cyst  arises in the aryepiglottic fold and appears as bluish, fluid-filled smooth swelling in the supraglottic larynx. Respiratory obstruction may necessitate tracheostomy. Needle aspiration or incision and drainage of cyst provide an emergency airway. Treatment is deroofing the cyst or excision with CO2 laser OPTION B- Thyroglossal cyst presents as a cystic midline swelling, usually affecting young children but can occur at any age . It is usually rounded with a diameter of 2\u20134 cm. It increases in size with upper respiratory tract infection. OPTION D- Branchial cyst is common in the second decade of life but can occur at any age with equal frequency in both sexes. Cyst presents as a swelling in the upper part of the neck anterior to sternocleidomastoid muscle. Mass is smooth, round, fluctuant, nontender and nontransilluminant. A painful increase in size at the time of upper respiratory infection can occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The treatment of laryngocele depends on the size and location of the cyst and the presence of any symptoms. If the laryngocele is small and asymptomatic, no treatment may be necessary, and it can be monitored periodically. However, if the laryngocele is causing symptoms, surgical excision may be required.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus Killian's dehiscence (also known as Killian's triangle) is a triangular area in the wall of the pharynx between the cricopharyngeus and thyropharyngeus which are the two parts of the inferior constrictors. It represents a potentially weak spot where a pharyngoesophageal diverticulum (Zenker's diverticulum) is more likely to occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hypopharyngeal diverticulum or Zenker\u2019s diverticulum It is a pulsion diverticulum where pharyngeal mucosa herniates through the Killian\u2019s dehiscence\u2014 a weak area between two parts of the inferior constrictor. It is probably due to spasm of cricopharyngeal sphincter or its incoordinated contractions during the act of deglutition. It is usually seen after 60 years of age. PATHOLOGY- Herniation of pouch starts in the midline. It is at first behind the oesophagus and then comes to lie on its left. Mouth of the sac is wider than the opening of oesophagus and food preferentially enters the sac. CLINICAL FEATURES Dysphagia is the prominent feature. It appears after a few swallows when the pouch gets filled with food, and presses on the oesophagus. Gurgling sound is produced on swallowing. Undigested food may regurgitate at night, when patient is recumbent, causing cough and aspiration pneumonia. Patient is often malnourished due to dysphagia. TREATMENT - Excision of pouch and cricopharyngeal myotomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Similar triangular area between circular fibres of cricopharyngeus and longitudinal fibres of oesophagus is Laimers triangle or Lamier-hackermann's area. Killian's dehiscence is located above the Cricopharyngeus whereas Laimer\u2019s dehiscence is located below Cricopharyngeus</p>\n<p></p>",
