      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Decreases the need for intubation Compared to Non-invasive ventilation HFNC had not been able to show any benefit of avoiding intubation however when compared to simple oxygen delivery devices like nasal cannula or oxygen mask it has been found to decrease the need for intubation. Most often it is compared to NIV.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A- HFNC delivers humidified oxygen and it is necessary to deliver humidified oxygen otherwise dry oxygen with such high flows will inhibit ciliary activity. Option B- It is possible to deliver 100% oxygen with high-flow nasal cannula while with nasal cannula maximum oxygen delivered is 44%. Option D- They are accurate in terms of oxygen delivery.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>20 min Proparacaine is only available as drops used for topical analgesia in ophthalmology. It is an amino ester. Duration of action is 15-20 minutes Indications: Proparacaine is primarily used in ophthalmology for procedures such as tonometry (measuring intraocular pressure), foreign body removal from the eye, and other diagnostic or therapeutic eye examinations. It is commonly used before procedures like cataract surgery to provide temporary anesthesia. Formulation: Proparacaine is available as eye drops and is typically administered directly onto the surface of the eye. Mode of Action: Proparacaine belongs to the class of medications known as local anesthetics. It works by blocking sodium channels in nerve cell membranes, preventing the transmission of pain signals. The numbing effect occurs rapidly, usually within seconds of administration, and lasts for a short duration, typically around 15-20 minutes.</p>\n<p></p>",
