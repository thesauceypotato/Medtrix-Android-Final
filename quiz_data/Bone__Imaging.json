It is the first investigation to be done in case of suspected patients. In the early stage of disease, x-rays are usually normal. X-ray can show signs of bone involvement, such as vertebral collapse, narrowing of intervertebral discs, or paraspinal abscesses. However, it is not sensitive enough to detect early disease or to assess soft tissue involvement (e.g., abscesses).
