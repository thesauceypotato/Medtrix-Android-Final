      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hyperopia Vitreoretinal traction is responsible for the occurrence of most RRD . As the vitreous becomes more syneretic (liquefied) with age, a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) occurs. Myopia, aphakia or pseudophakia, familial conditions, and inflammation are among the common causes.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Retinal necrosis with a retinal break formation occurs; fluid from the vitreous cavity can flow through the breaks and detach the retina without overt vitreoretinal traction.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B . In most eyes, the vitreous gel separates from the retina without any sequelae. However, in certain eyes, strong vitreoretinal adhesions are present, and the occurrence of a PVD can lead to a retinal tear formation ; then, fluid from the liquefied vitreous can seep under the tear, leading to a retinal detachment. Option: C . A number of conditions exist that predispose to a PVD by prematurely accelerating the liquefaction of the vitreous gel. Option: D . This commonly occurs in acute retinal necrosis syndrome and in cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>A given amount of vitreoretinal traction will cause retinal tears if the retina is thinner, as in lattice degeneration of the retina.</p>\n<p></p>",

The retina, the innermost tunic of the eyeball, is a thin, delicate, and transparent membrane. It is the most highly-developed tissue of the eye. It appears purplish-red due to the visual purple of the rods and underlying vascular choroid. Option: C. Grossly , it can be divided into two distinct regions: the posterior pole and peripheral retina, separated by the so-called retinal equator. Option: D. The posterior pole refers to the area of the retina posterior to the retinal equator. The posterior pole of the retina includes two distinct areas: the optic disc and the macula lutea. The posterior pole of the retina is best examined by slit-lamp indirect biomicroscopy using +78 D and +90 D lenses and by direct ophthalmoscopy.</p>\n<p></p>",
