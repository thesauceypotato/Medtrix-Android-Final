      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Criminal Negligence Criminal negligence is when a person does an act which is in regard to the obvious risk to the safety of human life. In this case, the surgeon was well aware of his drunk condition even before starting the surgery and was visibly affected due to this . Neglecting the obvious after effects of drinking and carrying on with the surgery which led to the blood vessel rupture and eventually, death makes the surgeon directly responsible for the patient\u2019s death. Criminal Negligence is statutorily embodied in section 304A of Indian Penal Code (IPC) \u2013 Causing Death by negligence: \u201cWhoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide , shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years.

In Civil Negligence, the patient directly approaches the court, demanding the compensation whereas in criminal negligence, the patient approaches police & a case is filed by the police. IPC NOTE S.336 Any rash or negligent act, threatening/ endangering the life/ safety of patient Eg: Doctor conducts delivery under the influence of Alcohol S.337 Any rash / negligent act causing hurt to the patient, punishment \u2013 upto 6 months (or) 500 (or) both.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Defence Wounds The image showed a wound on the palmar side of hand , suggesting he/she was trying to grasp the weapon; the wound is also noted along fingers suggesting some double edged weapon is likely the crime weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Defense wounds- Defense wounds are seen when the victim attempts to ward off a knife either by seizing it or by raising forearms and hands in order to protect other body regions (head, neck, chest). Traditionally a distinction is made in the literature between active and passive defense wounds. According to this distinction active defense wounds occur when the victim grasps the knife with the hand with the injury then being located on the palmar side of the hand. The passive wound type is sustained when the victim raises their hands or arms to protect the attacked body region ; in this case the injuries will primarily be located on the extensor side. If in spite of multiple stabs, no defense injuries are found, it has to be considered that the victim may have been unable to react or impaired in his ability to defend himself already before the use of sharp force: for example in knife attacks on a sleeping person, in unexpected assaults and in victims made unconscious before the attack. The absence of defense wounds is also observed when the victim is held or tied.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Postmortem Cuts - Postmortem injuries are those injuries that definitely occurred after death. Perimortem injuries are those injuries that occurred around the time of death, perhaps a few days or a few hours before death, or a few hours, few days, a few weeks, or even possibly a few months or longer after death. Option B. Antemortem Injury - An injury that occurs before death with evidence of healing (re- formed bone with round, smooth edges) . Perimortem: An injury that occurs at or around the time of death when the wound is still fresh (sharp, clean edges) , with no evidence of Option D - 7 Hour Old Injury - this is surely a defense wound - so incorrect.</p>\n<p></p>",
