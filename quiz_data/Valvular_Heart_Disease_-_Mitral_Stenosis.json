      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Transvenous pacemaker placement and pacing at a heart rate of 90 beats/min The left atrial to left ventricular pressure gradient is highly dependent on heart rate since diastolic duration is inversely related to heart rate. In the setting of mitral stenosis, a long diastolic time allows more time for the left atrium to empty, and thus lower pressures. Hence, sinus bradycardia is advantageous in the setting of mitral stenosis, and inducing a faster heart rate via pacemaker would be harmful. The loss of atrial systole during atrial fibrillation is often poorly tolerated in mitral stenosis, and regaining sinus rhythm would undoubtedly lower atrial pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: C. However, the vast majority of patients with mitral stenosis are unable to maintain sinus rhythm long term as their atria tend to be very dilated. Option: A, D. - Diuretics and percutaneous mitral valvotomy will lower left atrial pressure.</p>\n<p></p>",

As the heart rate climbs with exercise, diastolic filling time declines. Thus, transit time for blood to flow across the stenosed mitral valve is reduced and both left atrial pressure and mitral valve gradient increase.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B, D. As left atrial pressure rises, so do \u201cupstream\u201d pressures such as the pulmonary artery pressure. Option: C.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest The patient, with a systolic click murmur in the absence of dynamic change, likely has bicuspid aortic valve (AV) stenosis. The diagnosis is more commonly associated with a coarctation of the aorta whose flow murmur is best heard over the posterior aspect between the shoulder blades, slightly to the left of the midline. In the presence of hypertension and radial-femoral delay , there is enough evidence on examination to support imaging of the aorta to rule out coarctation. A CT scan (or magnetic resonance imaging) of the chest would show the coarctation .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Another appropriate test would be transthoracic echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis of a bicuspid AV and to assess the degree of aortic stenosis. Echocardiography is often used to view the descending thoracic aorta to determine the degree of coarctation; however, if the aorta is not well visualized by echocardiography, other imaging is indicated to rule out the coarctation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A, B. A coronary angiogram or Holter monitor is unlikely to be helpful unless it is coupled with an aortogram, which might provide the diagnosis, but there may be an increased danger due to the potential for coarctation, which could be difficult to cross with the catheter. This patient most likely does not have coronary artery disease. The murmur and clinical presentation are not benign, and a thorough evaluation is warranted. This patient\u2019s syncopal event is related to aortic stenosis or coarctation with significant stenosis and the inability to adequately increase cardiac output, especially with postexercise vasodilatation.</p>\n<p></p>",
