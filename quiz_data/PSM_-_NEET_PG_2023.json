IV iron sucrose or ferric carboxy maltose , in cases of anemia detected late in pregnancy, or unable to tolerate oral iron or poor compliance. Based on ICMR, anaemia is divided into the following: Mild 10-10.9gm% Moderate 7-9.9gm% Severe <7gm% Very Severe <4gm% Management of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy: Oral preparation s : The dose is approximately 180-200 mg of elemental iron per day (equivalent to 3 tablets).The treatment is continued until blood parameters return to normal levels. The reticulocyte count is the earliest indicator of improvement. After that, a maintenance dose of one tablet per day is taken. The maintenance dose should be continued throughout the pregnancy and for three months after delivery to replenish iron stores. Parenteral preparation : Parenteral iron is indicated in patients on hemo/peritoneal dialysis, malabsorption syndrome, and pregnant females with severe anaemia that is seen for the first time during the last 8-10 weeks. The rise in haemoglobin concentration after parenteral therapy is similar to that with oral iron , approximately 7 to 1 gm % per week . Parenteral iron is not given for a rapid rise in haemoglobin concentration. The main advantage of parenteral therapy over oral iron is the certainty of administration. Indications of Blood Transfusion: Severe anaemia seen beyond 36 weeks of pregnancy. Anaemia due to active blood loss. Refractory anemia. Associated infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>We use oral iron preparations till 30 weeks , and parenteral preparation in 30-36 weeks and blood transfusion after 36 weeks.
