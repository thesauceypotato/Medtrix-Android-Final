Option C- Combined spinal epidural is neither required and almost never used for cesarean section Option D- Giving GA to pregnant patients should be avoided due to the high risk of aspiration. Moreover, associated laryngeal edema in PIH can make intubation become more difficult.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Morphine Although theoretically morphine may worsen the biliary colic by increasing the tone of sphincter of Oddi however this has been unfounded by current studies. Opioid Medications: Opioid analgesics are generally avoided for colicky pain unless absolutely necessary due to the risk of side effects, dependence, and constipation. They may be considered in severe cases under the supervision of a healthcare provider. Avoiding Certain Medications: Some medications, such as opioids and anticholinergic drugs, can exacerbate colicky pain or underlying conditions. For example, opioids can slow down intestinal motility and worsen pain in conditions like diverticulitis or inflammatory bowel disease.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Iv adenosine This is supraventricular tachycardia. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, a vagal maneuver may be tried. If no response 6 mg IV adenosine is given. Still, if there is no response 12 mg of IV adenosine is given. Still, if no response other drugs like amiodarone may be tried. However, if the patient is hemodynamically unstable then immediate cardioversion should be done Acute Management (During an SVT Episode) : Vagal Maneuvers: These include techniques like the Valsalva maneuver (forced expiration against a closed airway) and carotid sinus massage (performed by a healthcare professional). These maneuvers can help stimulate the vagus nerve, potentially slowing down the heart rate and terminating the SVT episode . Adenosine: Adenosine is a medication often used in a healthcare setting to terminate SVT. It is administered as a rapid IV push and typically results in a brief pause in the heart rhythm, allowing the sinus node to regain control. Calcium Channel Blockers: Medications like verapamil or diltiazem may be used to slow down the heart rate during an SVT episode. Beta-Blockers : In some cases, beta-blockers like metoprolol or propranolol can be effective in slowing down the heart rate during an SVT episode.</p>\n<p></p>",
