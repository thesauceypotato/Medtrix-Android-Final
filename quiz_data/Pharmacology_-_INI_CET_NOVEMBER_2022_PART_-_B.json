It appears to reduce IOP by increasing outflow of aqueous humour through the trabecular meshwork and decreasing episcleral venous pressure via its inhibitory effect on rho kinases. It is used in the treatment and management of glaucoma and ocular hypotension .

Like other forms of CAH, 17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency impairs the efficiency of cortisol synthesis, resulting in high levels of ACTH secretion and hyperplasia of the adrenal glands. Option D . Phosphodiesterase- A phosphodiesterase inhibitor is a drug that blocks one or more of the five subtypes of the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE), thereby preventing the inactivation of the intracellular second messengers, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by the respective PDE subtype(s).</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA alpha- reductase inhibitor 5 Another approach to blocking androgen uptake by prostatic cells is to prevent androgen binding to nuclear androgen receptors (e.g. Flutamide).

Urinary excretion of an acidic drug can be increased by the alkalinisation of urine, whereas a basic drug can be increasingly excreted in the urine by acidification of urine. Non Ionised compounds are reabsorbed more rapidly than ionised polar molecules. Alkalinisation of the urine by IV sodium bicarbonate ionisation of aspirin molecules increases.

Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering cells of the heart and blood vessel walls, resulting in lower blood pressure.
