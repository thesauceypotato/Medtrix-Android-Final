Empirical therapy with PPIs is only indicated in patients with dyspepsia and symptoms that strongly suggest GERD (heartburn and regurgitation).

Oesophageal manometry and ambulatory pH recording (with or without impedance measurement) are recommended to establish the diagnosis and guide management for patients with atypical or persistent symptoms despite PPI therapy.

However, further signs and symptoms of heart failure such as peripheral pitting edema, increased jugular venous distention, nocturia, and tachycardia would be expected at this point. Moreover, except for obesity, this patient has no risk factors for heart disease (e.g., history of smoking, rheumatic fever, or hypertension), making a different etiology of her symptoms more likely. Option: B. Salmeterol is a long-acting beta agonist that is used in the management of moderate chronic asthma. Salmeterol would be a reasonable next step in the escalation of her asthma therapy because this patient currently uses a short-acting beta agonist and a corticosteroid inhaler. However, other comorbidities that potentially worsen asthma should be treated before escalating asthma therapy. Option: C. Oral prednisone is used to treat acute asthma exacerbations or severe, therapy-refractory chronic asthma.

Symptoms include a long history of heartburn and other reflux symptoms, which are usually more severe and frequent than those experienced by most reflux patients.

Affected individuals commonly present with retrosternal pain, dysphagia to solids, and food impaction. Although this patient presents with retrosternal pain, biopsy would likely show numerous eosinophils within multiple layers of the esophagus rather than metaplastic changes. Option: D. Hypermotile esophageal contractions are seen in spastic disorders of the esophagus (e.g., nutcracker esophagus, diffuse esophageal spasms).

Additionally, it does not affect the airways and does not cause cyanotic attacks. Option: D. Achalasia is very rare in infants and occurs most commonly in middle-aged individuals.

Reflux esophagitis is the most common complication of GERD as the gastric acid causes inflammation, erosions, and ulcers of the esophageal mucosa. The inflamed esophageal mucosa heals via fibrosis, forming esophageal strictures. Initiation of appropriate therapy (e.g., PPI, lifestyle modifications) should be implemented to prevent this complication.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Esophageal stricture can be caused by severe esophagitis or BE. If a patient has a stricture without Barrett\u2019s esophagus, reflux esophagitis should be ruled out before ascribing the stricture to it. Normal acid exposure and no endoscopic or CT evidence of cancer may suggest a drug-induced chemical injury as the cause of the stricture. Dilation is usually effective in correcting drug-induced dysphagia. Patients with underlying esophagitis and a distal esophageal stricture secondary to gastroesophageal reflux can also develop drug-induced injuries.

The most important risk factors for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma are cigarette smoking and chronic alcohol use, both of which are present in this patient. Additional risk factors include achalasia and caustic esophageal injury. However, this patient's GERD with reflux esophagitis does not increase the risk of him developing esophageal SCC GERD/Barrets esophagus increases risk of adenocarcinoma not SCC. Moreover, esophageal SCC typically occurs in the upper 2/3rd of the esophagus, whereas this patient has endoscopic evidence of distal esophageal disease. Option: C. Risk factors for laryngeal carcinoma include cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, which are both present in this patient.

Patients with typical signs of GERD do not require endoscopy prior to initiating conservative treatment. Since this patient neither has alarm symptoms nor a history of chronic GERD, esophagogastroduodenoscopy is not indicated for the time being. PPI Screening for H. pylori infection via urea breath test is not indicated in patients with GERD alone because the prevalence of H. pylori infection among patients with GERD is not greater than in the general population. In fact, the prevalence of H. pylori is actually lower in patients with complicated or severe GERD. Screening for H. pylori infection is only indicated in patients with active peptic ulcer disease (PUD), a past history of PUD, atrophic gastritis, and/or gastric MALT lymphomas. Option: D. Barium swallow is the confirmatory test for esophageal diverticula (e.g., Zenker diverticulum), which may also present with halitosis and retrosternal discomfort, mimicking GERD.
