The species has a worldwide distribution. Microsporum canis is among the most common dermatophytes associated with tinea capitis and tinea corporis. Unlike some dermatophyte species, M. canis typically does not cause large epidemics. Humans become infected as a result of direct or indirect contact with infected pets. Microsporum canis is a zoophilic dermatophyte, the causative agent of human and animal dermatophytosis worldwide. M. can is. Microsporum canis is generally regarded as a zoophilic dermatophyte, but it often attacks humans. Most human infections are acquired from animals.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A.
