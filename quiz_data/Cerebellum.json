      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dysarthria The given slide is the cerebellum Cerebellum lesion causes- dysarthria Histology Of cerebellum</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Dysarthria is a speech sound disorder resulting from neurological injury of the motor component of the motor\u2013speech system and is characterized by the poor articulation of phonemes. In other words, it is a condition in which problems effectively occur with the muscles that help produce speech, often making it very difficult to pronounce words. It is unrelated to problems with understanding language.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Apraxia Apraxia is a motor disorder caused by damage to the brain (specifically the posterior parietal cortex or corpus callosum, which causes difficulty with motor planning to perform tasks or movements. The nature of the damage determines the disorder's severity, and the absence of sensory loss or paralysis helps to explain the level of difficulty. Option: B. Aphasia Global aphasia is a severe form of nonfluent aphasia, caused by damage to the left side of the brain, that affects receptive and expressive language skills (needed for both written and oral language) as well as auditory and visual comprehension. This type of aphasia often results from a large lesion of the left perisylvian cortex. The lesion is caused by an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and is associated with damage to Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and insular regions which are associated with aspects of language. Option: D. Verbal dyspraxia Developmental verbal dyspraxia ( DVD ), also known as childhood apraxia of speech ( CAS ) and developmental apraxia of speech ( DAS ), [1] is a condition in which an individual has problems saying sounds, syllables, and words. This is not because of muscle weakness or paralysis. The brain has problems planning to move the body parts (e.g., lips, jaw, tongue) needed for speech. The individual knows what they want to say, but their brain has difficulty coordinating the muscle movements necessary to say those words. DVD/CAS is a motor disorder, which means that the problem is located in the brain and its signals, and not in the mouth. In most cases, the cause is unknown. Possible causes include genetic syndromes and disorders. Recent research has focused on the significance of the FOXP2</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>There are many potential causes of dysarthria . They include toxic, metabolic, degenerative diseases, traumatic brain injury, or thrombotic or embolic stroke. Degenerative diseases include parkinsonism, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Niemann-Pick disease, and Friedreich's ataxia. Toxic and metabolic conditions include Wilson's disease, hypoxic encephalopathies such as drowning, and central pontine myelinolysis. These result in lesions to key areas of the brain involved in planning, executing, or regulating motor operations in skeletal muscles (i.e. muscles of the limbs), including muscles of the head and neck (dysfunction of which characterizes dysarthria). These can result in dysfunction or failure of: the motor or somatosensory cortex of the brain, corticobulbar pathways, the cerebellum, basal nuclei (consisting of the putamen, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, substantia nigra, etc.), brainstem (from which the cranial nerves originate), or the neuromuscular junction (in diseases such as myasthenia gravis) which block the nervous system's ability to activate motor units and effect correct range and strength of movements.</p>\n<p></p>",
