      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>AVN In this image left side crescent sign (+) indicate AVN The majority of the blood supply to the head of the femur comes from the medial and lateral circumflex branches of the profunda femoris, which itself is a branch of the femoral artery (the profunda femoris is the deep penetrating branch of the upper thigh). The medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries anastomose to form a ring around the neck of the femur, from which many small arteries branch off to perfuse the femoral head.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The arteries are easily compressed causing AVN. Because of limited collateral circulation, disruption of the blood supply to the head of the femur can lead to ischemia and subsequent necrosis. If restoration of blood supply does not occur promptly, this will lead to the progressive death of osteocytes followed by the collapse of the articular surface, and eventually by degenerative arthritis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option D. Rheumatoid arthritis : Bilateral joint pain Morning stiffness Age is not a criteria Most common area involved is upper cervical spine (Aka craniovertebral junction) Craniovertebral junction involvement: RA>AS>Gout usually not affected in Hip Option B. TB hip: Stage of synovitis: The hip joint is held in flexion, external rotation and abduction causing apparent lengthening (FABER) Joint is in position of maximal capacity. Stage of early arthritis: Damage to articular cartilage sets in. Deformity: flexion, adduction and internal rotation (FADIR) Stage of advanced arthritis: Further advancement of destruction and above clinical signs Advanced arthritis with subluxation or dislocation Option C. Ankylosing spondylitis: usually presents with lower back ache and sacroiliac joint involvement Usually limitation of spinal flexion present.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Avascular necrosis is a disease that results from the temporary or permanent loss of blood supply to the bone. When blood supply is cut off, the bone tissue dies and the bone collapses. If avascular necrosis happens near a joint, the joint surface may collapse.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
