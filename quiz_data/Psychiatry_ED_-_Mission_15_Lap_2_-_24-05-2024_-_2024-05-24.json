Medications typically employed include long-acting opioids such as methadone or buprenorphine. Due to their agonist action at opioid receptors, both medications effectively suppress withdrawal symptoms. Other opioids, like dextro-propoxyphene, may also be utilized. Detoxification medications are generally required for a period of 2-3 weeks. An alternative approach involves using clonidine for detoxification. However, clonidine offers considerably less symptom reduction compared to buprenorphine or methadone. As a result, clonidine is often used as an adjunct to methadone or buprenorphine during the detoxification process.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>\u21b3 Reference: Kaplan & Sadock\u2019s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th edition, Page No 295.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
