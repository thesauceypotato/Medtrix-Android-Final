Cerebellar cortex features: The most prominent feature of the cerebellar cortex is the granule cell layer, composed of vast numbers of very small neurons called granule cells. Each granule cell has a few short dendrites within the granule cell layer. Each granule cell axon projects into the molecular layer and bifurcates into parallel fibers which extend parallel to the long axis of each folium. Above the granule cell layer lies the molecular layer, consisting almost entirely of granule cell axons together with Purkinje cell dendrites (and with relatively few cell bodies). At the boundary between granule cells and molecular layers are found the cell bodies of Purkinje cells, the sole output cells of the cerebellar cortex. Axons enter and leave the cortex through the underlying white matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A.

Representative images of the vestibular nuclei Option: D. Red Nuclei</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The cerebellar cortex has three layers: an external molecular layer, a Purkinje cell layer that is only one cell thick, and an internal granular layer. There are five types of neurons in the cortex: Purkinje, granule, basket, stellate, and Golgi cells. The Purkinje cells are among the largest neurons in the CNS. They have extensive dendritic arbors that extend throughout the molecular layer. Their axons, which are the only output from the cerebellar cortex, project to the deep cerebellar nuclei, especially the dentate nucleus, where they form inhibitory synapses. They also make inhibitory connections with neurons in the vestibular nuclei. The cerebellar granule cells, whose cell bodies are in the granular layer, receive excitatory input from the mossy fibers and innervate the Purkinje cells. Each sends an axon to the molecular layer, where the axon bifurcates to form a T. The branches of the T are straight and run long distances; thus, they are called parallel fibers. The dendritic trees of the Purkinje cells are markedly flattened and oriented at right angles to the parallel fibers. The parallel fibers form excitatory synapses on the dendrites of many Purkinje cells, and the parallel fibers and Purkinje dendritic trees form a grid of remarkably regular proportions. The other three types of neurons in the cerebellar cortex are inhibitory interneurons. Basket cells are located in the molecular layer. They receive excitatory input from the parallel fibers and each project to many Purkinje cells. Their axons form a basket around the cell body and the axon hillock of each Purkinje cell they innervate. Stellate cells are similar to basket cells but are located in the more superficial molecular layer. Golgi cells are located in the granular layer. Their dendrites project into the molecular layer and receive excitatory input from the parallel fibers.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pyramidal cells Most of the neurons in the cerebral cortex are arranged vertically and most abundant neurons are the different pyramidal cells (very large giant pyramidal cells found in the layer V of the regions of the motor cortex are called Betz cells).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The neocortex is generally arranged in six layers. Molecular (plexiform) layer. External granular layer. External pyramidal layer. Internal granular layer. Internal pyramidal layer. Multiform (fusiform) layer. The most common neuronal type is the pyramidal cell with an extensive vertical dendritic tree that may reach to the cortical surface. Their cell bodies can be found in all cortical layers except layer I. The axons of these cells usually give recurrent collaterals that turn back and synapse on the superficial portions of the dendritic trees. Layer I - This layer is called the molecular layer. As you can see from the diagram, it has very few neurons and cells. Instead, it is mainly composed of dendrites and axons that extend from lower levels of the neocortex. Layer II- Because this is one of the outer layers, and it is composed of granule cells, scientists named it the external granule layer. Function- Receives inputs from other areas of the neocortex. Layer III- This is the external pyramidal cell layer. Pyramidal cells make up this layer; they are called \"pyramidal\" because their somas are triangular shaped. Function- Receives input from other cortical regions and outputs to other cortical columns. Layer IV- Located deeper within the neocortex, and composed of granule cells, this layer is thus called the internal granule layer. Function- Granule cells in this layer receive sensory input and relay it to adjacent neocortex columns. Layer IV is very thick in the primary sensory cortex (i.e. the primary visual cortex). Layer V- Another layer of pyramidal cells makes up the neocortex. The cells in this internal pyramidal cell layer are larger than those in Layer III. Function- Layer V is involved heavily in making motor movements. Layer VI- Many different types of cells make up this layer. Its structure isn't very homogenous, so it was called the multiform layer. Function- Receiving and integrating information from the brainstem and outputs to the thalamus.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect Options:- Option: A. Stellate cells (SCs) are inhibitory GABAergic interneurons that make-up neuronal circuits that control the output from the cerebellar cortex by regulating the firing properties of Purkinje cells. Option: C. Granule cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus play a role in the perception and response to sounds in our environment. Option: D. Basket cells are inhibitory interneurons in the cerebellar cortex that innervate Purkinje cells with a unique terminal called the pinceau.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The neocortex is arranged in six layers. Afferents from the specific nuclei of the thalamus terminate primarily in layer IV; the nonspecific nuclei project to layers I to IV. Pyramidal neurons, the most common cell type in the cortex, have extensive vertical dendritic trees that reach toward the cortical surface. Their cell bodies are found in all cortical layers except layer I. Pyramidal neurons are excitatory neurons that release glutamate at their terminals, and they are the only projection neurons of the cortex. The other cortical cell types are local circuit interneurons and are classified based on their shape, pattern of projection, and neurotransmitter. Inhibitory interneurons (basket cells and chandelier cells) release GABA as their neurotransmitter. Basket cells have long axonal endings that surround the soma of pyramidal neurons, they account for most inhibitory synapses on the pyramidal soma and dendrites. Chandelier cells are a powerful source of inhibition of pyramidal neurons because their axonal endings terminate exclusively on the initial segment of the pyramidal cell axon. Their terminal boutons form short vertical rows that resemble candlesticks, thus accounting for their name. Spiny stellate cells are excitatory neurons that release glutamate; these multipolar interneurons are located primarily in layer IV and are a major recipient of sensory information arising from the thalamus. In addition to being organized into layers, the cerebral cortex is also organized into columns. Neurons within a column have similar response properties, suggesting they comprise a local processing network (g., orientation and ocular dominance columns in the visual cortex).</p>\n<p></p>",
