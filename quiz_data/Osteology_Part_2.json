Golfer's elbow (medial epicondylitis) is a painful condition caused by a small tear or an inflammation or irritation in the origin of the flexor muscles of the forearm from the medial epicondyle. Avoidance of repetitive bending ( flexing ) of the forearm is advised in order to not compress the ulnar nerve. Nursemaid's elbow or pulled elbow is a radial head subluxation and occurs in toddlers when the child is lifted by the wrist. It is caused by a partial tear (or loose) of the annular ligament and thus the radial head to slip out of position.</p>\n<p></p>",

Ossification of the Upper end of Humerus The proximal humerus and shaft are ossified from four centres: one each in the shaft , head, and greater and lesser tubercles. The centre for the shaft appears near its middle in the eighth week of intrauterine life and gradually extends towards the ends. Most growth occurs at the distal end of the bone. Ossification begins in the head before birth (20%) or in the first 6 months afterwards ; the greater tubercle starts to ossify during the first year in females and the second year in males; the lesser tubercle begins to ossify at about the fifth year. By the sixth year, the centres for the head and tubercles have joined to form a single large epiphysis . The proximal humeral epiphysis fuses with the shaft of the humerus at about the thirteenth or fourteenth year in females, and between the fourteenth to sixteenth year in males.</p>\n<p></p>",
