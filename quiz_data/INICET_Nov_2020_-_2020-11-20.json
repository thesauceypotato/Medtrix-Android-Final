This rise in fibrinogen contributes significantly to the increased ESR. ESR: The ESR can increase up to four times during pregnancy due to the increased levels of fibrinogen and globulin. Platelet Count: There may be a slight fall in platelet count during pregnancy, commonly due to gestational thrombocytopenia, which is caused by hemodilution and increased platelet consumption. This condition usually has no adverse effect on pregnancy and is often observed in the third trimester. Coagulation Factors: There is an increase in the plasma levels of several coagulation factors, including factors 1 (fibrinogen), 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Factors 2, 5, and 12 remain unchanged or mildly increased, while factors 11 and 13 are slightly decreased. Clotting Time: Clotting time is generally unaffected by pregnancy.

It has some degree of H1 blocking property also. It is therefore known as NSSA (Nor adrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressant).

It is caused by the hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the Pylorus, which results in constriction and obstruction of the gastric outlet. First-born male infants are at the highest risk for developing CHPS. Projectile, non-bilious vomiting is a common symptom in infants with CHPS. A palpable olive-shaped mass is usually felt in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, and visible peristalsis can be observed moving from left to right, followed by projectile vomiting. Infants with CHPS develop a characteristic metabolic abnormality including hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria. Loss of hydrochloric acid leads to metabolic alkalosis and hypochloremia due to persistent vomiting. The kidneys try to compensate for alkalosis by secreting Na+ and HCO3, but the loss of sodium stimulates aldosterone secretion leading to the loss of potassium ions (hypokalemia). Loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH resulting in paradoxical aciduria. Treatment involves rehydration and correction of metabolic abnormalities before surgery, and the Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is the standard surgical procedure for CHPS.</li><li>\u27a4 CHPS (congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis) is most commonly seen in infants between 2 to 8 weeks of age.</li><li>\u27a4 It is caused by the hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the Pylorus, which results in constriction and obstruction of the gastric outlet.</li><li>\u27a4 First-born male infants are at the highest risk for developing CHPS.</li><li>\u27a4 Projectile, non-bilious vomiting is a common symptom in infants with CHPS.</li><li>\u27a4 A palpable olive-shaped mass is usually felt in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, and visible peristalsis can be observed moving from left to right, followed by projectile vomiting.</li><li>\u27a4 Infants with CHPS develop a characteristic metabolic abnormality including hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria.</li><li>\u27a4 Loss of hydrochloric acid leads to metabolic alkalosis and hypochloremia due to persistent vomiting.</li><li>\u27a4 The kidneys try to compensate for alkalosis by secreting Na+ and HCO3, but the loss of sodium stimulates aldosterone secretion leading to the loss of potassium ions (hypokalemia).</li><li>\u27a4 Loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH resulting in paradoxical aciduria.</li><li>\u27a4 Treatment involves rehydration and correction of metabolic abnormalities before surgery, and the Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is the standard surgical procedure for CHPS.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Firstly, ensure scene safety (make sure you're not putting yourself or the individual in further danger). Then, call for help or ask someone nearby to do so. This ensures that professional medical help is on the way. After calling for help, you\u2019d check the pulse and breathing. If the person is not breathing and/or doesn\u2019t have a pulse, you would start CPR.

Cervical mucus thickening: OCPs increase the viscosity of cervical mucus, making it more difficult for sperm to enter the uterus and fertilize an ovum. Produce static endometrial hypoplasia: OCPs cause the endometrial lining to remain thin, which further prevents implantation.
