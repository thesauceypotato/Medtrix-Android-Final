In most cases, femoral blood is more likely to be a better indicator of the perimortem concentration of the analyte. Peripherally located blood (e.g. from femoral veins) is preferable because it is relatively isolated from the internal organs in the chest and abdomen (blood obtained from the heart or other central regions in the chest and abdomen may have falsely elevated drug levels due to postmortem drug diffusion from the stomach) In embalmed bodies, alcohol can be estimated either in vitreous or in muscle.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option B & C: They are good alternatives for the femoral vein.
