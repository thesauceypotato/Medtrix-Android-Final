      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Neither heterologous nor homologous immunity The divergence of HCV isolates within a genotype or subtype and within the same host may vary insufficiently to define a distinct genotype; these intra-genotypic differences are referred to as quasispecies and differ in sequence homology by only a few percent. The genotypic and quasispecies diversity of HCV, resulting from its high mutation rate, interferes with effective humoral immunity. Neutralizing antibodies to HCV have been demonstrated, but they tend to be short-lived. HCV infection does not induce lasting immunity against reinfection with different virus isolates or even the same virus isolate. Thus, neither heterologous nor homologous immunity appears to develop commonly after acute HCV infection.</p>\n<p></p>",
