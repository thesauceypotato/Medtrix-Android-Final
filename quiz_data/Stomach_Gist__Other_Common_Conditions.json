The proximal stomach is transected at the level of the incisura at a margin of at least 6 cm because studies have documented tumor spread as far as 5 cm laterally from the primary tumor, although some experts indicate that a 4 cm margin is adequate. Frozen section analysis should be performed before reconstruction. The distal margin is the proximal duodenum.

If the patient is left with a small area of stomach proximal to the area of resection, a Roux-en-Y reconstruction should be performed to reduce the risk of alkaline reflux esophagitis. For proximal lesions of the fundus or cardia, a total gastrectomy with a Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy or proximal gastrectomy is equivalent from an oncologic perspective. The postoperative anastomotic leak rate is higher for an esophagojejunostomy , but the margin is typically larger than for a gastrojejunostomy . When a negative margin can be achieved, a gastrojejunostomy is performed. However, to construct a tension-free anastomosis to the distal esophagus, a Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy is usually required. A hand-sewn or stapled technique may be used. For early gastric cancer with limited penetration of the gastric wall and no evidence of lymph node metastases, EMR (Endoscopic Mucosal Resection) can be carried out.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The incidence of gastric cancer, particularly in the distal region, is decreasing, while GE junction tumors are on the rise.

There are two types of gastric volvulus based on the axis of rotation: organoaxial and mesenteroaxial. Primary gastric volvulus is seen in association with congenital asplenia and wandering spleen , with mesenteroaxial volvulus being more common. Secondary gastric volvulus occurs secondary to some anatomic abnormality, most commonly a diaphragmatic hernia. Major symptoms of gastric volvulus include acute abdominal pain, distention, vomiting, and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Borchardt's triad is a characteristic feature of gastric volvulus. Diagnosis is confirmed by X-ray of the abdomen, barium contrast study or endoscopy</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Options A, B, and D : The sudden onset of constant and severe upper abdominal pain, recurrent retching with the production of little vomitus, and the inability to pass an NG tube constitute Borchardt\u2019s triad . Gastric volvulus : Gastric volvulus is an uncommon condition. Torsion occurs along the stomach\u2019s longitudinal axis (organoaxial) in approximately two-thirds of cases and along the vertical axis (mesenteroaxial) in one-third. Usually, organoaxial gastric volvulus occurs acutely and is associated with a diaphragmatic defect, whereas mesenteroaxial volvulus is partial (<180 degrees), recurrent, and not associated with a diaphragmatic defect. In adults, the diaphragmatic defects are usually traumatic or paraesophageal hernias, whereas, in children, congenital defects such as the foramen of Bochdalek or eventration are involved. The major symptoms at presentation are abdominal pain that is acute in onset, distention, vomiting, and upper GI hemorrhage. The sudden onset of constant and severe upper abdominal pain, recurrent retching with the production of little vomitus, and the inability to pass an NG tube constitute Borchardt\u2019s triad . Plain films of the abdomen reveal a gas-filled viscus in the chest or upper abdomen. The diagnosis can be confirmed by barium contrast study or upper GI endoscopy . Acute volvulus is a surgical emergency. The stomach is reduced and uncoiled through a transabdominal approach. The diaphragmatic defect is repaired, with consideration given to a fundoplication in the setting of a paraesophageal hernia. In the unusual case in which strangulation has occurred (5% to 28%), the compromised segment of the stomach is resected. Spontaneous volvulus, without an associated diaphragmatic defect, is treated by detorsion and fixation of the stomach by gastropexy or tube gastrostomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Acute volvulus is a surgical emergency, and the stomach must be reduced and uncoiled.

The blood supply to the rectum comes from the superior, middle, and inferior rectal arteries, which are branches of the inferior mesenteric artery and internal iliac artery. The lymphatic drainage of the rectum follows the blood supply. The superior rectal lymphatics drain into the inferior mesenteric nodes and then to the para-aortic nodes. The middle and inferior rectal lymphatics drain into the internal iliac nodes and then to the common iliac nodes.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A: The lower third of the rectum is separated by distinct fascial layers from the prostate/vagina anteriorly (Denonvilliers\u2019 fascia), Option B: from the coccyx and lower two sacral vertebrae posteriorly (Waldeyer\u2019s fascia). Option C: The rectum has three lateral curvatures; the upper and lower are convex to the right, and the middle is convex to the left. On the luminal aspect, these three curves are marked by semicircular folds (Houston\u2019s valves). These fascial layers are surgically important as they act as barriers to malignant invasion and form the anatomical envelope for total mesorectal excision (TME) to achieve complete oncological clearance of rectal cancer.</p>\n<p></p>",

Option B : If better access is required, it is possible to convert the gridiron to a Rutherford Morison incision by cutting the internal oblique and transversus muscles in the line of the incision. In recent years, a transverse skin crease (Lanz) incision has become more popular, as the exposure is better and extension when needed, is easier. The incision, appropriate in length to the size and obesity of the patient, is made approximately 2 cm below the umbilicus When necessary, the incision may be extended medially, with retraction or suitable division of the rectus abdominis muscle. When the diagnosis is in doubt, particularly in the presence of intestinal obstruction, a lower midline abdominal incision is to be preferred over a right lower paramedian incision The latter, although widely practiced in the past, is difficult to extend, more difficult to close, and provides poorer access to the pelvis and peritoneal cavity.

Success, as long as the ischaemic bowel is excluded, will resolve the acute problem. In young patients, an elective sigmoid colectomy is required. It is reasonable not to offer any further treatment following successful endoscopic decompression in the elderly as there is a high death rate (~80% at two years) from causes other than recurrent volvulus. In elderly patients with co-morbidities and recurrent episodes of volvulus, the options are resection or two-point fixation with combined endoscopic/percutaneous tube insertion (gastrostomy tubes are frequently used for this purpose).
