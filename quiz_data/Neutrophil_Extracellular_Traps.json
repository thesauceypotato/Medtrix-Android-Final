      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Chromatin condensation NETosis , e. the process of formation of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETS): Extracellular fibrillar networks that concentrate antimicrobial substances at sites of infection and trap microbes, helping to prevent their spread . NET formation starts with ROS-dependent activation of an arginine deaminase that converts arginine to citrulline , leading to chromatin decondensation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) Neutrophil extracellular traps are extracellular fibrillar networks that concentrate antimicrobial substances at sites of infection and trap microbes, helping to prevent their spread. Neutrophils produce them in response to infectious pathogens ( mainly bacteria and fungi ) and inflammatory mediators (e.g., chemokines, cytokines [mainly interferons], complement proteins, and ROS ). The extracellular traps consist of a dense meshwork of nuclear chromatin that binds and concentrates granule proteins such as antimicrobial peptides and enzymes. In this process, the nuclei of the neutrophils are lost , leading to the death of the cells .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Causes death of neutrophils. True . Option: C. Detected in blood in patients with sepsis. True . Option: D. Plays a role in the pathogenesis of SLE. True .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The nuclear chromatin in the NETs , which includes histones and associated DNA, has been postulated to be a source of nuclear antigens in systemic autoimmune diseases , particularly lupus , in which individuals react against their DNA and nucleoproteins. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). (A) Healthy neutrophils with nuclei stained red and cytoplasm stained green. (B) Release of nuclear material from neutrophils (note that two have lost their nuclei), forming extracellular traps. (C) Electron micrograph of bacteria (staphylococci) trapped in NETS.
