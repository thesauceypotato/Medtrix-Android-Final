It limits the burst of action potentials in the phrenic nerve, effectively decreasing the tidal volume and regulating the respiratory rate. The absence of the centre results in an increase in the depth of respiration and a decrease in respiratory rate. The apneustic centre of the lower pons appears to promote inhalation by constant stimulation of the neurons in the medulla oblongata. The apneustic centre sends signals to the dorsal group in the medulla to delay the 'switch off', the inspiratory off switch (IOS) signal of the inspiratory ramp provided by the pneumotaxic centre.

The spinothalamic tract consists of two adjacent pathways: anterior and lateral. The anterior spinothalamic tract carries information about crude touch. The lateral spinothalamic tract conveys pain and temperature. The axons of the tract cells cross over (decussate) to the other side of the spinal cord via the anterior white commissure, and to the anterolateral corner of the spinal cord (hence the spinothalamic tract being part of the anterolateral system). Decussation usually occurs in 1-2 spinal nerve segments above the point of entry. The axons travel up the length of the spinal cord into the brainstem, specifically the rostral ventromedial medulla.

Damage to this nerve will result in an inability to move the eye normally. The nerve also supplies the upper eyelid muscle (levator palpebrae superioris) and is accompanied by parasympathetic fibres innervating the muscles responsible for pupil constriction (sphincter pupillae).

The downward displacement occurs because the superior oblique muscle (innervated by the fourth cranial or trochlear nerve) is unantagonized by the paralyzed superior rectus, inferior rectus and inferior oblique. The affected individual will also have ptosis, drooping of the eyelid, and mydriasis (pupil dilation). Option: B. B B is trochlear nerve Injury to the trochlear nerve causes weakness of downward eye movement with consequent vertical diplopia (double vision).

Benedikt\u2019s syndrome : In this condition, most of the tegmentum of the midbrain is damaged. Lesion includes loss of medial lemniscus, red nucleus, superior cerebellar peduncle and fibres of III nerve. Features are Loss of proprioception due to a lesion of the medial lemniscus. The pupil points downwards and laterally due to injury to the III nerve. Tremors and twitching of the opposite side due to damage to the red nucleus and superior cerebellar peduncle. Parinaud\u2019s syndrome : Lesion of superior colliculi leads to this syndrome. Features include weakness of upward gaze and vertical nystagmus due to a lesion of the superior colliculus. Argyll Robertson pupil : In this condition, the light reflex is lost but the accommodation reflex is retained due to a lesion in the vicinity of the pretectal nucleus Lesion of Midbrain</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Ipsilateral flaccid paralysis of the medial rectus Option: B. Contralateral hemiplegia Option: C. Contralateral weakness of the lower face All the above symptoms are present in Weber syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Weber's syndrome, also known as midbrain stroke syndrome or superior alternating hemiplegia , is a form of stroke that affects the medial portion of the midbrain. It involves oculomotor fascicles in the interpeduncular cisterns and cerebral peduncle so it characterizes the presence of an ipsilateral lower motor neuron type oculomotor nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia.</p>\n<p></p>",
