Its multiple activities, - numerous contraindications (coronary insufficiency, arterial hypertension, closed angle glaucoma, hyperthyroidism), - drug interactions (MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), -the required precautions (prostatic hypertrophy, cardiac insufficiency, diabetes), - potential adverse effects (tachycardia, headaches, sweating, agitation, insomnia, anxiety), as well as the fact that the effects wear out if the doses are repeated in close time proximity (tachyphylaxis) have led to the virtual (almost) abandon of this compound as a bronchodilator and analeptic. However, it remains available in some European countries like France for this indication, particularly in combinations (with theophylline, caffeine, and others ).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A - This patient likely has ingested codeine, which is an opioid. Codeine would cause a positive urine opioid screen but not a positive amphetamine screen. Option: C - Abuse of one substance is often accompanied by abuse of another, but marijuana use would not cause a false positive for amphetamines. Ephedrine use is the best explanation for this patient\u2019s positive amphetamine test. Option: D - This patient may indeed be lying about drug use, but his history of cold medicine use would raise suspicion for ephedrine ingestion. Ephedrine use is the best explanation for this patient\u2019s positive amphetamine test</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Contraindications:- Ephedrine is contraindicated for patients with severe hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, organic heart disease, coronary artery disease, angina or other cardiac disease.
