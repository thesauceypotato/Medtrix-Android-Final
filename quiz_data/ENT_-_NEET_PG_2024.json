Inflammation of a nerve may cause demyelination and associated loss of function, which can be irreversible Symptoms: Sudden onset of persistent vertigo Autonomic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sweating and pallor. Severe symptoms would normally last for a few days before gradually starting to spontaneously resolve. There should be no associated cochlear symptoms (hearing loss and tinnitus), neurological symptoms or signs of brainstem lesion The superior nerve is more commonly affected with vestibular neuritis, which may be explained by its course through a longer and more narrow bony canal making it susceptible to swelling causing entrapment Characteristic clinical examination findings with acute vestibular neuritis: Horizontal\u2013torsional spontaneous nystagmus, beating away from the side of the lesion, more vigorous without optic fixation Head thrust test positive on the same side as the lesion Gait test and Unterberger test show deviation to the side of the lesion Romberg test shows marked increase of sway Treatment: Symptomatic treatment with antiemetic medication during the acute stage is often required, and antihistamines, anticholinergic agents and antidopaminergic agents are the most commonly used drugs.

Inactive small perforations can be surgically closed by plastic flaps.

Hearing loss is conductive and slowly progressive. Tinnitus is pulsatile and of swishing character, synchronous with pulse and can be temporarily stopped by carotid pressure. Otoscopy shows a red reflex through intact tympanic membrane. \u201cRising sun\u201d appearance is seen when a tumour arises from the floor of the middle ear. \u201cPulsation sign\u201d (Brown sign) is positive, i.e. when ear canal pressure is raised with Siegel\u2019s speculum, tumour pulsates vigorously and then blanches; reverse happens with the release of pressure. When tumour presents as a polyp. In addition to hearing loss and tinnitus, there is a history of profuse bleeding from the ear. Dizziness or vertigo and facial paralysis may appear. Examination reveals a red, vascular polyp filling the meatus. It bleeds readily and profusely on manipulation or at biopsy. Cranial nerve palsies. This is a late feature appearing several years after aural symptoms. IXth to XIIth cranial nerves may be paralyzed. Audible bruit Investigations : High resolution Computed tomography (CT) scan of temporal bone. It helps to distinguish glomus tympanicum from the glomus jugulare tumour by identification of caroticojugular spine which is eroded in the latter - known as Phlep\u2019s sign MRI</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Refer explanation of correct option</p>\n<p></p>",

A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the patient\u2019s mastoid and when he stops hearing, it is brought beside the meatus. If he still hears, AC is more than BC. Alternatively, the patient is asked to compare the loudness of sound heard through air and bone conduction. Rinne test is called positive when AC is longer or louder than BC. It is seen in normal persons or those having sensorineural deafness. A negative Rinne (BC > AC) is seen in conductive deafness. A negative Rinne indicates a minimum air-bone gap of 15\u201320 dB. A prediction of air-bone gap can be made if tuning forks of 256, 512 and 1024 Hz are used. A Rinne test equal or negative for 256 Hz but positive for 512 Hz indicates air-bone gap of 20\u201330 dB. A Rinne test negative for 256 and 512 Hz but positive for 1024 Hz indicates air-bone gap of 30\u201345 dB.
