The best method to detect iron overload in these patients is by measuring the liver iron concentration. Liver biopsy or non-invasive techniques such as MRI can be used to determine the liver iron concentration. MRI T2* imaging is specifically used to assess cardiac iron overload. Serum ferritin , a marker of iron stores, is commonly used but is less accurate than direct measurement methods.

In a child, a foreign body cam settle at 3 sites: larynx, trachea or bronchus Laryngeal foreign body may cause complete or partial airway obstruction. Symptoms include croup, stridor, cough, hoarseness, dyspnea, etc. Tracheobronchial tree foreign body causes episodes of coughing, intermittent or continuous dyspnea with cyanosis, pain and intermittent hoarseness. The most common site is the right main bronchus. Diagnosis is done by chest radiograph or fluoroscopy.

Preoperative studies and patient preparation, such as adequate hydration and emptying of the stomach, are important before the procedure. Airway foreign bodies are usually removed on the same day the diagnosis is made. Risks and benefits of bronchoscopy should be carefully considered, especially when the diagnosis is unclear. Potential complications include bronchospasm, desaturation, bleeding, airway edema, and anesthesia-related risks. Laryngeal foreign bodies are less common but can be particularly dangerous due to the risk of complete laryngeal obstruction. Prompt relief with the Heimlich maneuver is necessary. Tracheal foreign bodies account for a small percentage of airway foreign body cases. Symptoms may include dysphonia, dysphagia, dry cough, or biphasic stridor. Radiographs can be helpful in diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Most airway foreign bodies lodge in a bronchus. Symptoms can vary, and some children may be asymptomatic. Chest radiographs, including expiratory films, can aid in assessment. Air trapping and mediastinal shift are characteristic findings.

Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta, most commonly occurring just beyond the left subclavian artery. However, it can occur in various other locations of the aortic arch or even in the thoracic or abdominal aorta. The narrowing of the aorta raises the upper body blood pressure , causing upper extremity hypertension. It also caused radio femoral delay in pulse.

In neonates, Hirschsprung disease is the most commonly considered among diseases that cause lower intestinal obstruction and delayed passage of meconium. Maximum limit for meconium is 48 hours Maximum limit for Urine : 24 hours M/c cause of delayed Meconium: Hirschsprung > Imperforate anus > Hypothyroidism</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Meconium , the first stool of newborns, should typically pass within the first 48 hours after birth. It is considered normal for a newborn to pass meconium within this timeframe. While some newborns pass meconium within a few hours, up to 48 hours is still within the normal range. If a newborn has not passed meconium within 48 hours, it may indicate an underlying issue that requires evaluation. The evaluation should consider the individual circumstances and overall condition of the newborn. Factors such as prematurity, maternal drug use, or certain medical conditions may warrant closer monitoring and earlier evaluation.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Gentle massage or stimulation of the abdomen or rectal area may be used to encourage bowel movements. Bowel management: Medications, enemas, or rectal irrigations may be utilized to address underlying conditions and promote bowel movements. Surgical intervention: In severe cases, surgical procedures may be necessary to address anatomical abnormalities or blockages causing the delay. Supportive care: Monitoring the baby's well-being, ensuring hydration and nutrition, and managing associated symptoms are important aspects of care.</p>\n<p></p>",
