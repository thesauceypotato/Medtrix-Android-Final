It is a disease that softens bone due to vitamin D deficiency, as it is an essential mineral of bone formation. It is a disease of a growing skeleton. Because of a lack of minerals for new bone formation \u2013 osteoid (a soft part of the bone) is laden up at the growth plate. Because bones are soft -- metaphyseal widening, cupping, and splaying are seen in X-ray pictures.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Earliest manifestation is seen in skull Craniotabes is a softening of the cranial bones and can be detected by applying pressure at the occiput or over the parietal bones. The sensation is similar to the feel of pressing into a ping-pong ball and then releasing. Craniotabes may also be secondary to osteogenesis imperfecta, hydrocephalus, and syphilis. It is a normal finding in many new born, especially near the suture lines, but it typically disappears within a few months of birth. Chest Widening of the costochondral junctions results in a rachitic rosary, which feels like the beads of a rosary as the examiner's fingers move along the costochondral junctions from rib to rib. Growth plate widening is also responsible for the enlargement at the wrists and ankles. The horizontal depression along the lower anterior chest known as Harrison groove occurs from pulling of the softened ribs by the diaphragm during inspiration. Softening of the ribs also impairs air movement and predisposes patients to atelectasis and pneumonia.

Primary treatment is a high dose of vitamin D, around 6 lakh unit oral dose. If the line of healing -- sclerotic line at the metaphyseal side of the growth plate is not seen on an X-ray within 3-4 weeks, the same dose can be repeated. If a child responds to treatment , a maintenance dose of vitamin D 400 units per day will be given. If a child doesn't respond to treatment, it comes under refractory rickets, which a multispecialty team should evaluate. Option: D.
