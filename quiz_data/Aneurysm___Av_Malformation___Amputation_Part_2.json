The images obtained are digitalized by computer and the extraneous background (bone, soft tissues, etc.) is removed to provide clearer images. The benefits of DSA are that it provides dynamic arterial flow information and can be combined with a definitive endovascular intervention when indicated. Limitations : Associated with potential complications, including bleeding, hematoma, false aneurysm formation, thrombosis, arterial dissection, distal embolization, renal dysfunction, and allergic reaction Relatively Expensive Limited to patients with concomitant intervention</p>\n<p></p>",

It usually affects the distal part of a limb because of arterial obstruction (from thrombosis, embolus, or arteritis). Dry gangrene occurs when the tissues are desiccated by gradual slowing of the bloodstream; it is typically the result of atheromatous occlusion of arteries. Wet gangrene occurs when superadded infection and putrefaction are present. Crepitus may be palpated as a result of infection by gas-forming organisms, commonly in diabetic foot problems. It should be considered a surgical emergency with urgent tissue debridement or amputation required. Zone of Demarcation : A demarcation zone between the truly viable and the dead or dying tissue will eventually appear. Separation is achieved by the development of a layer of granulation tissue, which forms between the dead and the living parts In dry gangrene, if the blood supply of the proximal tissues is adequate, the final line of demarcation appears in a matter of days and separation occurs neatly and with the minimum infection Treatment : Surgical Revascularization Limb Amputation (in life-threatening sepsis) Varieties of Gangrene : Diabetic Gangrene Bedsores(Local Pressure) Frostbite (exposure to cold)</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options :- Option: A & B.

Examination of the abdominal aorta is indicated if a popliteal aneurysm is found because one-third are accompanied by aortic dilatation. Popliteal aneurysms present as a swelling behind the knee or with symptoms caused by complications, such as severe ischemia following thrombosis or distal ischemia as a result of emboli. Diagnosis: Usually confirmed with duplex scanning but the assessment of the distal vessels (with CT, MR, or DSA) is important before repair if the foot pulses are diminished or absent. Treatment: Exclusion Bypass and Inlay Repair An asymptomatic aneurysm exceeding 20mm in diameter should be considered for elective repair, to prevent future complications. Some surgeons would also offer elective repair for smaller diameters if the sac contains a thrombus, because of a perceived increased risk of distal embolization. All symptomatic popliteal aneurysms, including those in which single crural vessel embolization has occurred, should be considered for repair.

Examination of the abdominal aorta is indicated if a popliteal aneurysm is found because one-third are accompanied by aortic dilatation. Popliteal aneurysms present as a swelling behind the knee or with symptoms caused by complications, such as severe ischemia following thrombosis or distal ischemia as a result of emboli. Diagnosis: Usually confirmed with duplex scanning but the assessment of the distal vessels (with CT, MR, or DSA) is important before repair if the foot pulses are diminished or absent. Treatment: Exclusion Bypass and Inlay Repair An asymptomatic aneurysm exceeding 20mm in diameter should be considered for elective repair, to prevent future complications. Some surgeons would also offer elective repair for smaller diameters if the sac contains a thrombus, because of a perceived increased risk of distal embolization. All symptomatic popliteal aneurysms, including those in which single crural vessel embolization has occurred, should be considered for repair.

Option: C. dependent rubor/sunset foot sign is present, mistaken for cellulitis Due to the dependant position foot may be red and swollen and thus mistaken for cellulitis by the unwary clinician Elevation of limb, pallor is present and again changes to red/purple color when hanged down -\u2013 sunset foot/dependant rubor sign</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Patients with chronic limb ischemia should be considered to have an imminently threatened leg and require urgent vascular assessment/revascularisation to prevent major amputation.
