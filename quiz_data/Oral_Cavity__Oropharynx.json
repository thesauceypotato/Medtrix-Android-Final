MRI is superior to CT in our experience and others, although some workers find MRI and CT comparable. For MRI, enhancement with gadolinium should be used to identify and delineate tumors accurately. Both imaging techniques demonstrate brain invasion on MRI and perineural spread. Sometimes, a magnetic resonance angiogram will help delineate extensive vessel involvement and assess patency.</p>\n<p></p>",
