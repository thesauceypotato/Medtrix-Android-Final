For DIPSS, the same is true, but anemia is assigned 2 points. The DIPSS Plus scoring system represents a recognition that the addition of unfavorable karyotype, thrombocytopenia, and transfusion dependence improved the DIPSS risk stratification system for which additional points are assigned (Table 103-5). More recent studies suggest that mutational analysis of the ASXL1, EZH2, SRSF2, and IDH1/2 genes further improves risk stratification for survival and leukemic transformation, as can cytogenetic abnormalities. These prognostic scoring systems are not accurate for risk assessment in polycythemia vera or essential thrombocytosis patients who have developed myelofibrosis.</p>\n<p></p>",

The factors responsible for marrow fibrosis are due to the elevation of TGF-B as well as PDGF. A major role is of increased TGF-B which results in obliteration of the bone marrow.
