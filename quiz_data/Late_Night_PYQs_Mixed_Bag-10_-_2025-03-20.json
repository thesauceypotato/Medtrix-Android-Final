The primary cause of pregnancy loss in APS is believed to be due to inhibition of trophoblast function and differentiation, which leads to placental dysfunction. The best management approach for pregnant women with APS includes: Low dose aspirin : Initiated as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Aspirin helps by preventing platelet aggregation and improving blood flow to the placenta. Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) : Started once fetal cardiac activity is detected. LMWH helps prevent blood clot formation, thus reducing the risk of thrombosis and improving pregnancy outcomes.</li><li>\u2022 Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent pregnancy loss, thrombosis, and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies.</li><li>\u2022 The primary cause of pregnancy loss in APS is believed to be due to inhibition of trophoblast function and differentiation, which leads to placental dysfunction.</li><li>\u2022 The best management approach for pregnant women with APS includes: Low dose aspirin : Initiated as soon as pregnancy is confirmed.

The goal of induction is to achieve vaginal delivery.</li><li>\u2022 achieve vaginal delivery.</li><li>\u2022 However, induction is contraindicated in situations where vaginal delivery is not possible or safe, as in central placenta previa, where the placenta completely covers the cervical os. Attempting vaginal delivery in this situation can lead to severe hemorrhage as contractions begin. Therefore, a cesarean section is indicated for central placenta previa to avoid the risk of bleeding and ensure the safety of both the mother and the fetus.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Oligohydramnios : Induction is indicated to avoid complications from low amniotic fluid.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Oligohydramnios</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

The spiral artery supplies blood to the endometrium. In normal pregnancy, there is an invasion of the extravillous trophoblasts (specifically, endovascular trophoblasts) into the walls of the spiral arteries. This process takes place in two waves: First wave (10-12 weeks): Endovascular trophoblasts invade up to the decidual segments. Second wave (16-18 weeks): Endovascular trophoblasts invade up to the myometrial segments. This invasion results in the distension of the spiral arterioles, transforming them into a low-resistance, low-pressure, and high-flow system. In preeclampsia, the failure of the second wave of endovascular trophoblastic invasion into uterine vessels leads to decreased placental perfusion.</li><li>\u2022 Preeclampsia occurs due to the failure of the invasion of extravillous trophoblasts into the spiral artery.</li><li>\u2022 The spiral artery supplies blood to the endometrium.
