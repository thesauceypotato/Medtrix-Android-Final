The factors responsible are: Chinese have a higher genetic susceptibility to nasopharyngeal cancer. Even after migration to other countries, they continue to have a higher incidence. Epstein\u2013Barr (EBV) virus is closely associated with nasopharyngeal cancer. Specific viral markers are being developed to screen people in high-incidence areas. EB virus has two important antigens: viral capsid antigen (VCA) and early antigen (EA). IgA antibodies of EA are particular for nasopharyngeal cancer but have a sensitivity of only 70\u201380%, while IgA antibodies of VCA are more sensitive but less specific. AgA antibodies against both EA and VCA should be done for screening patients for nasopharyngeal cancer. Environmental. Air pollution, smoking of tobacco and opium, nitrosamines from dry salted fish, and smoke from the burning of incense and wood have all been incriminated.</p>\n<p></p>",

Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head with contrast enhancement (CECT) is now the investigation of choice. It has replaced conventional radiographs.

Biopsy of the tumour is attended with profuse bleeding and is, therefore, avoided. If it is essential to differentiate it from other tumours, a biopsy can be done under general anaesthesia with all arrangements to control bleeding and transfuse blood. Option C. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) complements CT scans and shows any soft tissue extensions present intracranially in the infratemporal fossa or orbit. Option D. Carotid angiography shows the extent of tumours, their vascularity and feeding vessels mainly from the external carotid system. In very large tumours or those with intracranial extension, vessels may also come from the internal carotid system. Embolisation of vessels can be done at this time to decrease bleeding during the Feeders from only the external carotid system can be embolised. Resection of the tumour should not be delayed beyond 24\u201348 h of embolisation to avoid revascularisation from the contralateral side.</p>\n<p></p>",

Spontaneous regression of the tumour with the advancement of age, as thought previously, does not occur, and no wait-and-watch policy should be adopted. O ption C. Treatment with radiotherapy is controversial. Some believe all large tumours with intracranial extension should be treated with radiation, while others reserve it for recurrent inoperable tumours. Radiation to the nasopharynx in the young has the risk of developing malignancy at a later age. O ption D. Hormonal therapy. Since the tumour occurs in young males at puberty, probably activated by testosterone, hormonal therapy has been used as the primary or adjunctive treatment. Diethylstilbestrol and flutamide (an androgen blocker) have been used to arrest the growth, but no significant regression has been observed in practice.</p>\n<p></p>",
