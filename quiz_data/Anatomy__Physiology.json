The Bowman layer or membrane , the second layer, moving in towards the eye, serves as the smooth adhesion layer for the basement membrane of the epithelial cells.

It is particularly suitable for chronic unilateral disease, in which the prognosis for restoration of useful vision is poor. The buccal mucous membrane is an alternative. Amniotic membrane patch grafting can be used for persistent, unresponsive epithelial defects. Tissue adhesive like cyanoacrylate glue is used to seal small perforations. The glue can be applied to one side of a bespoke, trimmed patch of sterile plastic drape, which is pressed over the defect after the edges are dried with a cellulose sponge . The patch remains in place to seal the defect, and a bandage contact lens is inserted for comfort and to aid retention of the patch. Limbal stem cell transplantation may be used if there is a stem cell deficiency, as in chemical burns and cicatrizing conjunctivitis. The source of the donor tissue may be the fellow eye (autograft) in unilateral disease or a living or cadaver donor (allograft) when both eyes are affected. A newer technique involves the in vitro replication of the patient's own stem cells with subsequent reimplantation of the enhanced cell population.
