      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Montgomery T Tube The above image is of the Montgomery T tube.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Montgomery T tube The Montgomery T-tube is a silicone stent with a long central lumen and a smaller lumen projecting from the side of the stent at either a 90 or 75 angle. It is used to stent the larynx and trachea after reconstruction for areas of malacia and stenosis. It is a soft stent and can be left in place for periods over 12 months. Its main advantage is that the patient can speak. It is prone to crusting, and to counteract this, it is best to plug the side lumen as much as possible and intermittently perform proper suctioning to prevent blockage. It is not used in children under two years of age as the small size of the stent required has too narrow an internal diameter and can easily become blocked.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A.
