A rubber ball can be fixed to the back of the shirt to prevent adopting a supine position. Lifestyle change. Those with mild disease and minimal symptoms can be treated with weight loss and dietary changes, but those with cor pulmonale due to severe OSA may require surgery. The use of alcohol in the evening aggravates OSA. Sedatives/hypnotics taken at night also have the same effect. Smoking should be avoided. Reduction of weight is helpful. Intraoral devices. They alter the position of the mandible or tongue to open the retropalatal airway and relieve snoring and sleep apnoea. A mandible advancement device (MAD) keeps the mandible forward, while a tongue-retaining device (TRD) keeps the tongue in the anterior position during sleep. They help improve or abolish snoring. MAD is also helpful in retrognathic patients. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). It provides a pneumatic splint to the airway and increases its calibre.
