Physical examination reveals vital signs within normal limits except for a slight fever. Chest x-ray shows a small cavity in the right middle lobe and enlarged bronchopulmonary lymph nodes. Blood analysis reveals lymphocytosis and his sputum is positive for acid-fast bacilli. A treatment plan is discussed with the patient and he starts taking his medications. Which of these drugs acts by inhibiting the formation of mycolic acid?",

It thus enhances its own metabolism (area under the plasma concentration-time curve is reduced by ~35%) as well as that of many drugs. Contraceptive failures have occurred.

Abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A . Septran is a combination medicine that is used to treat various types of bacterial infections such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and infections of the urinary tract, ear, and abdomen. It prevents the growth of microorganisms to cure the infection. Option: C. Primidone is a prescription medicine used to treat and prevent epilepsy (seizures). However, it cannot cure epilepsy and will only work to prevent seizures for as long as you continue to take the medicine. Option: D . Phenytoin is a prescription medicine used to treat and prevent epilepsy (seizures). It controls seizures by decreasing the abnormal and excessive activity of the nerve cells in the brain.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is more active in an acidic medium and is highly lethal to intracellular bacilli as well as those present at sites of inflammation (pH is acidic at these sites). It is absorbed orally and has good penetration in CSF. It is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine. Hepatotoxicity is the most important dose-dependent adverse effect. Pyrazinamide may increase serum uric acid concentrations and decrease the efficacy of anti-gout therapy; dosage adjustments of these medications may be necessary to control hyperuricemia and gout when anti-gout medications are used concurrently with pyrazinamide.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A .
