About 20% of nephrotic syndrome are steroid- Mutations in several genes are known to cause steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome; among the implicated genes, NPHS2 appears to be the most common known form of inherited steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, accounting for about 45-55% of familial forms and 8-20% of sporadic forms of the disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The main features of nephrotic syndrome include: Proteinuria: Large amounts of protein (mainly albumin) leak into the urine due to damage to the glomeruli (the filtering units of the kidneys). Hypoalbuminemia: Loss of protein leads to low levels of albumin in the blood, causing a decrease in oncotic pressure and fluid accumulation in tissues (edema). Edema : The accumulation of fluid in various parts of the body, commonly noticed as swollen ankles, legs, and around the eyes (periorbital edema). Hyperlipidemia: There is an increase in blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels due to altered lipid metabolism. Hematuria : In some cases, red blood cells may also leak into the urine, causing hematuria (blood in the urine). Fatigue and malaise: Low albumin levels and fluid shifts can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of unwellness.</p>\n<p></p>",

The process of infection can further activate inflammatory pathways causing the release of various Proinflammatory biomarkers and histological changes consistent with an infectious intrauterine environment (chorioamnionitis) or umbilical cord (funisitis).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hydrocephalus is the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain's ventricles, causing increased intracranial pressure. It can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired later in life due to various factors. Symptoms include enlarged head size (in infants), headaches, vomiting, and cognitive issues. Diagnosis involves medical history, physical examination, and imaging tests (MRI or CT scans). Treatment options include shunt placement or endoscopic ventriculostomy. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for better outcomes.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Hydrocephalushas been divided into obstructive (also called non-communicating) or non-obstructive (also called communicating) hydrocephalus. Traditionally, obstruction to the Cerebrospinal Fluid flow within the ventricular system has been associated with obstructive or non-communicating hydrocephalus while impairment of circulation through the subarachnoid space (for example due to obliteration of subarachnoid cisterns) or defective absorption in the venous system has been associated with non-obstructive or communicating hydrocephalus. The aqueduct is the most common site of intraventricular blockade of Cerebrospinal Fluid flow; with causes of obstruction being congenital or acquired. Congenital aqueductal stenosis is one of the most common causes of o bstructive hydrocephalus in children. Infections such as mumps and toxoplasmosis are acquired causes of aqueductal stenosis in children and can also lead to obstructive hydrocephalus. Diagnosis should be made by measurement of head circumference (particularly in infants), USG (mainly when the anterior fontanelle is open), CT and MRI. Although CT can demonstrate ventricular dilatation, it may further be required to identify the nature of the obstruction, either functionally or anatomically. MRI is the best imaging modality to provide such functional and anatomic information. Two recent techniques for decompressing the ventricles are third ventriculostomy and cannulation of the aqueduct.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Some CNS complications of different infections Viral Enterovirus Hydrocephalus Varicella zoster Hydrocephalus, microcephaly, brain atrophy, porencephaly, hydranencephaly, calcifications, polymicrogyria, and focal lissencephaly secondary to necrotizing encephalitis Bacterial Syphilis Hydrocephalus Rubella Extensive cerebral cortical calcifications, microcephaly, subependymal cysts Parasitic Toxoplasmosis Diffuse calcifications in the basal ganglia, periventricular calcifications, progressive hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis</p>\n<p></p>",

Blockage of the passage out of the stomach due to thickening (hypertrophy) of the muscle at the junction between the stomach and the intestines.

Commonly seen in infants, typically between 2 to 8 weeks of age. Key clinical features include projectile, non-bilious vomiting, visible peristalsis (\"olive sign\") from left to right in the upper abdomen, and a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region. Prolonged vomiting can cause hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with associated hypokalemia due to loss of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and potassium (K+) from gastric contents. The diagnosis is confirmed by ultrasound imaging. Treatment usually involves surgical intervention with a pyloromyotomy to relieve the obstruction and restore normal gastric emptying.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Ultrasound shows thickened and lengthened pylorus.
