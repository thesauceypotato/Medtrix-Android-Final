The amyloid deposits in this condition are composed of \u03b22-Microglobulin (A\u03b22M). Normally filtered by the kidneys, \u03b22-microglobulin accumulates in patients with renal failure, especially during prolonged dialysis, as dialysis membranes are often inefficient at removing this protein. The deposition of A\u03b22M amyloid fibrils is particularly associated with osteoarticular structures, leading to symptoms like carpal tunnel syndrome and joint pain.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

This type of endocytosis is crucial for the uptake of nutrients, receptors, and other molecules. Clathrin, a protein, plays a key role by forming a coated pit that facilitates the invagination of the cell membrane and the formation of a vesicle that engulfs the extracellular material.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Pinocytosis : Though a form of endocytosis involving the ingestion of liquid, it does not specifically require clathrin. It generally involves smaller vesicles and can occur through clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent pathways.</li><li>\u2022 Option</li><li>\u2022 A. Pinocytosis</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Phagocytosis: Involves the ingestion of large particles and is generally not mediated by clathrin. It is typically performed by specialized cells such as macrophages and neutrophils.</li><li>\u2022 Option</li><li>\u2022 B. Phagocytosis:</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
