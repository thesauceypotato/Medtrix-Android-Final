      "text": "An 9-year-old girl is brought to the pediatric clinic by her parents, who are concerned about her recurrent complaints of feeling sick every morning on school days. She often becomes tearful and distressed before school and frequently visits the school nurse, reporting headaches and stomach pains. Her school attendance is affected, with her missing school or being picked up early by her mother at least once a week. A thorough evaluation by her pediatrician, including necessary investigations, has ruled out any organic causes for her symptoms. Interestingly, her parents report that she is usually symptom-free on weekends, but similar symptoms arise if her parents plan to go out and leave her with a babysitter. Based on this presentation, what is the most likely diagnosis for this child?",

It is characterized by a persistent and excessive fear of separation from prominent attachment figures (such as parents), which manifests in the form of reluctance to go to school, work, or away from home, or sleep in a separate room. If separation happens, the child may experience physical symptoms such as abdominal pain or headache and fear that something bad will happen to the attachment figures or to self. Treatment includes SSRIs and CBT.</li><li>\u27a4 Separation anxiety disorder</li><li>\u27a4 children and is comparatively less common in adolescents/adults</li><li>\u27a4 persistent and excessive fear of separation from prominent attachment figures</li><li>\u27a4 Ref : Kaplan & Sadock\u2019s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th edition, Page No 194-195.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref</li><li>\u27a4 : Kaplan & Sadock\u2019s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th edition, Page No 194-195.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
