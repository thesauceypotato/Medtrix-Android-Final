      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Chlorine Chlorine (choice B) is a halogen often used for microbial disinfection and antisepsis. Many compounds can release various forms of chlorine (OCl\u2212, HCl, Cl2) that can kill microorganisms by oxidation . These include sodium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, and sodium dichloroisocyanurate, oxidizing agents that destroy the cellular activity of proteins. Hypochlorous acid is the active ingredient for bactericidal and virucidal effects. Such compounds may be sporicidal. Iodine (I2) may also be bactericidal, fungicidal, tuberculocidal, virucidal, and sporicidal. Mercury is antimicrobial but dangerous to humans. Other options do not use oxidation as a mechanism. Ethanol (choice C) has limited killing ability for bacteria. Benzoic acid (choice A) has limited antimicrobial use, while ethylene oxide (choice D) can sterilize (completely kill all organisms) materials, but is very dangerous to humans as well.</p>\n<p></p>",

Biocide A chemical or physical agent, usually broad spectrum, that inactivates microorganisms Bactericidal A specific term referring to the property by which a biocide can kill bacteria. Bactericidal action differs from bacteriostasis only in being irreversible (ie, the \"killed\" organism can no longer reproduce even after being removed from contact with the agent). In some cases, the agent causes lysis (dissolution) of the cells; in other cases, the cells remain intact and may even continue to be metabolically active. (The terms fungicidal, sporicidal, and virucidal refer to the property whereby biocides can kill fungi, spores, and viruses, respectively.) Bacteriostatic A specific term referring to the property by which a biocide inhibits bacterial multiplication; upon removal of the agent, multiplication resumes. (The terms fungistatic and sporostatic refer to biocides that inhibit the growth of fungi and spores, respectively.) Septic Characterized by the presence of pathogenic microbes in living tissues or associated fluids. Aseptic Free of, or using methods to keep free of, microorganisms. Antiseptic An agent that destroys or inhibits the growth of microorganisms in or on living tissue or biologic fluids.
