Partial remission \u2013 A partial remission is a reduction in proteinuria of >50 percent, with absolute values between 300 mg and 3.5 g/day. Partial remission lasting more than two weeks is an unusual event in MCD, occurring in only 2 of 51 patients in one study. Furthermore, one can never be certain that such partial responders do not actually have focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) that was missed on kidney biopsy, since MCD is almost always an all-or-none disease Relapse \u2013 A relapse is a return of proteinuria to >3.5 g/day in patients who had previously undergone complete remission. A decrease in serum albumin level and the onset of edema usually follow within a few days. Frequently relapsing disease \u2013 Patients are considered frequent relapses if they have two or more relapses per six months (or four or more relapses per 12 months). Glucocorticoid-dependent disease \u2013 Glucocorticoid dependence refers to relapse occurring during, or within two weeks of completing, glucocorticoid therapy. Glucocorticoid-resistant disease \u2013 Glucocorticoid resistance refers to the persistence of proteinuria >3.5 g/day with \u226450 percent reduction from baseline after 16 weeks of adequate glucocorticoid therapy (ie, prednisone 1 mg/kg/day or 2 mg/kg every other day).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome with 2 or more relapses within 6 months: it is true regarding relapsing nephrotic syndrome.

Such patients have a poor prognosis without this therapy. In patients who have a high risk for glucocorticoid-induced toxicity (eg, patients with obesity, diabetes, severe osteoporosis, or age >70 years), a CNI (cyclosporine or tacrolimus), with or without low-dose glucocorticoids, is an alternative option for initial therapy. Patients who cannot be treated with either glucocorticoids or a CNI are rare. In such cases, alternative options might include mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), rituximab, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) gel, although there is no evidence to support the use of these agents as initial therapy.</p>\n<p></p>",
