However, within a week of discontinuing the treatment, the itching returned and the rash spread. She denies any new products or environmental exposures. Physical examination reveals poorly demarcated, erythematous plaques with slight scaling scattered over her face, as shown in the image below. There are no vesicles, pustules, or signs of systemic illness. What is the most likely diagnosis?(FMGE JULY 2023)",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. C) Tinea incognito</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Tinea incognito is a fungal infection that has been altered by the inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids. This condition often presents with atypical features compared to a classic dermatophyte infection. The history of initial improvement with a topical ointment (likely a corticosteroid) followed by a return and worsening of symptoms after discontinuation is characteristic of tinea incognito. The poorly demarcated erythematous plaques with slight scaling observed on physical examination support this diagnosis. The use of corticosteroids suppresses the inflammation and itching temporarily but allows the fungal infection to proliferate more aggressively once the treatment is stopped.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Tinea corporis : This typically presents with well-demarcated, annular, scaly plaques with central clearing and an active border, which is not the case here.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Tinea corporis</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Tinea cruris : Usually affects the groin area and is also characterized by well-demarcated borders and central clearing, which is not consistent with the facial distribution and poorly demarcated lesions observed here.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Tinea cruris</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Tinea capitis : This affects the scalp and hair, presenting with scaly patches, hair loss, and sometimes black dots.

C) Psoriatic Arthritis</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is characterized by joint pain and stiffness, which is often worse in the morning and improves with activity, indicating the presence of morning stiffness. The involvement of distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints is particularly notable in PsA and is a distinguishing feature. The presence of silvery, scaly plaques on the skin, especially on the extensor surfaces like elbows and knees, aligns with the diagnosis of psoriasis, a common comorbidity in PsA. Additionally, a positive family history for psoriasis strongly supports this diagnosis.</li><li>\u2022 The swelling observed in the DIP joints can be specifically referred to as dactylitis, which is a hallmark of PsA. This form of arthritis is also known as seronegative arthritis, meaning it is negative for rheumatoid factor, distinguishing it from rheumatoid arthritis. PsA is an erosive arthritis that can lead to joint damage if not properly managed.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Rheumatoid Arthritis : Typically involves the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints rather than the DIP joints. It is usually seropositive, meaning it often tests positive for rheumatoid factor. The skin lesions described are not characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Rheumatoid Arthritis</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Gout : Usually presents with acute onset of severe pain, redness, and swelling, often in the first metatarsophalangeal joint (big toe). It does not typically involve silvery, scaly plaques or have a family history of psoriasis.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Gout</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Ankylosing Spondylitis : Primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints rather than the peripheral joints like the DIP joints. It also does not present with psoriasis or skin plaques as described.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
