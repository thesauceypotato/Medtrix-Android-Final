This causes water to flow into the brain, leading to cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure.

This occurs due to reciprocal depression of serum calcium in response to hyperphosphatemia, which results from massive tumor cell breakdown and release of intracellular phosphate. The hypocalcemia can cause severe neuromuscular irritability and tetany.

Elevated potassium levels: Hyperkalemia is a hallmark finding in TLS. Potassium is the principal intracellular cation, and massive destruction of malignant cells leads to hyperkalemia.

Elevated potassium levels:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Elevated uric acid levels: Hyperuricemia is a characteristic finding of TLS.

These antibodies are highly specific, with >95% of patients having AMA directed against the PDC-E2 pattern.
