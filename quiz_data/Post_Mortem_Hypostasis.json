      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Capillo-venous distension from gravitational pooling of blood MECHANISM OF POST-MORTEM HYPOSTASIS Mechanism: The stoppage of circulation causes the stagnation of blood in blood vessels and its tendency to sink by the force of gravity. The blood tends to accumulate in the toneless capillaries and venules of the dependent parts of the body. The filling of these vessels produces a bluish-purple colour on the adjacent skin. The upper portions of the body drained of blood are pale. The intensity of the colour depends upon the amount of reduced haemoglobin in the blood. In cases of a large amount of reduced haemoglobin before death, the blood has deep purplish-red colour. The colour of the hypostasis may vary from area to area in the same body.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For incorrect Option:- Option: A, C & D. Since postmortem hypostasis occurs due to capillo-venous distention from the gravitational pooling of blood, other explanations in the options are irrelevant in this context.

Algor mortis- It\u2019s the process of cooling down a dead Option B.- Putrefaction is the last stage of decomposition, the destruction of tissues/body. 'The disintegration of body tissues after death is known as decomposition. The terms decomposition and putrefaction are used as synonyms. Putrefaction usually follows the disappearance of rigor mortis. During the hot season, it may commence before rigor mortis has wholly disappeared from the lower extremities. Organisms/bacteria gain entry into tissues mainly from the alimentary tract and also through the respiratory tract, and they multiply in tissues. As they multiply, the bacteria spread via vessels using proteins and carbohydrates of blood as culture media. They release bacterial enzymes. Option C. Cadaveric spasm- Cadaveric spasm (cataleptic rigidity) is a rare condition. In this, the muscles contracted during life become stiff and rigid immediately after death without passing into the stage of primary relaxation. As such, the change preserves the exact attitude of the person at the time of death for several hours afterwards. The spasm is primarily a vital phenomenon that originates from regular nervous stimulation of the muscles. This is usually limited to a single group of voluntary muscles and frequently involves the hands.</p>\n<p></p>",
