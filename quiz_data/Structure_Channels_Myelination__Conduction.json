Loss of myelin leads to leakage of through voltage-gated channels, hyperpolarization, and failure to conduct action potentials. Initial presentation commonly includes reports of paraparesis (weakness in lower extremities); paraesthesia; numbness; urinary incontinence; and heat intolerance (as already explained heat will prevent the propagation of action potential by reducing the Action Potential Duration). Clinical assessment often reports optic neuritis, characterized by blurred vision, a change in color perception, visual field defect (central scotoma), pain with eye movements; dysarthria; and dysphagia. Symptoms are often exacerbated by increased body temperature or increased ambient temper. Diagnosing MS is very difficult and generally is delayed until multiple episodes occur with deficits separated in time and space. Nerve conduction tests can detect slowed conduction in motor and sensory pathways. Cerebral spinal fluid analysis can detect the presence of oligoclonal bands indicative of an abnormal immune reaction against myelin. The most definitive assessment is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize multiple scarred (sclerotic) areas or plaques in the brain. These plaques often appear in the periventricular regions of the cerebral hemispheres.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Multiple sclerosis Autoimmune inflammation and demyelination of CNS (brain and spinal\n  cord) with subsequent axonal damage.

Preventing the inactivation of sodium channels by local anesthetics will decrease the upstroke velocity of nerve cell action potentials. Procaine reversibly and preferentially binds to active sites on neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels. This binding occurs preferentially during activated states and causes selective inhibition of the open configuration of the sodium channel, thereby preventing sodium influx. The interruption of this influx prevents depolarization needed to initiate and propagate action potentials along the nerve.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Local or regional anesthesia is used to block the conduction of action potentials in sensory and motor nerve fibers. This usually occurs as a result of the blockade of voltage-gated Na+ channels on the nerve cell membrane.

The relative refractory period is the interval of time during which a second action potential can be initiated, but initiation will require a greater stimulus than before.

Types Of Synapses:- Axodendritic synapse - Type I (most common) - Motor neurons of the spinal cord, excitatory synapse in the cerebral cortex, climbing fibers of the Axosomatic synapse - Type-ll (less common) - Motor neurons of the spinal cord, basket cells of the cerebellum, autonomic ganglia. Axoaxonic synapse (least common) - Seen in the spinal cord. Dendrodendritic synapse (rare) - seen in olfactory bulb between mitral and granule cells.</p>\n<p></p>",

Through synaptic transmission, an electrical signal in one neuron passes from the terminal of its axon into another cell and starts in that cell an impulse having characteristics different from its own. Chemical synapse is the correct answer because  In chemical synapses , the transmission of signals occurs through the release of neurotransmitters by the presynaptic neuron, which binds to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Chemical synapses have one exceedingly important characteristic that makes them highly desirable for transmitting nervous system signals. This characteristic is that they always transmit the signals in one direction\u2014that is, from the neuron that secretes the neurotransmitter, called the presynaptic neuron, to the neuron on which the transmitter acts, called the postsynaptic neuron. This phenomenon is the principle of one-way conduction at chemical synapses, and it is different from conduction through electrical synapses, which often transmit signals in either direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option B. In electrical synapses- There is no need for neurotransmitters to be released and received, so there is no synaptic delay. Additionally , electrical synapses allow for bidirectional signaling, meaning that signals can pass in both directions across the synapse . Option C. Inhibitory synapse - Are a subtype of chemical synapses where the neurotransmitter released by the presynaptic neuron inhibits the firing of the postsynaptic neuron. Inhibitory synapses, like excitatory synapses, rely on the release of neurotransmitters to signal across the synaptic cleft. However, in inhibitory synapses, the neurotransmitter binding to its receptor on the postsynaptic neuron results in a decrease in the postsynaptic neuron's activity, rather than an increase.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Main modalities of synaptic transmissions. \u00b7 a) Chemical synapse:- The arrival\nof action potential results in the activation of voltage \u2010 gated Ca \u207a channels, promoting the\nprobabilistic release of neurotransmitters by exocytosis from the presynaptic\nmembrane. The ionotropic and metabotropic receptors on the postsynaptic\nmembrane can detect and translate the information carried by neurotransmitters\ninto different postsynaptic behaviors, varying from changes in membrane\npotential to gene expression. \u00b7 b) Electrical synapse:- Electrical\ntransmission is conducted by gap junctions (some clusters of intercellular\nchannels) between two adjacent cells. The transmission is bidirectional: when\nan action potential is transmitted from pre \u2010 synapse to\npostsynapse, the postsynaptic resting potential propagates concurrently to the\npre \u2010 synapse. \u00b7 c) Mixed synapse:- Chemical\nand electrical transmission coexist at mixed synapses.

This principle is called the law of projection. Cortical stimulation experiments during neurosurgical procedures on conscious patients illustrate this phenomenon. For example, when the cortical receiving area for impulses from the left hand is stimulated, the patient reports sensation in the left hand, not in the head.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Between 50% and 80% of amputees experience phantom sensations, usually pain, in the region of their amputated limb. Phantom sensations may also occur after the removal of body parts other than the limbs. In patients who have had their leg amputated, single neuron recordings show that the thalamic region that once received input from the leg and foot now responds to stimulation of the stump (thigh). Others have demonstrated remapping of the somatosensory cortex. For example, in some individuals who have had an arm amputated, stroking different parts of the face can lead to the feeling of being touched in the area of the missing limb. Numerous theories have been evoked to explain this phenomenon. The current theory is based on evidence that the brain can reorganize if sensory input is cut off. The ventral posterior thalamic nucleus is one example where this change can occur. In patients who have had their leg amputated, single neuron recordings show that the thalamic region that once received input from the leg and foot now responds to stimulation of the stump (thigh). Others have demonstrated remapping of the somatosensory cortex. For example, in some individuals who have had an arm amputated, stroking different parts of the face can lead to the feeling of being touched in the area of the missing limb.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect Option:- Option A. The law states that the change in a stimulus that will be just noticeable is a constant ratio of the original stimulus. Option C.

The equilibrium potentials for chloride (\u201380 mV) and potassium (\u201392 mV) are close to the resting membrane potential, so increases in their permeability have little effect on the resting membrane potential. The equilibrium potential for sodium (+60 mV) is very far from the resting membrane potential. Thus, increasing the permeability of sodium causes a large depolarization.

If the membrane permeability to potassium increases, more potassium ions will leave the cell , causing hyperpolarization of the membrane potential towards the potassium equilibrium potential.
