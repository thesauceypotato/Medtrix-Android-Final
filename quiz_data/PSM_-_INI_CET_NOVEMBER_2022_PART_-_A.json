It complements disaster preparedness and response activities and includes measures taken to lessen the likely effects of emergencies. Some of these measures are: Flood mitigation Land-use planning Improved building codes Reduction and protection of vulnerable populations or structures. Disaster response includes activities such as rescue and first aid, field care, triage and tagging that form a part of the emergency care needed in the first few hours after a disaster. Disaster reconstruction is a part of the recovery phase after a disaster. Disaster rehabilitation refers to measures that lead to the restoration of pre-disaster conditions. These measures include water supply restoration, food safety, basic sanitation, personal hygiene, and vector control.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A & B.
