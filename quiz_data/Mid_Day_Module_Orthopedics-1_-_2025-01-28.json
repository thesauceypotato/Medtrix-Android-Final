Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I), also known as Von Gierke disease, is an inherited disorder caused by deficiencies of specific enzymes in the glycogen metabolism pathway. It comprises of 2 subtypes, GSD Ia and GSD Ib. In GSD Ia, there is a deficiency of enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, leading to hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. Patients with GSD 1b have normal G6Pase enzyme activity but have a deficiency of the transporter enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate translocase (G6PT), manifesting as hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis typically around 3 to 4 months of age. In suspected patients, genetic testing is the investigation of choice to confirm the diagnosis. Dietary treatment prevents hypoglycemia and improves the life expectancy of patients.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. von Gierke\u2019s disease</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Gordon\u2019s disease . Gordon Syndrome is a rare, inherited disorder that affects movement in the joints of the upper and lower limbs, also known as distal arthrogryposis. Patients can be born with several fingers fixed in a flexed position (camptodactyly), clubfoot, and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). Their joints are often very stiff or unable to move. Intelligence is usually normal. Gordon syndrome is caused by genetic mutations in the PIEZO2 gene and can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Gordon syndrome is diagnosed by clinical examination and genetic testing. Treatment is directed at the symptoms and includes surgery and physical therapy to loosen the joints.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

It peaks between 40 and 60 years for primary chondrosarcoma and between 25 and 45 years for secondary chondrosarcoma. Chondrosarcoma can occur in any location; however, most are located in a proximal location such as the pelvis (most common site) , proximal femur, and proximal humerus. Although chondrosarcomas rarely occur in the hand, they are the most common malignant tumor of bone in this location. The radiographic appearance of chondrosarcoma lesion arising in the medullary cavity with irregular matrix calcification. The pattern of calcification has been described as \u201c punctate \u201d, \u201c popcorn \u201d, or \u201c comma-shaped \u201d. Chondrosarcoma has a more aggressive appearance with bone destruction, cortical erosions, periosteal reaction, and rarely a soft-tissue mass.</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

Osteogenic sarcoma. Osteosarcoma is a tumor characterized by the production of osteoid matrix by malignant cells. It is the second most common primary malignancy of bone behind multiple myeloma. Onset can occur at any age; however, primary osteosarcoma occurs most commonly in the second decade of life. All skeletal locations can be affected; however, most primary osteosarcomas occur at the sites of the most rapid bone growth, including the distal femur, the proximal tibia, and the proximal humerus. Typical radiographic appearances include medullary and cortical bone destruction, permeative or moth-eaten appearance, aggressive periosteal reaction, sunburst appearance, Codman triangle.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

Osteoid sarcoma . Osteoid osteoma accounts for 10% of all benign bone tumors. It is neither locally aggressive nor does it have the potential for malignant transformation. This bone tumor frequently affects the long bones of the femur and tibia . It presents with a nidus of vascular osteoid with surrounding sclerotic bone. Osteoid osteomas in long bones are predominantly intracortical. Plain radiograph may be normal or may show a s olid periosteal reaction with cortical thickening. The nidus is sometimes visible as a well-circumscribed lucent region, occasionally with a central sclerotic dot. However, dense sclerosis may sometimes obscure the nidus.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

The radiographic features vary considerably, depending on the site of the lesion. In the skull, a round to oval osteolytic lesion is seen. The lesion have sharp borders, with a punched-out appearance . In the spine, the thoracic vertebrae are involved most often (54%), followed by lumbar (35%) and cervical (1 1%) vertebrae. The body of the vertebra is affected; the posterior elements are usually spared . Fractures of the vertebral bodies may cause marked compression, resulting in the characteristic vertebra plana or silver-coin appearance .

The flow cytometry markers positive in hairy cell leukemia include CD11c, CD25, CD103, and CD123, along with typical B-cell markers such as CD19, CD20, or CD22. The cyclin-d1 expression is usually present, but it is weak or focal. HCL-V is negative for CD25 and CD123. BRAF -mutation V600E is seen in nearly all cases of classic hairy cell leukemia. 80% patients have cytopenias on presentation. Splenomegaly is a predominant feature. Infectious complications are common, due to both the underlying immunosuppression from cytopenias and myelosuppressive therapy.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.
