Differential Diagnosis: Inguinal hernia Lymph node Saphena varix Femoral artery aneurysm Psoas abscess Rupture of adductor longus with hematoma Investigations: USG or CT (in cases of uncertainty) Treatment: There is no alternative to surgery for a femoral hernia and it is wise to treat such cases with some urgency Open approaches LOW APPROACH (LOCKWOOD) : This is the simplest operation for a femoral hernia but suitable only when there is no risk of bowel resection. It can easily be performed under local anesthesia. A transverse incision is made over the hernia. The sac of the hernia is opened and its contents are reduced. The sac is also reduced and non-absorbable sutures are placed between the inguinal ligament above and the fascia overlying the bone below. THE INGUINAL APPROACH (LOTHEISSEN) : The initial incision is identical to that of Bassini\u2019s or Lichtenstein\u2019s operation into the inguinal canal. The spermatic cord (or round ligament) is mobilized and the transversal fascia opened from the deep inguinal ring to the pubic tubercle. A femoral hernia lies immediately below this incision and can be reduced by a combination of pulling from above and pushing from below. If necessary, the peritoneum can be opened to help with reduction. Once reduced, the neck of the hernia is closed with sutures or a mesh plug, protecting the iliac vein throughout. HIGH APPROACH (McEVEDY) : This more complex operation is ideal in an emergency situation where the risk of bowel strangulation is high. It requires regional or general anesthesia. A horizontal incision (classically vertical) is made in the lower abdomen centered at the lateral edge of the rectus muscle. The anterior rectus sheath is incised and the rectus muscle is displaced medially. The surgeon proceeds deep into the muscle in the preperitoneal space. The femoral hernia is reduced and the sac is opened to allow careful inspection of the bowel, and a decision is made regarding the need for bowel resection. This is performed if necessary. In dubious cases, the bowel is replaced into the peritoneal cavity for 5 minutes and then re-examined. The femoral defect is then closed with sutures, mesh, or a plug.

The larger size of their inguinal canal, which transmitted the testicle and accommodates the structures of the spermatic cord, might be one of the reasons why men are 25 times more likely to have an inguinal hernia than women. Diagnosis : Clinical: Once reduced, the surgeon identifies the bony landmarks of the anterosuperior iliac spine and pubic tubercle, from which the location of the deep inguinal ring can be found just above the midpoint of the inguinal ligament. Gentle pressure is applied at this point and the patient asked to cough.

This area from lateral to medial includes the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, the femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve, and the femoral nerve , which runs on the surface of the psoas muscle and the iliac muscle. The femoral nerve is 6 cm above the inguinal ligament and is not easily injured because it is covered by the psoas muscle. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve runs just below the iliac fascia and enters the thigh in the 1- to 4-cm-wide region inferno\u2013medial to the anterior superior iliac spine under the ilio-pubic tract. Clinical data have shown that the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve and the femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve are more commonly damaged . Minor damage can result in abnormal sensations in the area innervated by these nerves. Such symptoms can resolve spontaneously in 2\u20134 weeks. However, these above-mentioned nerves can suffer major damage or entrapment when performing separation or fixation or when controlling bleeding, which may cause an abnormal sensation in the nerve-innervated area, especially chronic neuropathic pain, and may even cause motor disorders in the lower extremity.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair: Aim: To reduce the hernia and hernia sac from within the abdomen and place a 10 \u00d7 15 cm mesh (or larger) in the preperitoneal plane, just deep to the abdominal wall extending medially into the retropubic space and at least 5 cm lateral to the deep inguinal ring The mesh covers Hesselbach\u2019s triangle, the deep inguinal ring, and the femoral canal Types: TEP(Total Extraperitoneal) : In TEP, the surgeon develops the extraperitoneal plane just deep to the abdominal muscles, taking care not to enter the peritoneal cavity. TAPP (Transabdominal Preperitoneal) : In TAPP, the surgeon enters the peritoneal cavity first and incises the peritoneum above the hernia defect to open up the extraperitoneal space as in TEP. Advantages: Reduced pain Rapid Recovery Reduced incidence of wound complications such as infection, seromas, and bleeding. Limitations: Long Learning Curve Expensive</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B. The ilioinguinal nerve is a mixed nerve originating from the anterior rami of T12 and L1 nerve roots . It emerges near the lateral border of the psoas major muscle and goes inferior through the anterior abdominal wall, being sub-peritoneal and anterior to the quadratus lumborum muscle until it reaches the iliac crest. Symptoms of ilioinguinal nerve injury include: Burning or stabbing pain, numbness, or tingling in the lower abdomen and groin. Difficulty extending the back as this movement causes more pain . Option C. Genital branch of genitofemoral nerve : The genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve, also known as the external spermatic nerve in males, is a nerve in the abdomen that arises from the genitofemoral nerve. The genital branch supplies the cremaster muscle and anterior scrotal skin in males, and the skin of the mons pubis and labia majora in females. Damage to the nerve may present with scrotal pain in males, while females experience symptoms radiating to the labia majora and mons pubis . Option D. Obturator nerve : The obturator nerve is derived from L2-4 and travels along the medial border of the iliopsoas muscle; it is both a motor and a sensory nerve. It travels through the obturator foramen with the obturator artery and vein into the thigh. Patients with obturator nerve injury are usually present with hip adductor weakness and sensory deficits or neuropathic pain in the hip region . The known causes of obturator nerve damage include surgery, hemorrhage, tumor compression, and sports-related injuries.</p>\n<p></p>",

A high ligation of the proximal sac is recommended, and the stump is reduced deep underneath the internal ring.
