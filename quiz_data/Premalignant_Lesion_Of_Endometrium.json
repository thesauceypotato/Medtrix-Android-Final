If endometrial thickness is less than 4 mm, further testing may be deferred. But if there is a recurrence of bleeding, a tissue diagnosis is essential. Other factors to be assessed are the presence of a polypoidal endometrial mass or fluid collection as the latter may indicate pyometra. Endometrial Sampling This could be done by any of the following methods- Office endometrial aspiration biopsy Traditional fractional curettage Hysteroscopy and directed biopsy. Endometrial Aspiration Biopsy It is the IOC for endometrial cancer. Diagnostic accuracy: 92-98% Endometrial aspiration biopsy can be performed in the outpatient setting as it does not require any anesthesia and has the advantage of being simple, quick, safe, inexpensive, and convenient. It is combined with endocervical curettage to rule out cancer cervix. It is done using a vibra aspirator, Sharman curette, or Pipelle endometrial sampler (Fig. 14A.2). Fractional Curettage Fractional curettage is the Gold standard investigation used for ruling out endometrial cancer Here the endocervical canal is curreted first followed by dilation and endometrial curettage. Indications: Cervical stenosis; If clinical suspicion of malignancy is high; If bleeding recurs after a negative report on endometrial aspiration. Hysteroscopy and Biopsy It is not recommended routinely for endometrial cancer as most of the cancers are detected easily by endometrial aspiration biopsy and hysteroscopy is good for focal lesions. Pap Smear It is not a reliable test for diagnosis of Endometrial carcinoma. Only 30-50% of patients with endometrial carcinoma have positive pap tests and they are women with advanced disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option C: done if the sample shows atypia Option D: done if the sample doesn't show atypia Option B: indicated if malignancy is suspected</p>\n<p></p>",
