Volume loss greater than 20% or an unfavourable breast-to-tumour ratio requires an oncoplastic procedure to fill the defect so created by mobilising the breast tissue. Oncoplasty is defined as tumour excision with wide margins followed by repair of the defect by local rearrangement / replacement of the breast tissue and the nipple\u2013areola complex to maintain shape and symmetry.

High levels of serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen are produced . Calcitonin levels fall after resection and rise again with recurrence, making it a valuable tumour marker in the follow-up of patients with this disease. Diarrhea is a feature in 30% of cases and this may be due to 5-hydroxytryptamine or prostaglandins produced by the tumour cells. Medullary carcinoma may occur in combination with adrenal phaeochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism (usually due to hyperplasia) in the syndrome known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN-2A). The familial form of the disease frequently affects children and young adults, whereas the sporadic cases occur at any age with no sex predominance. The highest risk mutations are associated with early-onset disease and prophylactic total thyroidectomy is recommended during childhood.</li><li>\u27a4 Medullary thyroid cancers are tumours of the parafollicular (C cells) derived from the neural crest that are not unlike those of a carcinoid tumour.</li><li>\u27a4 parafollicular (C cells)</li><li>\u27a4 High levels of serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen are produced .
