Latanoprost has the best efficacy\u2013tolerability ratio of the PG analogs available for glaucoma treatment, and has good compliance and persistence. Thus, Latanoprost can be used in patients with glaucoma and concomitant bronchial asthma. In common with other prostaglandins, it lacks systemic effects, but can cause ocular adverse events such as conjunctival hyperemia, pigmentation of the iris, periocular skin or eyelashes, hypertrichosis, and ocular surface effects or irritation. Latanoprost is significantly better tolerated than either bimatoprost or travoprost.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B.

Type 1 reactions result from the activation of cell immunity, expressed clinically by exacerbation of skin and nerve trunk inflammation, leading to sensory and motor alterations. Type 2 reactions are acute inflammatory reactions with systemic involvement, entailing the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8. Treatment for RR aims to suppress the cellular immune response. Early diagnosis and the initiation of the anti-inflammatory therapeutic are essential in order to avoid possible nerve damage. Corticosteroids are the most efficient drugs used for RRs. They reduce intraneural and cutaneous edema, leading to quick improvement of symptoms, and they reduce post-inflammatory scarring. Their main effect is the suppression of the inflammatory immune response to Leprae antigens in skin and nerves, probably through interference with the activation of immune cellular response. For these reasons, immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids should be maintained for a long period of time. Importantly, polychemotherapy should be continued throughout the reactional episode, whether it be RR or ENL. There is a third type of reaction called neuritis, affecting the peripheral nerves, characterized by sudden pain or palpation of peripheral nerves, with or without thickening of nerve trunks.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Symptoms of Leprosy Skin lesions that may be faded/discolored Growths on the skin Thick, stiff or dry skin Severe pain Numbness on affected areas of the skin Muscle weakness or paralysis (especially in the hands and feet) Eye problems that may lead to blindness Enlarged nerves (especially those around the elbow and knee) A stuffy nose Nosebleeds Ulcers on the soles of feet POINTS ON MDT TREATMENT Every leprosy patient should receive tratment with more than one antileprosy drug Standard MDT is very safe and effective It is available free of charge for leprosy patients Standard MDT is for a fixed duration At the completion of a full course of MDT the patient is cured Use clinical criteria to classify and decide the treatment regimen If in doupt of classification, give MB treatment regimen Active follow-up after completion of treatment is not necessary In case of relapse, re-treat with appropriate standard MDT regimen</p>\n<p></p>",

Therefore, the use of NSAIDs in pain treatment for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is of particular concern. Acetaminophen lacks the anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulatory properties of the NSAIDs. Acetaminophen is thus a safe antipyretic and analgesic drug within the clinically recommended dosage range and has no effect on the progression of renal damage.

The major justification for the use of corticosteroids is the impending danger of blindness in untreated patients. Damage may be irreversible if treatment is delayed beyond 48 hours. Improvement of systemic symptoms (eg, headache, lethargy) typically occurs within 72 hours of initiation of therapy. The elevation in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and ischemic manifestations (eg, temporal headache, jaw claudication) diminish in several days. The ESR often drops even in patients with a normal baseline reading. High-dose steroid therapy should be maintained only long enough for symptoms to resolve; then be tapered slowly to the lowest dose required to suppress symptoms. The guidelines recommend that patients on steroid therapy receive prophylactic treatment with the following medications: Low-dose aspirin, 81 mg per day \u2013 To decrease cranial ischemic complications Proton pump inhibitor \u2013 For gastrointestinal protection Bisphosphonate, calcium, and vitamin D \u2013 For bone protection Alternative immunosuppressant agents (eg, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate) may be started later in the course of treatment as steroid-sparing agents in patients needing prolonged treatment with high doses of steroids (more than 5-10 mg/d) and with significant steroid-related complications.

Recently, many studies have focused on the adenosine-mediated antiinflammatory effects of methotrexate. However, mainly Methotrexate's mechanism of action is due to its inhibition of enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis including dihydrofolate reductase, thymidylate synthase, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide trans formylase (AICART), and amido phosphoribosyltransferase.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION B.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Drug clearance x target plasma concentration</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The volume of distribution (Vd) is a pharmacokinetic parameter representing an individual drug\u2019s propensity to either remain in the plasma or redistribute to other tissue compartments. By definition, Vd is a proportionality constant that relates the total amount of drug in the body to the plasma concentration of the drug at a given time. A drug with a highVd has a propensity to leave the plasma and enter the extravascular compartments of the body, meaning that a higher dose of a drug is required to achieve a given plasma concentration and vice versa. (High Vd -> More distribution to other tissue) from the clinical perspective, the single most important utility of Vd is calculating the loading dose of a drug . The loading dose is best calculated using the Vd at steady state (Vss) as it is the most representative of the specific drugs pharmacokinetic properties at desired steady-state plasma concentration. Therefore, the loading dose can be calculated using the following equation: Loading dose (mg) = [Cp (mg/L) x Vd (L)] / F Cp represents the desired plasma concentration of drug Vd represents the volume of distribution F represents the bioavailability of drug (IV administration = 1) After administration of a loading dose, additional maintenance doses can be administered to maintain the desired plasma concentration of the drug. Unlike, the loading dose, which is dependent on the drug's Vd, the maintenance dose is dependent on clearance (Cl). Maintenance dosing can be calculated with the following equation: Maintenance dose rate (mg/hr) = [Cp (mg/L) x Cl (L/hr)] / F Cp represents the desired plasma concentration of drug Cl represents the clearance rate of drug F represents the bioavailability of drug (IV administration = 1)</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Key differences between loading doses & maintenance doses include: The loading dose is contingent on the volume of distribution while maintenance doses are dependent on plasma clearance. The loading dose is only required for a few drugs in certain situations while maintenance doses are required for most drugs to maintain the steady-state plasma concentration. Loading doses are usually indicated in clinical scenarios where a drug needs to reach steady-state rapidly .

It is widely appreciated that both these agents increase the likelihood of bleeding: there is a popular conception that this risk is greater with warfarin. In fact, well-managed warfarin therapy (INR 2-3) has little effect on bleeding risk and is twice as effective as aspirin at preventing stroke. Patients with atrial fibrillation and a further risk factor for stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc >0) should therefore either receive warfarin or a novel oral agent.

Having a condition called atherosclerosis increases the risk of these types of clots. Option D.

DAPT should be continued for at least 1 year following stent placement to prevent stent thrombosis. After this period, aspirin should then be continued as the sole agent.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. PDE inhibitor is a vasodilating drug that works by blocking the degradative action of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) on cyclic GMP in the smooth muscle cells lining the blood vessels supplying various tissues Option B. Dabigatran is an anticoagulant used to treat and prevent blood clots and to prevent stroke in people with atrial fibrillation. Specifically it is used to prevent blood clots following hip or knee replacement and in those with a history of prior clots Option D. PDE3 inhibitor is a drug which inhibits the action of the phosphodiesterase enzyme PDE3.

For patients who have received clopidogrel and ASA, and require CABG: * Those at high risk of an early fatal event (eg, with refractory ischemia despite optimal medical treatment, and with high-risk coronary anatomy (eg, severe left main stenosis with severe right coronary artery disease), should be considered for early surgery without discontinuation of clopidogrel. * In patients with a high bleeding risk (eg, previous surgery, complex surgery) who are also at high risk for an ischemic event, consideration should be given to discontinuing clopidogrel for three to five days before surgery. * Patients at a lower risk for ischemic events (most patients) should have clopidogrel discontinued five days before surgery. For patients who have CABG within five days of receiving clopidogrel and ASA, the risk of major bleeding and transfusion can be minimized by applying multiple strategies before and during surgery. Patients who receive clopidogrel pre-CABG for a recent ACS indication should have clopidogrel restarted after surgery to decrease the risk of recurrent ACS. For patients with a recent coronary stent, the decision to continue clopidogrel until the time of surgery or to discontinue will depend on the risk and potential impact of stent thrombosis. Restarting clopidogrel after CABG will depend on whether the stented vessel was revascularized, the type of stent and the time from stent implantation. Clopidogrel should be restarted when hemostasis is assured to prevent recurrent acute ischemic events.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Phosphodiesterases superfamily (6,9) PDE FAMILY SUBSTRATE REGULATIONS INHIBITORS CLINICAL APPLICATIONS PDE 1 cAMP/cGMP Cazp/calmodulin activated Vinpocetine Nicardipine 8-MeOM-IBMX | Nimodipine Dementia, memory loss PDE 2 cAMP/cGMP Stimulated activated By cAMP Sepsis Acute respiratory Distress syndrome Memory loss PDE 3 cAMP/cGMP cAMP-inhibited Lixazinone Cilostamide Mirinone Cilostazol Dihydro-pyridazimone Glomerulonephritis Congestive heart failure Intermittent claudication Thrombosis Pulmonary hypertension PDE 4 cAMP cGMP-insensitive.

Aspirin produces its effects through inhibition of thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ) production, while P2Y 12 antagonists attenuate the secondary responses to ADP released by activated platelets. The anti-platelet effects of aspirin and a P2Y 12 antagonist are often considered to be separately additive. However, there is evidence of an overlap in effects, in that a high level of P2Y 12 receptor inhibition can blunt TXA 2 receptor signalling in platelets and reduce platelet production of TXA 2 . Against this background, the addition of aspirin, particularly at higher doses, could cause significant reductions in the production of prostanoids in other tissues, e.g. prostaglandin I 2 from the blood vessel wall.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

In patients with AIP, the function of porphobilinogen-deaminase is only 40-60% of normal. With the advent of molecular technique, it has become clear that the genetic defect is more common than symptomatic AIP. On average, out of 100 patients with the genetic defect, perhaps 10-20 secrete excess porphyrin precursors and only 1-2 have symptoms. The classic inducers of porphyria are chemicals or situations that boost heme synthesis. This includes fasting and many medications. Although very large lists of \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" drugs exist, many of these are based on anecdotes or laboratory evidence and do not meet strict criteria.
