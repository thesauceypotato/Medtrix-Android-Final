There may be intraperitoneal or broad ligament hematoma. Shock may be out of proportion to the blood loss. Release of thromboplastin into the maternal circulation results in DIC, or there may be amniotic fluid embolism. Blood coagulation disorders ( STATEMENT 1) Oliguria and anuria due to\u2014(a) hypovolemia, (b) serotonin liberated from the damaged uterine muscle producing renal ischemia, and (c) acute tubular necrosis. However, a severe case may lead to (d) cortical necrosis and renal failure. (STATEMENT 2) Postpartum hemorrhage due to \u2014 (a) atony of the uterus and (b) increase in serum FDP (STATEMENT 3) Puerperal sepsis.

In case of abruption: The short delivery interval is essential. Do not prolong this interval, as complications like DIC/Renal failure (acute cortical necrosis) can occur. Never give tocolytics in patients of abruption (no matter how tempted you may feel) The Pritchard rule for the management of abruption is to keep hematocrit at least 30% and maintain urine output-30ml at/hr Mode of Delivery Fetus living - Fetal distress present - LSCS -  No fetal distress and vaginal delivery is imminent - then vaginal delivery otherwise LSCS Fetus dead - Vaginal delivery is preferred unless hemorrhage is so severe that it cannot be managed even by vigorous blood replacement or there is the presence of some other obstetrical factor.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>DIC Release of thromboplastin in placental abruption leads to DIC in abruption M/c cause of DIC in obs is abruption.

Massively intravasation of blood into the uterine musculature up to the serous coat. The condition can only be diagnosed on laparotomy. Naked eye features: The uterus is of dark port wine color, which may be patchy or diffuse . It tends to occur initially on the cornu before spreading to other areas, especially over the placental site. Subperitoneal petechial hemorrhages are found under the uterine peritoneum and may extend into the broad ligament. There may be free blood in the peritoneal cavity or broad ligament hematoma. Microscopic appearance: The uterine muscles over the affected area are necrosed, infiltrating blood and fluid between the muscle bundles. Most of the muscular dissociation occurs in the middle and outer muscle layers. The serosa may occasionally split to allow the blood to enter the peritoneal cavity. The blood vessels show acute degenerative changes with thrombosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>VARIETIES (Figs 19.6A to D): Revealed: Following the separation of the placenta, the blood insinuates downwards between the membranes and the decidua. Ultimately, the blood comes out of the cervical canal to be visible externally. This is the most common type.

The presenting part prevents the accumulated blood from coming out of the cervix, which presses on the lower segment. Sometimes, the blood may percolate into the amniotic sac after rupturing the membranes. In any of the circumstances, blood is not visible outside. This type is rare.
