      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dopamine antagonist. This patient's combination of delusions for at least 6 months, as well as his pressured and disorganized speech indicates schizophrenia. His current difficulty walking and tremor following treatment suggest that he has developed extrapyramidal symptoms. Dopamine 2 receptor antagonism is the main mechanism of action for antipsychotics, especially first-generation antipsychotics such as haloperidol. All antipsychotics that interact with the D2 receptor can cause extrapyramidal syndrome, but this effect is particularly pronounced in the use of first-generation antipsychotics due to their high affinity to D2 receptors. Patients who have taken antipsychotics on the scale of days to weeks can show parkinsonism, including tremors, rigidity, and shuffling gait, which the patient in the vignette has. Management of EPS symptoms can be treated with an anticholinergic (e.g., benztropine), a dopamine agonist (e.g., amantadine), and reducing or omitting the offending drug.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Dopamine agonists, such as ropinirole and pramipexole, may be used in the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease (especially earlier disease).

Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are used to treat major depressive disorder. They would neither be indicated for schizophrenia nor cause EPS symptoms such as this patient's pseudo-parkinsonism. Option: D. Central-acting anticholinergic agents such as atropine can cause the following symptoms: confusion, agitation, thirst, skin flushing, and reactive pupils. Benztropine, an anticholinergic agent, would neither be indicated for schizophrenia nor cause EPS symptoms such as this patient's pseudo-parkinsonism.</p>\n<p></p>",

Neutralization of gastric acid is the mechanism of action of antacids such as calcium carbonate. These agents are commonly used for mild, intermittent heartburn, and/or GERD. However, this patient has severe symptoms and is unlikely to experience long-term improvement with antacids alone. Option: D. Enhancement of the mucosal barrier in the stomach and duodenum is the mechanism of action of sucralfate, which forms a protective barrier, acts as an acid buffer, and promotes HCO3 production.

Since the half-life of amiodarone is extremely long, only a negligible amount of the drug would be eliminated from the body after 20 minutes, meaning that the total drug amount in the body after this time would approximately be equivalent to the amount of the drug administered. In this case, the total drug amount is 150 mg (150,000 \u03bcg) and the plasma concentration is 2.5 \u03bcg/mL. Therefore, Vd = 150,000/2.5 = 60,000 mL (60 L). The volume of distribution represents the tendency of a drug to be distributed in body tissue rather than plasma.
