They also supply the dilator pupillae.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>CILIARY GANGLION The ciliary ganglion is a peripheral parasympathetic ganglion placed in the course of the oculomotor nerve. It lies near the apex of the orbit between the optic nerve and the tendon of the lateral rectus muscle. It has parasympathetic, sensory, and sympathetic roots. The parasympathetic root arises from the nerve to the inferior oblique. It contains preganglionic fibers that begin in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus. The fibers relay in the ciliary ganglion. Postganglionic fibers arising in the ganglion pass through the short ciliary nerves and supply the sphincter pupillae and the ciliary The sensory root comes from the nasociliary nerve.

Connections of ciliary ganglion</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Oculomotor Nerve Oculomotor function Motor The oculomotor nerves send somatic motor fibers to all extraocular muscles, except the superior oblique and lateral rectus. The superior branch supplies the superior rectus which elevates the eyeball, and the levator palpebrae superioris which raises the upper eyelid. The inferior branch innervates the medial rectus which adducts the eyeball, the inferior rectus which depresses the eyeball, and the inferior oblique which elevates, abducts, and laterally rotates the eyeball. Parasympathetic There are two primary functions of the autonomic parasympathetic (involuntary) oculomotor nerve. It constricts the pupil (miosis) by innervating the smooth muscle (sphincter pupillae) near the pupil. It also innervates the ciliary muscles. The sphincter pupillae causes the narrowing of the pupil in order to prevent diverging light rays from the corneal periphery creating a blurred image. The ciliary muscle changes the shape of the lens during accommodation. Sympathetic The oculomotor nerve has no direct function, but sympathetic fibers run with the oculomotor nerve to innervate the superior tarsal muscle (helps to raise the eyelid). Option B. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the otic ganglion Postganglionic sympathetic fibers from otic ganglion send sympathetic vasomotor fibers to the parotid gland. Option C. Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from Edinger Westphal nucleus The Edinger-Westphal nucleus contains a group of parasympathetic preganglionic cells that innervate the ciliary muscle and the pupillary constrictor.
