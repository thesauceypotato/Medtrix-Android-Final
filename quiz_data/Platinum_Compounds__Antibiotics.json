      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Azathioprine The patient must be on a long-term immunosuppressant to decrease the risk of organ rejection after her kidney transplant. Azathioprine is used to reduce the risk of acute graft rejection after kidney transplantation and to treat autoimmune disorders such as glomerulonephritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It interferes with purine nucleotide (adenine, guanine) synthesis and hence DNA synthesis and repair. In the body, hepatic metabolism converts azathioprine to 6-mercaptopurine; the two drugs, therefore, have the same mechanism of action.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option:A. is not correct: 5-Fiuorouracil is a pyrimidine antimetabolite used to treat many cancers, including colon cancer, breast cancer, and basal cell carcinoma of the skin. It inhibits DNA synthesis by interfering with methylation and by inhibiting thymidylate synthetase. 5-Fiuorouracil is not used in long-term immunosuppressive therapy regimens. Option:C. is not correct: Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that has immunosuppressive activity. Cyclophosphamide causes cross-linkage formation in DNA. It is used to treat many different cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, and lung cancer. It is also used to prevent rejection in transplant recipients and in the treatment of autoimmune disorders such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Because it is extremely toxic, cyclophosphamide is replaced by less toxic drugs as soon as possible following control of the disease, thus making it inappropriate for long-term immunosuppression. Option:D. is not correct: Cytarabine is a cytosine (pyrimidine) analog that is ingested in a prodrug form and is activated by the liver to azacytidine triphosphate (AraCTP). AraCTP then acts as the cytosine analog and interferes with DNA synthesis. It is primarily used to treat acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and meningeal leukemia. It is not used for long-term immunosuppression after renal transplantation.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Conversion of testosterone to estradiol Exemestane is an aromatase inhibitor , preventing the conversion of testosterone to estradiol and androstenedione to estrone. It works by forming an irreversible bond with aromatase. Two nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors are anastrozole and letrozole, which inhibit aromatase via reversible competition. It is used to treat postmenopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer. It is often used after 2-3 years of tamoxifen treatment, or in patients who have hormone-responsive breast cancer that advances despite tamoxifen treatment. Unlike premenopausal women, for whom estrogen is predominantly synthesized in the ovary, estrogen in postmenopausal women is largely derived from the adrenal gland, where aromatase converts androgens to estrogen</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. is not correct: Conversion of androstenedione to testosterone is facilitated by 1713-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. It is produced in the adrenal glands and gonads. Option: B . is not correct: Conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone is facilitated by Sa-reductase. Aromatase, however, converts testosterone into estradiol. Sa-Reductase is produced in men, specifically in the prostate, epididymis, seminal vesicles, and skin. Finasteride, an inhibitor of this enzyme, is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer, and male pattern baldness. Dutasteride is another drug in its class that is used to treat BPH. Inhibition of this enzyme may increase the levels of estradiol. Option: D. is not correct: Gonadotropic-releasing hormone (GnRH) acts to promote the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland. Leuprolide, a GnRH agonist, can be used to treat hormone-responsive prostate or breast cancer. Leuprolide constantly stimulates GnRH receptors, which results in an initial flare of FSH and LH release. However, intermittent pulses of GnRH activity are necessary to maintain proper secretion of these hormones, and their release is soon downregulated.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Testosterone has many beneficial effects, including increasing bone strength and density, inducing hematopoiesis, driving sexual function and libido, providing a cardioprotective effect and increasing muscle strength.</p>\n<p></p>",

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can recognize and destroy cancer cells. However, an inhibitory mechanism interrupts this destruction. Ipilimumab turns off this inhibitory mechanism and allows CTLs to function. Ipilimumab was approved for the treatment of melanoma, a type of skin cancer. It is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), bladder cancer,, and metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Option: A . Pembrolizumab is a humanized antibody used in cancer immunotherapy. It targets the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor.
