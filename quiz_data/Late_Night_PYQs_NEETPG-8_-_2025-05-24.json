Placement Check : An index finger is directed into the posterior vaginal fornix to ensure the cervix is above the pessary, and the pessary should fit snugly against the vaginal walls without causing pain. Adequacy Check : The patient is asked to perform a Valsalva maneuver (forceful exhalation against a closed airway) to see if the pessary remains in place, ensuring it is not dislodged during increased intra-abdominal pressure.
