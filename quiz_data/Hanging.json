      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Homicidal Hanging HOMICIDAL HANGING: It is extremely rare. It is difficult for a single assailant to carry it out unless the victim becomes unconscious by injury or by a drug, is taken unaware, or is a child or a very weak person. Homicide should be suspected. Where there are signs of violence or disorder of furniture or other objects, Where the clothing of the deceased is torn or disarranged Where there are injuries, either offensive or defensive. In all doubtful cases, circumstantial evidence is essential. If an individual is suspended upside down for a long time, death can occur in a few hours to a day from acute cardiac or respiratory failure or a combination of both.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. SUICIDAL HANGING - A typical method of self-suspension is to attach a rope to a high point, such as a beam, window-casing, ceiling fan, a branch of a tree, etc. The lower end is formed into either a fixed loop or a slip-knot placed around the neck. The victim stands on a stool, chair or other platform and jumps off or kicks away the support, due to which the body is suspended. The body must be in a position compatible with self-suspension. Option: B. ACCIDENTAL HANGING : It is seen in children during play while imitating judicial hanging. Some padding between the ligature and neck suggests an accident. Workmen falling from scaffolding may be hanged by becoming entangled in ropes. When boys climb trees or railings, they may lose their foothold, and in falling, some garment is caught by a branch of a tree or bar and is drawn tight around the neck. Infants wearing restraining apparatus may wriggle partly out of it and become asphyxiated by its tightening around their neck as they try to crawl away or fall over the side of the bed. The ligature need not completely encircle the neck to cause death. It is sufficient if applied beneath the chin to compress the sides of the neck, e.g., suspension of the chin by the steering wheel of a motor car, the tailboard of a lorry or cart, the edge of a sofa or the arm of the chair. A person who slips when descending a ladder may be suspended by one of its rungs, or a slip on a staircase may result in suspension on the edge of one of the treads. It may be associated with abnormal sexual behaviour. Option D: Postmortem Hanging : A person may be murdered, and the dead body suspended to simulate suicide. A ligature applied to the neck within two hours of death will produce a ligature mark.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hanging In hanging cases, the hyoid bone is forced directly backwards, due to which the divergence of greater horns is increased, which may fracture with the outward displacement of the posterior small fragment. In such cases, the periosteum is only torn on the inner side of the fracture so that the fragment can be easily moved outwards. Still, the inward movement is limited to the normal position only. Like the inward compression fracture, anteroposterior compression fracture may occur either in the greater horn or at its junction with the body, which may be bilateral. When compression is severe, the small fragment may completely detach from the bone and lie either medially or laterally to the rest of the bone.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Options: B, C & D: Hyoid fracture is not common in strangulation, choking or throttling.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Antero-posterior compression Anteroposterior Compression Fractures are usually seen in cases of hanging, The hyoid bone is forced directly backwards, so the divergence of greater horns is increased, which may fracture with the outward displacement of the posterior small fragment.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. In such cases, the periosteum is only torn on the inner side of the fracture so that the fragment can be easily moved outwards. Still, the inward movement is limited to the normal position only. Option: C. Like the inward compression fracture, anteroposterior compression fracture may occur either in the greater horn or at its junction with the body, which may be bilateral. When compression is severe, the small fragment may completely detach from the bone and lie either medially or laterally to the rest of the bone. In such cases, in situ examination of the hyoid bone in the neck only will decide whether the fracture was inward or outward. Outward fractures of the greater horn of the hyoid bone are seen in ligature strangulations, run-over motor vehicle accidents blow on the front of the neck, etc. In these cases, the hyoid bone is grossly fractured with an outward displacement of the fragments and multiple fractures of other structures are also found.</p>\n<p></p>",
