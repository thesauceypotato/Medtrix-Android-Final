      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>III The third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves innervate the extraocular muscles that position the globes in the orbits. Extraocular muscle paralysis resulting from lesions in one or all of these cranial nerves results in the failure of one or both eyes to rotate in concert with the other eye. The primary symptom is diplopia caused by misalignment of the visual axes, and the pattern of Image separation is the key to diagnosing which particular ocular motor cranial nerve (and extraocular muscle) is involved. With unilateral third cranial nerve palsy (ie, oculomotor nerve palsy) , the involved eye usually is deviated \"down and out\" (ie, infraducted and abducted ), and there may be partial or complete ptosis . In addition, pupillary dilatation can cause anisocoria (greater in the light), symptomatic glare in bright light, and accommodation deficit that may cause blurred vision for near objects. A painful pupil-involved oculomotor nerve palsy may result from a life-threatening intracranial aneurysm. Therefore, recognition of oculomotor nerve palsy is critical to ensure prompt and appropriate evaluation and treatment. The 3rd cranial nerve palsies can be seen in both nuclear and Fascicular lesions.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Paralysis of the third nerve In complete paralysis of the third nerve, there is ptosis, which prevents diplopia .

The clinical presentation of the patient points towards the diagnosis of cavernous sinus thrombosis which can involve the 6th nerve, as it passes from the inside of the cavernous sinus .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Cavernous sinus thrombosis is usually caused by a bacterial infection that spreads from another area of the face or skull. Many cases are the result of an infection of staphylococcal (staph) bacteria, which can cause: sinusitis \u2013 an infection of the small cavities behind the cheekbones and forehead. Septic CST most commonly results from contiguous spread of infection from a nasal furuncle (50%), sphenoidal or ethmoidal sinuses (30%) and dental infections (10%). Less common primary sites of infection include the tonsils, soft palate, middle ear, or orbit (orbital cellulitis). Staphylococcus aureus is the most common infectious microbe, found in 70% of the cases. Streptococcus is the second leading cause. Gram-negative rods and anaerobes may also lead to cavernous sinus thrombosis. Rarely, Aspergillus fumigatus and mucormycosis cause CST. Aseptic cavernous sinus thrombosis is much less common and is usually associated with other disorders including trauma, circulatory problems, nasopharynx cancers and other tumours of the skull base, dehydration, and anaemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.

Aneurysms. Hence the correct answer is option C. In compressive third-nerve palsy , the pupil becomes fixed and dilated due to paralysis of the sphincter pupillae . Ciliary muscle paralysis also leads to loss of accommodation. However, in ischemic lesions, the pupil is spared, and there is no loss of accommodation . The sparing of the pupil is thought to be associated with the micro fasciculation of the fibres that control the pupillomotor function located on the outermost aspect of the oculomotor nerve fibres ; these fibres are spared because they are outermost and therefore less prone to ischemic damage than is the innermost. The most common cause of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy is microvascular infarction which is caused as a result of diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and collagen vascular disease and is pupil-sparing</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.
