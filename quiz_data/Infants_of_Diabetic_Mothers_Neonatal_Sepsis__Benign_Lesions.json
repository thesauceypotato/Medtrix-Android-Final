If repeat blood glucose is more than 40 mg/ dl, frequent feeding is ensured with 6 hourly monitoring of blood sugar for 48 hours. However, if blood sugar values persist below 40 mg/dl, the baby should receive an IV glucose infusion On the other hand, if initial blood glucose in an asymptomatic baby is less than 20 mg/dl, IV glucose is recommended All symptomatic neonates with hypoglycemia should receive IV glucose.</p>\n<p></p>",

When the mother is diabetic, the high blood glucose in the mother gets transferred through the placenta and causes a hyperinsulinemic state in the fetus. Insulin is an anabolic hormone which causes rapid growth of the fetus. The most common congenital heart disease in infants of diabetic mothers is Ventricular septal defect (VSD), but Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is the most specific cardiac anomaly and Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the least common. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy characterized by the thickening of the interventricular septum / ventricular walls occurs more commonly in infants of mothers who are having pregestational diabetes mellitus.</p>\n<p></p>",
