This constriction forms a fibrous band that progressively tightens around the digit, leading to necrosis and eventual spontaneous auto-amputation. This condition is most commonly seen in individuals who have a history of running barefoot during childhood. The pathogenesis includes the development of a fissure at the interphalangeal joint, which deepens over time and involves tendons, nerves, and blood vessels, eventually leading to bone separation without bleeding.</li><li>\u2022 Characteristics of Ainhum:</li><li>\u2022 Characteristics of Ainhum:</li><li>\u2022 Most commonly affects the base of the fifth toe Can occasionally affect other toes Common in males and individuals of African descent Often bilateral Progressive stages from grooving pain to auto-amputation</li><li>\u2022 Most commonly affects the base of the fifth toe</li><li>\u2022 Can occasionally affect other toes</li><li>\u2022 Common in males and individuals of African descent</li><li>\u2022 Often bilateral</li><li>\u2022 Progressive stages from grooving pain to auto-amputation</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces an excessive amount of thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). In a thyroid storm, these hormone levels become dangerously elevated, leading to a wide range of symptoms and complications.</li><li>\u27a4 Symptoms of a thyroid storm may include:</li><li>\u27a4 High fever Rapid and irregular heartbeat (tachycardia) Elevated blood pressure Extreme agitation and restlessness Profuse sweating Tremors and shaking Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea Delirium or confusion Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) Coma (in severe cases)</li><li>\u27a4 High fever</li><li>\u27a4 Rapid and irregular heartbeat (tachycardia)</li><li>\u27a4 Elevated blood pressure</li><li>\u27a4 Extreme agitation and restlessness</li><li>\u27a4 Profuse sweating</li><li>\u27a4 Tremors and shaking</li><li>\u27a4 Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea</li><li>\u27a4 Delirium or confusion</li><li>\u27a4 Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)</li><li>\u27a4 Coma (in severe cases)</li><li>\u27a4 Thyroid storms can be triggered by various factors, such as surgery, infection, trauma, or medication changes in individuals with underlying hyperthyroidism.

Associated anomalies occur in about 20% of cases and include cardiac lesions, polysplenia, situs inversus, absent vena cava, and a preduodenal portal vein.</li><li>\u27a4 Portoenterostomy, also known as the Kasai procedure, is a surgical treatment for a condition called biliary atresia. Biliary atresia is a rare and serious liver disease that affects neonates. In this condition, the bile ducts (intra/extrahepatic) are obliterated at birth.</li><li>\u27a4 The Portoenterostomy procedure involves the surgical creation of a new pathway for bile to flow from the liver into the small intestine. This is done by connecting a loop of the jejunum directly to the liver, allowing bile to bypass the blocked or absent bile ducts. The goal of the procedure is to restore bile flow and prevent liver damage, as untreated biliary atresia can lead to liver failure. Ideal management of high grades of biliary atresia (Kasai type 3) is liver transplant.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
