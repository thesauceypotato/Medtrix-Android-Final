The mother also reports that the child has gingival hyperplasia. Following a complete blood count (CBC), the results reveal anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis with 75% blast cells, leading to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Considering the specific symptom of gingival hyperplasia alongside the AML diagnosis, which subtype of AML is this child most likely to have?",

Upon examination, the pediatrician notes severe anemia, splenomegaly, and jaundice. The mother mentions a vague family history of a \"blood problem\" but lacks specific details. Due to the complexity of the case, the child is referred to a hematologist for a more thorough evaluation. Hemoglobin electrophoresis results come back normal, but the CBC shows normocytic anemia, and the peripheral smear reveals the presence of bizarre erythrocytes, including spiculated cells. These findings suggest that the child's anemia may be due to an enzyme deficiency. Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, what is the most common enzyme deficiency that could result in this type of anemia?",
