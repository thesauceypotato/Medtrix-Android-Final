HLA DR3/DR4 haplotype: The presence of the HLA DR3 and DR4 haplotypes is associated with an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. Option: B. Polymorphism for CTLA4 and PTPN22: Polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins such as CTLA4 and PTPN22 have been implicated in the development of type 1 diabetes. These genetic variations can affect immune system regulation and increase the risk of autoimmunity. Option: C. Insulin with VNTR: Insulin gene VNTR polymorphism has been studied in relation to type 1 diabetes susceptibility.
