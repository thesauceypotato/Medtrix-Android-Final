An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Tocilizumab: Mab against IL-6 is FDA-approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis It can be given IV and subcutaneous</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Castleman\u2019s disease : The two primary types are unicentric Castleman disease and multicentric Castleman disease. The condition affects your lymph system and causes symptoms similar to the flu. Castleman disease refers to a group of rare disorders that involve a hyperactive immune system. Option: C . Systemic scleroderma is an autoimmune rheumatic disease characterised by excessive production and accumulation of collagen, called fibrosis, in the skin and internal organs and by injuries to small arteries. There are two major subgroups of systemic sclerosis based on the extent of the skin. Option: D . Gout is a common and complex form of arthritis that can affect anyone. It's characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness and tenderness in one or more joints, most often in the big toe. An attack of gout can occur suddenly, often waking you up in the middle of the night with the sensation.</p>\n<p></p>",
