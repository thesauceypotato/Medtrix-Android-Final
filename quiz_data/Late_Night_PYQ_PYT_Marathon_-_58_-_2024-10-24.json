Lordosis</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Lordosis refers to the inward (anterior) curvature of the spine. It's the normal anatomical curvature seen in the lumbar (lower back) and cervical (neck) regions. In the lumbar region, lordosis allows for an upright posture and helps to evenly distribute the body's weight and the forces exerted on the spine. While a certain degree of lumbar lordosis is normal and healthy, excessive lordosis (often called \"swayback\") can lead to pain and other issues.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Scoliosis: Scoliosis refers to a lateral (side-to-side) curvature of the spine. While any part of the spine can be affected, scoliosis most commonly develops in the thoracic (upper/mid back) and/or lumbar (lower back) regions. It's important to note that while scoliosis can affect the lumbar spine, it is not the normal anatomical curvature for that region. Instead, it's a pathological condition which can be idiopathic (most common, especially in adolescents), congenital, or secondary to other conditions.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Scoliosis:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Kyphosis: Kyphosis describes a forward (anterior) rounding or curvature of the spine, producing a \"hunchback\" appearance. The normal anatomical region that displays kyphosis is the thoracic spine (upper/mid back). When present in the lumbar spine, it is considered pathological and is usually secondary to conditions like osteoporosis (which causes compression fractures), degenerative diseases, or other spine disorders.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Kyphosis:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Recurvatum: Recurvatum typically refers to a backward bending or hyperextension of a joint. While this term can be applied to various joints in the body, it's most commonly associated with the knee joint, where the knee bends backward excessively. It doesn't directly pertain to the natural anatomical curvatures of the spine.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
