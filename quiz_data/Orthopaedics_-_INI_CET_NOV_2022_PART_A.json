      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Equinus,inversion,forefoot adduction,cavus CTEV is a congenital malformation of the foot. Predominantly seen in male children. In congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV), or clubfoot, the deformity is equinus, inversion, forefoot adduction, and cavus. Components of deformity Cavus - This deformity occurs due to exaggerated arching of the foot at the midtarsal joint. Adduction - This deformity occurs at the talonavicular joint. Inversion - This deformity occurs at the subtalar joint. The calcaneum is inverted, and along with it, the whole foot is inverted. This leads to a medially facing sole. Equinus - This deformity occurs at the ankle joint and tarsal joints.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Ponseti Method : Should begin as early as 2 weeks The order of correction according to Ponseti's method is cavus-adduction-varus-equinus (CAVE) . Weekly manipulation of the foot is done with the help of plaster casts. First metatarsal is elevated to correct the cavus , creating a flat longitudinal medial border of the foot. Then the forefoot is abducted in the plane of the metatarsals , everts the hindfoot and corrects the forefoot out of supination. Finally, the equinus is corrected by dorsiflexing the foot at the ankle joint . A percutaneous Achilles' tenotomy is required later for complete correction of the equinus deformity. In addition to the above procedure, the child can be provided with CTEV shoes once the child starts walking to retain correction.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA AGE WISE MANAGEMENT OF CTEV Initial treatment starts with Ponseti's POP cast as early as possible,but within 1 year of age.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Osteoclastoma The given clinical scenario and the x-ray showing a lytic lesion at the end of a long bone with a soap-bubble appearance suggest a giant cell tumor (GCT)/ osteoclastoma. Osteoclastoma usually affects young adults of age 20 to 40 years with slight female predominance. It is a benign but locally aggressive tumor. It is exclusively seen in adults and affects the ends of long bones, involving metaphysis/ epiphysis of long bones. GCT is most commonly seen in the distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus, and distal radius. Common presenting complaints are swelling and vague pain. Sometimes, the patient presents for the first time with a pathological fracture through the lesion. Important x-ray features of a GCT: A solitary, possibly loculated, lytic lesion in the epiphysis. Eccentric location, most often subchondral. Expansion of the overlying cortex. Soap bubble appearance - The tumor is homogeneously lytic with trabeculae of the remnants of bone traversing it, giving it a loculated appearance called soap bubble appearance. No calcification within the tumor. No or minimal reactive sclerosis around the tumor</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA RADIOLOGICAL APPEARANCE TUMORS SUNRAY APPEARANCE /CODMAN\u2019S TRIANGLE OSTEOSARCOMA BUT CAN BE SEEN IN ANY MALIGNANT CONDITION SOAP BUBBLE APPEARANCE GIANT CELL TUMOR ONION PEEL APPEARANCE EWING\u2019S SARCOMA BUT CAN BE SEEN IN ANY MALIGNANT TUMOR GROUND GLASS APPEARANCE/ SHEPHERDS CROOK DEFORMITY FIBROUS DYSPLASIA HOMOGENOUS CALCIFICATION OSTEOGENIC TUMORS FALLEN FRAGMENT SIGN/TRAP DOOR SIGN SIMPLE BONE CYST POLKA DOT SIGN VERTEBRAL HEMANGIOMA MOTH EATEN BONE MULTIPLE MYELOMA WINKING OWL SIGN VERTEBRAL METASTASIS DOUBLE DENSITY SIGN ANEURYSMAL BONE CYST PUNCTATE CALCIFICATION CHONDROBLASTOMA POPCORN CALCIFICATION CHONDROSARCOMA PATCHY CALCIFICATION CHONDROSARCOMA AND CHONDROBLASTOMA Features Giant cell tumour Simple bone cyst Aneurysmal bone cyst Fibrous dysplasia \u25cf       Age 20-40 yrs. < 20 yrs. 10-40 yrs. 20-30 yrs. \u25cf       Common bones Lower femur, Upper humerus Upper femur Tibia Humerus Neck of the femur Tibia \u25cf       Location Epiphysis Metaphysis Metaphysis Metaphysis \u25cf       X-ray Soap-bubble appearance, eccentrically placed Maximum width less than width of the growth plate Distending lesion, 'ballooning' the bone Multi-loculated Ground-glass appearance Trabeculations++ \u25cf       Treatment preferred Curettage and bone graft Curettage and bone graft Curettage and bone graft</p>\n<p></p>",
