      "explanation": "<p>Correct Option B- L4-L5: </p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u21b3 This is the correct vertebral level corresponding to Tuffier's line. Tuffier's line is drawn between the highest points of the iliac crests, and it usually intersects the spine at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra (L4) or the fifth lumbar vertebra (L5). It is an important reference for lumbar punctures because it helps determine the appropriate level for inserting the needle into the spinal canal without risk of damaging the spinal cord.</li><li>\u21b3 Incorrect Options:</li><li>\u21b3 Incorrect Options:</li><li>\u21b3 Option A- L2-L3: This vertebral level is not relevant to Tuffier's line. Tuffier's line, also known as the intercristal line, is an anatomical landmark that corresponds to the highest point of the iliac crests. It is used as a reference point for lumbar punctures (spinal taps). L2-L3 would not be the correct level for Tuffier's line.</li><li>\u21b3 Option A- L2-L3:</li><li>\u21b3 Option C- L5-S1: This vertebral level is not directly related to Tuffier's line. Tuffier's line is typically drawn above the level of L5-S1, as it corresponds to the highest points of the iliac crests. Lumbar punctures are usually performed below L5-S1, at the L3-L4 or L4-L5 level.</li><li>\u21b3 Option C- L5-S1:</li><li>\u21b3 Option D- L3-L4: This vertebral level is close to the correct answer but not exactly accurate. While Tuffier's line intersects the spine around the L4-L5 level, some sources might mention L3-L4 as an approximate reference point. However, the more precise and commonly accepted landmark is L4-L5.</li><li>\u21b3 Option D- L3-L4:</li></u\n\n\n<p style='font-size: 10px; color: #808080; font-style: italic;'></p>",
