Neck</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The commonest surgical approach to a retrosternal goiter is via the neck. This is because the thyroid gland is anatomically located in the neck, and even when a goiter extends behind the sternum into the chest, the neck provides the most direct and least invasive access for surgical removal. The retrosternal portion of the goiter can usually be mobilized and delivered into the neck for excision without the need for more invasive thoracic approaches. The vascular supply of the goiter also predominantly comes from cervical vessels like the inferior thyroid artery, making the neck approach feasible and effective.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Chest: Surgical approaches through the chest are typically not used for retrosternal goiters. Accessing the thyroid gland through the chest would involve more invasive procedures, such as thoracotomy, and is generally reserved for rare cases with specific indications, such as very large goiters extending deeply into the chest cavity.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Chest:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Median Sternotomy: Median sternotomy involves cutting through the breastbone (sternum) to access structures within the chest, particularly the heart and major blood vessels.
