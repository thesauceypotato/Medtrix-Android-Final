Methadone is long-acting, prevents withdrawal effects during opioid deaddiction, and also decreases the euphoric effect(kick) of opioids. Methadone is a potent mu-receptor agonist, and it suppresses the symptoms of opioids. Withdrawal Tolerance and physical dependence occur only at a slow rate with methadone compared to morphine. It is administered once daily, as it is long-acting. On abrupt discontinuation, it produces only mild withdrawal signs and symptoms. Hence methadone is used as substitution therapy for opioid dependence. A drug to prevent relapse of addiction is naltrexone. Naltrexone blocks all opioid receptors. When the patient tries to retake opioids, he will not get a euphoric effect as all the receptors are already blocked by naltrexone. So without getting a euphoric effect, the patient will not be retaking opioids.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist. It is used in the treatment of opioid toxicity. It counters and blocks the unwanted effects of opioid overdose. Option: B. Clonidine is a medicine for hypertension (high blood pressure).

Naltrexone is used to treat opioid dependence and alcohol addiction. It works by blocking the euphoric feelings (highs) that Some people may experience after taking opiates and alcohol. This reduces the craving and helps you stay away from them.</p>\n<p></p>",
