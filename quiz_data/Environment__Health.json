The recommended guideline values take into account both naturally occurring radioactivity and any radioactivity that may reach the water source due to man's activities. From a radiological point of view, they represent a value below which water can be considered potable without any further radiological examination. The activity of radioactive material is the number of nuclear disintegration per unit of time. The unit of activity is a becquerel (Bq); 1 Bq = 1 disintegration per second. Formerly, the unit of activity was curie (Ci). The proposed guideline values are: Gross alpha activity 0.5 Bq / L Gross beta activity 1.0 Bq / L</p>\n<p></p>",

However, in much smaller numbers than E.coli, the spores can survive in water for a longer time than organisms of the coliform group and usually resist chlorination at doses normally used in waterworks practice. Hence their presence in water denotes that fecal contamination has occurred, and their presence in the absence of coliforms denotes that contamination occurred at some remote time. The multiple tube method, also known as a presumptive coliform test, is used for bacteriological surveillance of water samples. E.coli can be tested by indole test and is the only organism producing gas from lactose at 44 degrees C. The level of residual chlorine must be 0.5mg/L in the water for successful chlorination.</p>\n<p></p>",

Naturally occurring nitrate levels in surface and groundwater are generally a few milligrams per litre. Generally, vegetables are the primary source of nitrate intake when levels in drinking water are below 10 mg/litre. When the nitrate level in drinking water exceeds 50 mg/litre, drinking water will become the main source of total nitrate intake. The guideline value for nitrate in drinking water is solely to prevent methamoglobinaemia, which depends upon converting nitrate into nitrite.

It is defined as the amount of oxygen absorbed by a sewage sample during a specified period, generally 5 days, at a specified temperature, generally 20 deg.C, for the aerobic destruction or use of organic matter by living organisms. BOD values range from about 1 mg per litre for natural water to about 300 mg per litre for untreated domestic sewage. If the BOD is 300 mg/l and above, sewage is said to be \"strong\"; if it is 100 mg/l, it is said to be \"weak.\" CHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND (COD): The COD test measures the oxygen equivalent of that portion of the organic matter in a sample susceptible to oxidation by a strong chemical oxidiser. This test may be the only practical method for determining the organic load if wastes contain toxic substances. SUSPENDED SOLIDS: The suspended solids are yet another indicator of the \"strength\" of sewage. The amount of suspended solids in domestic sewage may vary from 100 to 500 p.p.m. (mg/I). If the amount of suspended solids is 100 mg/l, the sewage is weak; if the amount is 500 mg/l, the sewage is strong.</p>\n<p></p>",

These are monitored on a daily basis over several sites. A central agency then collects the results. Sulphur dioxide: This gas is a major contaminant in many urban and industrial areas. Its concentration is estimated in all air pollution surveys. Smoke or Soiling index: A known air volume is filtered through a white filter paper under specified conditions, and the photoelectric meter measures the stain. Smoke concentration is estimated and expressed as micrograms/cubic metre of air as an average level over a period of time. Grit and dust measurement: Deposit gauges collect grit, dust, and other solids. There are analyzed monthly. Coefficient of haze: A factor used, particularly in the USA, in assessing the amount of smoke or other aerosols in the air.

Heat syncope is a sudden loss of consciousness due to vasodilation secondary to heat. Option: B. Heat cramps are characterized by painful muscle cramps, nausea, and vomiting. The core body temperature is normal. This is caused by sodium depletion due to sweating: the patient should be placed in a cool environment and hydrated with a balanced salt solution. Rest for at least 1 to 3 days is recommended. Option: D. Heat stroke is characterized by mental status changes and a core body temperature of more than 39\u00b0 Celsius. The cardiovascular collapse will occur if not treated immediately, as the body temperature may reach up to 41.1\u00b0 Celsius. This is a medical emergency requiring IV hydration and rapid cooling: cool water or isopropyl alcohol 70% on the body with fanning, sponge baths, ice packs on the groin/axilla/neck, and/or iced gastric lavage until the core body temperature drops to 39\u00b0 Celsius. Patients should be advised to avoid heat exposure for at least 4 weeks because hypersensitivity to heat may persist for a long period of time after an episode of heat stroke.</p>\n<p></p>",

Barotrauma (barosinusitis, middle ear or barotitis media) is due to the mechanical effects of expansion and contraction of gases when pressure differences exist between the body cavities and the environment. These two syndromes are manifestations of compression sickness occurring during descent. Option: C. The bends (so-called because the person can be stooped because of severe joint pain) are a form of decompression sickness (also called caisson disease) due to inadequate elimination of dissolved gas after a dive, affecting the skin and joints. Decompression sickness can occur either after a too rapid ascent from a dive below 9 meters or a sudden pressure loss at altitudes above 7000 feet.</p>\n<p></p>",

It occurs when the body becomes unable to control its temperature: its temperature rises rapidly, the sweating mechanism fails, and the body cannot cool down.it is characterized by very high body temperature, which may rise to 110\u00b0F (43.3\u00b0C) Symptoms of heat stroke Throbbing headache. Dizziness and light-headedness. Lack of sweating despite the heat. Red, hot, and dry skin. Muscle weakness or cramps. Nausea and vomiting. Rapid heartbeat, which may be either strong or weak. Rapid, shallow breathing. The outcome is often fatal. Treatment consists of rapidly cooling the body in an ice-water bath till the rectal temperature falls below 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C).</p>\n<p></p>",
