Raised FSH/LH ratio itself indicates the ovarian cause. No withdrawal bleeding on progesterone challenge test but getting withdrawal bleeding with estrogen and progesterone challenge test also indicates ovarian failure. Premature ovarian failure/premature menopause is amenorrhea associated with the depletion of oocytes before the age of 40 years Causes of Premature Ovarian Failure Genetic: (i) Turner\u2019s syndrome (45X0) , (45X/46XX), (ii) Gonadal dysgenesis 46XX, 46XY , (iii) Trisomy 18 and 13, (iv) X-chromosome deletion, translocation. Autoimmune: (i) Autoantibodies: antinuclear antibodies (ANA), Lupus anticoagulant, (ii) Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (antibodies against thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal,  islet cells of the pancreas). Infections: Mumps, tuberculosis . Iatrogenic : Radiation therapy, Chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide), Surgery. Metabolic: Galactosemia (the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase is absent Follicles are destroyed to the toxic effects of galactose), 17\u03b1 hydroxylase deficiency . Environmental: Diagnosis/Investigations: History of amenorrhea in less than 35 years of age . Serum gonadotropin level (FSH > 40 mIU/ml) is high . Serum E2 level is low (< 20 pg/ml). Karyotype abnormality Organ-specific humoral antibody (antithyroid commonest). Ovarian biopsy Management: To prevent or minimize postmenopausal health hazards, HRT should be judiciously employed. In proven cases of autoimmune disorders, corticosteroids may be of help. Induction of ovulation may be hopefully tried in the presence of follicles . IVF with donor\u2019s oocyte with total replacement of hormones can increase the chance of pregnancy.
