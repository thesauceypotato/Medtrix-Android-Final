The flashlight is swung to and fro and the pupillary response observed. Normally, both pupils should have remained constricted in the absence of any defect. In the presence of RAPD, when the flashlight is moved from the normal to the abnormal eye, both pupils dilate. Marcus Gunn pupil is a rare condition that affects the eyes, causing each to respond differently when a light is shone into them. This response indicates that there is dysfunction or disease in the optic nerve or retina.
