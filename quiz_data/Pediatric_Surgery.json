The proximal duodenum and pylorus dilate with swallowed amniotic fluid, rendering the pylorus temporarily incompetent. Types : Type I duodenal atresia \u2013 Obstructing web formed from mucosa and submucosa with no defect in muscularis. Type II duodenal atresia \u2013 Short fibrous cord connecting two blind ends of duodenum. There is no defect in the mesentery. Type III duodenal atresia \u2013 No connection between the two ends of the duodenum. V-shaped defect in mesentery Diagnosis : Occasionally, there is a web that may stretch like a windsock. If suspected antenatally, duodenal atresia is confirmed postnatally on an abdominal radiograph, showing a \u2018double bubble\u2019 , if missed, it presents with bilious vomiting. The hepatopancreatic duct may have openings on either side of the atresia, and a little gas can pass distally. Treatment : Open Kimura duodenoduodenostomy with or without a trans-anastomotic tube.</p>\n<p></p>",

Exomphalos minor (<5 cm, liver not involved) is commonly associated with other anomalies and the defect is easily closed. In exomphalos major the sac can be dressed with a topical antibacterial agent (e.g. manuka honey, silver sulfadiazine), allowing epithelialisation and later closure of the ventral hernia. If an early closure of an exomphalos major is attempted, close observation for an abdominal compartment syndrome is mandated.</p>\n<p></p>",
