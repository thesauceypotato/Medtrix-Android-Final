While some physicians use amantadine in patients with the early disease for its mild symptomatic effects, it is most widely used as an anti-dyskinesia agent in patients with advanced Parkinson\u2019s Disease . Indeed, it is the only oral agent that has been demonstrated in controlled studies to reduce dyskinesia without worsening parkinsonian features (indeed, motor benefits have been reported). Cognitive impairment is a major concern, particularly with high doses. Other side effects include livedo reticularis and weight gain. Amantadine should always be discontinued gradually because patients can experience withdrawal-like symptoms .

Levodopa- The cause of levodopa-induced motor complications is not precisely known. Rasagiline and Selegiline functionally inhibit MAO-B. They may increase dyskinesia in levodopa-treated patients, but this can usually be controlled by down-titrating the dose of levodopa. Tolcapone and entacapone- Two COMT inhibitors have been approved for use. More recently, opicapone (a long-acting, once-daily COMT inhibitor) has been approved in Europe. Side effects of COMT inhibitors are primarily dopaminergic (nausea, vomiting, increased dyskinesia) and can usually be controlled by down-titrating the dose of levodopa .</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Continuous infusion pump Striatal dopamine levels are normally maintained at a relatively constant level. In Parkinson\u2019s disease , dopamine neurons degenerate, and striatal dopamine is dependent on the peripheral availability of levodopa . Intermittent oral doses of levodopa result in fluctuating plasma levels because of variability in the transit of the drug from the stomach to the duodenum where it is absorbed and the short half-life of the drug. This variability is translated to the brain and results in exposure of striatal dopamine receptors to alternating high and low concentrations of dopamine(on and off phenomenon) Therefore, It can be resolved by Continuous infusion pump. A recent controlled study demonstrated that continuous intraintestinal infusion of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (Duodopa) is associated with significant improvement of \u201coff\u201d time and in \u201con\" time without dyskinesia in advanced Parkinson\u2019s patients compared with optimized standard oral levodopa.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The major concern with levodopa- chronic levodopa treatment is associated with the development of motor complications in the large majority of patients. These consist of fluctuations in motor response (\u201con\u201d episodes when the drug is working and \u201coff \u201d episodes when Parkinsonian features return as the drug wears off) and involuntary movements known as dyskinesias, which typically complicate \u201con\u201dperiods. When patients initially take levodopa , benefits are long-lasting (many hours) even though the drug has a relatively short half-life (60\u201390 min). With continued treatment, however, the duration of benefit following an individual dose becomes progressively shorter until it approaches the half-life of the drug. This loss of benefit is known as the wearing-off effect . Some patients may also experience a rapid and unpredictable switch from the \u201con\u201d to the \u201coff \u201d state known as the on-off phenomenon. Changes in motor response associated with chronic levodopa treatment. Levodopa-induced motor complications.
