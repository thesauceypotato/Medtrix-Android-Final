      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Malingering Malingering or shamming means conscious, planned feigning or pretending a disease for gain. Diseases may be feigned for several reasons, such as by soldiers or policemen to avoid their duties, by prisoners to avoid hard work, by businessmen to avoid business contracts, by workmen to claim compensation, by beggars to attract public sympathy, by criminals to avoid legal responsibility, etc. Patients can distort or exaggerate their symptoms, but true simulation is rare. The patient may injure his nasopharynx with a sharp instrument, swallow the blood and regurgitate it in front of the doctor to mimic hematemesis. A skilful puncturing of the anal or vaginal mucosa may produce bleeding. Excessive intake of digitalis may simulate a heart condition. Eating a large number of carrots will produce carotenemia and may simulate jaundice. Chronic ingestion of coumarin will induce a haemorrhagic diathesis</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Factitious disorder is a serious mental disorder in which someone deceives others by appearing sick, purposely getting sick, or self-injury. The factitious disorder can also happen when family members or caregivers falsely present others, such as children, as ill, injured, or impaired. Option: C. Munchausen's syndrome is a psychological disorder where someone pretends to be ill or deliberately produces symptoms of illness in themselves. Their main intention is to assume the \"sick role\" so that people care for them and they are the centre of attention.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Passive euthanasia Passive euthanasia means discontinuing or not using extraordinary life-sustaining measures to prolong life. This includes acts of omission, such as failure to resuscitate a terminally ill or hopelessly incapacitated patient or a severely defective newborn It is not using measures that would probably delay death, such as turning off a respirator, stopping medications or food and water and allowing the person to dehydrate or starve or not delivering (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), which permits natural death to occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option A: Active euthanasia is a positive merciful act to end useless suffering or a meaningless existence. It is an act of commission, e.g. by giving large doses of drugs to hasten death. Option C: Non-voluntary refers to cases of persons incapable of making their wishes known, e.g., in persons with irreversible coma or severely defective infants. Euthanasia advocates the administration of lethal doses of opium or other narcotic drugs. It has no legal sanction. Option D: Voluntary euthanasia means at the person's will, and involuntary means against the person's will,e., compulsory.</p>\n<p></p>",
