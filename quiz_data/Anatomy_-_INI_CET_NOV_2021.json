The axons from the pontine nuclei and other sources are called mossy fibers because of the appearance of their synaptic terminals. Mossy fibers synapse on granule cells in the granule cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. The cerebellar granule cells are the most abundant class of neurons in the human brain and give rise to specialized axons called parallel fibers that ascend to the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex.
