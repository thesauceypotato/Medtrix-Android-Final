It is usually indicative of ventricular hypertrophy or myocardial ischemia, which causes the ventricle to become stiff and less compliant. Atrial stenosis, on the other hand, is a narrowing of the opening between the atria, which can cause blood to back up into the lungs and lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue. It typically causes a mid-diastolic murmur and not an S4 heart sound. Therefore, the correct option is D.

It occurs just after atrial contraction and immediately before the systolic S1 and is caused by the atria contracting forcefully to overcome an abnormally stiff or hypertrophic ventricle. This produces a rhythm classically compared to the cadence of the word \"Tennessee.\". One can also use the phrase \"A-stiff-wall\" to help with the cadence (a S4, stiff S1, wall S2), as well as the pathology of the S4 sound S4 has also been termed an atrial gallop or a presystolic gallop because of its occurrence late in the heart cycle. It is a type of gallop rhythm by virtue of having an extra sound; the other gallop rhythm is called S3. The two are quite different, but they may sometimes occur together forming a quadruple gallop. If the heart rate is also very fast (tachycardia), it can become difficult to distinguish between S3 and S4 thus producing a single sound called a summation gallop.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Other Options:- Other options are correct except D Atrial stenosis.</p>\n<p></p>",

This delay in the cardiac pulse is extremely important: It ensures that the atria have ejected their blood into the ventricles first before the ventricles contract.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Normal AV Delay: When atrioventricular (AV) conduction is normal, mitral E and A waves are distinct (not fused) and A wave ends shortly (about 40-60 msec) before the onset of the next QRS on the ECG The AV node then \"gathers\" that electrical impulse and, after a brief delay, allows it to pass through to the ventricles. This brief delay in the transmission of the electrical signal through the AV node is critical to a normal heartbeat and the efficient functioning of the heart.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The delay does not indicate reduced contractility of the ventricles, which would result in a reduced ejection of blood. When the ventricle starts to contract, the pressure exceeds that of the corresponding atrium, resulting in the closure of the atrioventricular valves, preventing backflow of blood into the atria.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Decreased when the valves of the leg veins are incompetent The lymphatic system is responsible for draining excess interstitial fluid and returning it to the bloodstream. Lymphatic vessels have one-way valves that prevent the backflow of lymph fluid. When these valves are incompetent, the flow of lymph from the foot and leg is decreased, leading to lymphedema, a condition characterized by swelling and accumulation of lymph fluid.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Lymphatic vessels can be divided into two types: initial lymphatics and collecting lymphatics. The former lack valves and smooth muscle in their walls, and they are found in regions such as the intestine or skeletal muscle. Tissue fluid appears to enter them through loose junctions between the endothelial cells that form their walls. The fluid in them apparently is massaged by muscle contractions of the organs, contraction of arterioles and venules, with which they are often associated. They drain into the collecting lymphatics, which have valves and smooth muscle in their walls, and contract in a peristaltic fashion, propelling the lymph along the vessels.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Options: A & B.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Low cardiac output Cardiac output measured by thermodilution technique; is reliable.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Two methods of measuring output that are applicable to humans, in addition to Doppler combined with echocardiography, are the direct Fick\u2019s method and the indicator dilution method. Fick\u2019s principle states that the amount of a substance taken up by an organ (or by the whole body) per unit of time is equal to the arterial level of the substance minus the venous level (A-V difference) times the blood flow. This principle can be applied, of course, only in situations in which arterial blood is the sole source of the substance taken up. The principle can be used to determine cardiac output by measuring the amount of O2 consumed by the body in a given period and dividing this value by the A-V difference across the lungs. Because systemic arterial blood has effectively the same O2 content in all parts of the body, the arterial O2 content can be measured in a sample obtained from any convenient artery. A sample of venous blood in the pulmonary artery is obtained using a cardiac catheter. It has now become commonplace to insert a long catheter through a forearm vein and to guide its tip into the heart with the aid of a fluoroscope. To measure cardiac output by the \u201cindicator dilution method,\u201d a small amount of indicator, such as a dye, is injected into a large systemic vein or, preferably, into the right atrium. This indicator passes rapidly through the right side of the heart, then through the blood vessels of the lungs, through the left side of the heart, and, finally, into the systemic arterial system. The concentration of the dye is recorded as the dye passes through one of the peripheral arteries. A popular indicator dilution technique is thermodilution, in which the indicator used is cold saline. The saline is injected into the right atrium through one channel of a double-lumen catheter, and the temperature change in the blood is recorded in the pulmonary artery, using a thermistor in the other, longer side of the catheter. The temperature change is inversely proportional to the amount of blood flowing through the pulmonary artery; that is, to the extent that the cold saline is diluted by blood. This technique has two important advantages: The saline is completely innocuous. The cold is dissipated in the tissues so recirculation is not a problem, and it is easy to make repeated determinations.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Measurement of Cardiac Output: Fick\u2019s Law : CO = Total body O2 Consumption per minute/ arteriovenous oxygen difference. Echo : Ultrasound of heart, Record all volumes. Dye dilution method : CO = Amount of Dye/ Concentration X Time. Thermodilution : Calculate CO from Temperature Change. Note:- Dilution methods are not accurate if shunts/ fistula/ regurgitation are present.</p>\n<p></p>",
