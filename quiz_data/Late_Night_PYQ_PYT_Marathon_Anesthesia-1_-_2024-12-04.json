B. 3 min</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Preoxygenation or denitrogenation is the process of replacing nitrogen in the lungs with oxygen. This is typically done by giving 100% oxygen to the patient for 3 minutes through a tight-fitting mask or by asking them to take 8 vital capacity breaths. This process helps to lengthen the apnea time, providing an improved margin of safety while the anesthesiologist secures the airway and resumes ventilation.</li><li>\u2022 There are two main methods commonly used for preoxygenation:</li><li>\u2022 The first method involves utilizing tidal volume ventilation through a face mask for a duration of 3 minutes. This technique allows for the exchange of approximately 95% of the gas present in the lungs. The second method relies on vital capacity breaths to achieve effective preoxygenation in a shorter time frame. While four breaths over 30 seconds are not as efficient as the tidal volume method, it may still be deemed acceptable in specific clinical scenarios. Research has indicated that eight breaths over a span of 60 seconds are more effective for preoxygenation.</li><li>\u2022 The first method involves utilizing tidal volume ventilation through a face mask for a duration of 3 minutes.

D. 50 Hz</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 This is the frequency typically used for tetanic stimulation in neuromuscular monitoring. A stimulation of 50 Hz for 5 seconds results in a tetanic contraction. If the patient is under profound neuromuscular blockade, no contraction will be observed. If there's some recovery from blockade, a contraction will be noted but may be weaker than in a patient with no blockade. Fade during or after tetanic stimulation can indicate incomplete recovery from blockade.</li><li>\u2022 Tetanic stimulation is a method used in neuromuscular monitoring to assess the degree of neuromuscular blockade in patients who have received neuromuscular blocking agents (often used during surgeries to produce muscle paralysis). Tetanic stimulation involves giving a high-frequency series of electrical impulses to a peripheral nerve to cause sustained muscle contraction. The response to tetanic stimulation can help determine the depth of neuromuscular blockade and the presence of fade.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 0.2 Hz : This frequency is more representative of a \"single twitch\" stimulation, where one stimulus is delivered every 5 seconds. It is used to monitor the initial onset and the later stages of recovery from neuromuscular blockade.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 0.2 Hz</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 2 Hz : This refers to a train-of-four (TOF) stimulation where four stimuli are given at a frequency of 2 Hz (2 stimuli per second). It's a common method of monitoring neuromuscular blockade, especially when assessing for residual blockade. A fading response in the TOF is indicative of neuromuscular blockade.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 2 Hz</li><li>\u2022 Option C. 20 Hz : This isn't a standard frequency for neuromuscular monitoring.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. 20 Hz</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective :</li><li>\u27a4 The frequency of tetanic stimulation used in neuromuscular monitoring is typically 50 Hz.</li><li>\u27a4 PATTERN OF NERVE STIMULATION:</li><li>\u27a4 PATTERN OF NERVE STIMULATION:</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Miller\u2019s Anesthesia, 9 th Ed.

However, in contemporary practice, syringes used for ABG are pre-heparinized, which means they already contain a coating of dry heparin that will mix with the blood sample and prevent clotting. Adding additional heparin to such a syringe is unnecessary and can dilute the sample, potentially altering the results.</li><li>\u2022 Add 0.5 ml Heparin to the syringe before taking blood:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Normal pH can't rule out acid base disorder: This statement is accurate. A patient can have a mixed acid-base disorder where two primary disorders (e.g., metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis) coexist and \"cancel\" each other out, leading to a seemingly \"normal\" pH. However, when the components of the arterial blood gas (ABG) like PaCO2 and HCO3- are evaluated, abnormalities can be detected.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Normal pH can't rule out acid base disorder:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. If modified Allen\u2019s test is negative, alternate site is chosen: The modified Allen's test is a simple way to evaluate the collateral blood flow to the hand via the ulnar artery.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. B. CO2 embolism</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 In the scenario described, a sudden decrease in end-tidal CO2 (etCO2) to 8 mm Hg, along with a drop in blood pressure (BP) to 80/50 mm Hg and oxygen saturation (SpO2) to 90%, but with normal peak airway pressure (18 mm Hg), strongly suggests a CO2 embolism. During laparoscopic procedures, CO2 is used for insufflation to create a pneumoperitoneum, which can occasionally enter a blood vessel and cause a CO2 embolism. This event leads to a rapid decrease in etCO2 due to reduced return of CO2 to the lungs, hypoxemia, and cardiovascular collapse. The normal peak airway pressures help differentiate it from other causes of acute respiratory distress.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Pneumothorax : A pneumothorax, or collapsed lung, could occur due to barotrauma from mechanical ventilation or surgical complications. However, it typically causes an increase in peak airway pressures due to increased resistance to ventilation. The absence of increased peak airway pressures makes pneumothorax less likely in this case.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Pneumothorax</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Endobronchial Intubation : Endobronchial intubation occurs when the endotracheal tube is inserted too far and intubates one of the main bronchi, typically the right main bronchus. This can lead to hypoventilation of one lung, causing a decrease in etCO2 and SpO2. However, peak airway pressures might be higher due to one-lung ventilation, which was not observed here.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Endobronchial Intubation</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Bronchospasm : Bronchospasm involves the constriction of the muscles in the walls of the bronchioles, leading to narrowed airways. This would usually present with an increase in peak airway pressures due to the narrowed airways, which is not consistent with the normal peak airway pressures reported in this scenario.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Prolonged exposure to high FiO\u2082 levels increases the risk of oxygen toxicity and absorption atelectasis. Therefore, FiO\u2082 should be reduced below 60% once oxygenation is adequate. The elevated PaCO\u2082 (58 mmHg) with a near-normal pH (7.33) reflects compensated respiratory acidosis, which is acceptable in the context of lung-protective ventilation strategies. In ARDS, permissive hypercapnia is an accepted approach where mild-to-moderate CO\u2082 retention is tolerated to avoid volutrauma and barotrauma from high tidal volumes or aggressive ventilation.
