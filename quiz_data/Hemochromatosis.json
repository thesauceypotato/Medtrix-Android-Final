Hepcidin is regulator of iron absorption . (\u201c HEP atic bacteri CID al prote IN \u201d) It has both antifungal and antibacterial activity. Hepcidin exerts its antimicrobial action by restricting serum iron . Total body iron stores, Hypoxia, and inflammation regulate it. Iron gets absorbed as Fe 2+. The storage form of iron is Fe 3+. It leaves the cell through ferroportin and gets converted to Fe 2+ . Now this is bound to transferrin and goes to the marrow for erythropoiesis. Ferroportin is controlled by Hepcidin which is released by the liver. HFEgene controls the expression of Hepcidin .
