The spores germinate and the botulinum toxin released inhibits acetylcholine release at NMJ thereby causing flaccid paralysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Botulism :- Eating raw uncooked or canned meat can cause botulism. The spores germinate and the botulinum toxin released inhibits acetylcholine release at NMJ thereby causing flaccid paralysis. BoNT binds to presynaptic nerve terminals of the voluntary motor and autonomic NMJs. Botulinum toxins are a family of seven neurotoxins out of which A,B and E are toxic to humans. The heavy chain moiety of the toxin promotes endocytosis, after which the light chain is cleaved and released into the cytosol. The light chain of A and E targets and cleaves serotype-specific targets SNAP-25 while that of B targets SYNAPTOBREVIN(VAMP) of the SNARE  polypeptide complex, proteins required for fusion of ACh-containing vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. Normal Fusion allows exocytosis of ACh into the NMJ and depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. But by cleaving these fusion complexes, BoNT blocks presynaptic ACh release and inhibits muscle contraction, causing flaccid paralysis. Symptoms can include ptosis (drooping eyelid), diplopia (double vision), dysarthria (slurred speech), dysphonia (difficulty speaking), and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. The botulinum toxin found in improperly canned meat inhibits the NMJ rather than stimulating it. Option: C. Inhibition of brush border villi: This option refers to the inhibition of brush border villi. Brush border villi are tiny projections present on the surface of the small intestine, involved in nutrient absorption. However, in the context of poisoning due to canned uncooked meat, the mechanism of action is not related to the inhibition of brush border villi. Option: D. D. Stimulation of brush border villi: This option suggests that poisoning due to canned uncooked meat stimulates the brush border villi. However, this is not the mechanism of action for this type of poisoning. The involvement of brush border villi is not relevant to this scenario. Therefore, this option is incorrect.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Autoimmune disorder where antibodies are formed against desmosomes Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antibodies against desmosomes, which are cell adhesion molecules. Desmosomes are responsible for maintaining the integrity and cohesion of epithelial cells. In pemphigus vulgaris, autoantibodies target desmogleins, which are proteins present in desmosomes. The fishnet appearance observed on immunofluorescence (IF) is due to the deposition of antibodies around individual epidermal cells.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disorder caused by autoantibodies that target keratinocyte proteins (desmogleins) Bullous pemphigoid is the autoimmune disorder where antibodies are formed against bullous pemphigoid antigens (BPAGs) BP 180 and BP 230 which are components of hemidesmosomes</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Autoimmune disorder where antibodies are formed against hemidesmosomes: This option describes a different autoimmune disorder called bullous pemphigoid. In bullous pemphigoid, autoantibodies target hemidesmosomes, which are cell structures that anchor the epidermis to the underlying basement membrane. This results in the formation of subepidermal blisters rather than the intraepidermal blisters seen in pemphigus vulgaris. Option: B. Autoimmune disorder with anti-connexon antibodies: This option does not correspond to any known autoimmune disorder. Connexons are protein structures involved in gap junctions, which are important for cell-to-cell communication. Autoantibodies against connexons are not associated with pemphigus vulgaris. Option: C. Disease with poorly formed cell adhesion molecules: This option does not specifically describe pemphigus vulgaris. While the disruption of cell adhesion is a key feature of pemphigus vulgaris, the underlying cause is the production of autoantibodies against desmosomes, rather than a general deficiency in cell adhesion molecules.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
