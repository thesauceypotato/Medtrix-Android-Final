T 2 Tumour invades mucosa of more than one adjacent subsites of supraglottis or glottis or region outside the supraglottis (e.g., mucosa of base of tongue, vallecula, medial wall of pyriform sinus) without fixation of the larynx T 3 Tumour limited to larynx with vocal cord fixation and/or invades any of the following: postcricoid area, pre-epiglottic tissues, paraglottic space and/or minor thyroid cartilage invasion. T 4 a Tumour invades through the thyroid cartilage and/or invades tissues beyond the larynx (e.g., trachea, soft tissues of neck including deep extrinsic muscle of tongue, strap muscles, thyroid or oesophagus). T 4 b Tumour invades prevertebral space, encases carotid artery or invades mediastinal structures. Glottis T\u2081 Tumour limited to vocal cord(s) (may involve anterior or posterior commissures) with normal mobility. T\u2081a Tumour limited to one vocal cord. T\u2081b Tumour involves both vocal cords.

T 4 a Tumour invades through thyroid cartilage and/or invades tissues beyond the larynx (e.g., trachea, soft tissues of neck including deep extrinsic muscles of the tongue, strap muscles, thyroid, or oesophagus).

T 4 a Tumour invades cricoid or thyroid cartilage and/or invades tissues beyond the larynx (e.g., trachea, soft tissues of neck including deep extrinsic muscle of tongue, strap muscles, thyroid or oesophagus).
