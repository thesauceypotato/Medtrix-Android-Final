This rise in fibrinogen contributes significantly to the increased ESR. ESR: The ESR can increase up to four times during pregnancy due to the increased levels of fibrinogen and globulin. Platelet Count: There may be a slight fall in platelet count during pregnancy, commonly due to gestational thrombocytopenia, which is caused by hemodilution and increased platelet consumption. This condition usually has no adverse effect on pregnancy and is often observed in the third trimester. Coagulation Factors: There is an increase in the plasma levels of several coagulation factors, including factors 1 (fibrinogen), 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Factors 2, 5, and 12 remain unchanged or mildly increased, while factors 11 and 13 are slightly decreased. Clotting Time: Clotting time is generally unaffected by pregnancy.

A) Sexual abstinence for 3 months and avoid pregnancy for a year</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) is a type of urinary fistula that commonly arises due to obstetric trauma. Small fistulas can heal spontaneously; however, most established fistulas require surgical repair. The surgical repair is usually performed vaginally after approximately 3 months to allow inflammation to subside. Post-operatively, continuous bladder drainage for 14 days along with antibiotics is recommended to facilitate healing. Following VVF repair, it is recommended that the patient abstain from sexual activity for 3 months to allow the surgical site to heal properly and avoid complications. Additionally, pregnancy should be avoided for a year to ensure the integrity and strength of the repair before subjecting the area to the stresses of pregnancy and childbirth.</li><li>\u2022 Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) is a type of urinary fistula that commonly arises due to obstetric trauma.</li><li>\u2022 Small fistulas can heal spontaneously; however, most established fistulas require surgical repair.</li><li>\u2022 The surgical repair is usually performed vaginally after approximately 3 months to allow inflammation to subside.</li><li>\u2022 Post-operatively, continuous bladder drainage for 14 days along with antibiotics is recommended to facilitate healing.</li><li>\u2022 Following VVF repair, it is recommended that the patient abstain from sexual activity for 3 months to allow the surgical site to heal properly and avoid complications.</li><li>\u2022 Additionally, pregnancy should be avoided for a year to ensure the integrity and strength of the repair before subjecting the area to the stresses of pregnancy and childbirth.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Sexual abstinence for 3 weeks and avoid pregnancy for 6 months</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. A. Factor 2</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 Factor 2 would have decreased gamma carboxyglutamate residue in a patient on warfarin therapy.</li><li>\u2022 Factors II, VII, IX, X are vitamin k dependent coagulation factors, as their activated by carboxylation of their glutamate residues by enzyme y-glutamyl carboxylase requires vitamin K (reduced form) as a co-factor.</li><li>\u2022 This reduced form of vitamin K is constantly oxidized for the reaction to continue. This recycling is done by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase. This enzyme is inhibited by warfarin. Thus, warfarin affects vitamin k dependent factors.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Factor 11 : Incorrect, Factor XI is not vitamin K-dependent and thus not directly affected by warfarin therapy.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Factor 11</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Tissue factor : Incorrect, Tissue factor (Factor III) is a different component of the clotting cascade that acts as a receptor and cofactor for Factor VIIa; it is not a vitamin K-dependent factor and is not affected by warfarin.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Tissue factor</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Factor 5 : Incorrect, Factor V is not dependent on vitamin K for its function, so its activity is not diminished by warfarin therapy.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Factor 5</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Warfarin therapy impacts the function of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors by inhibiting the recycling of vitamin K, crucial for the carboxylation of these factors. Factor 2 (prothrombin) is one of these affected factors, leading to a reduction in its clotting ability in the presence of warfarin, which is utilized therapeutically to prevent thrombosis.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
