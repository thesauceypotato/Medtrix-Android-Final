      "explanation": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection (TAPVC) is a congenital heart defect in which the pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium. Instead, oxygenated blood from the lungs is redirected to the right atrium via connections to the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, or both. This leads to a total mixing lesion where both oxygenated and deoxygenated blood mix completely, resulting in equal oxygen saturation in all four heart chambers. Blood reaches the left atrium and subsequently the left ventricle only through an atrial septal defect (ASD) or a patent foramen ovale, which shunts the mixed blood from the right atrium. This unique feature of TAPVC results in the characteristic finding of equal oxygen saturation in all cardiac chambers. TAPVC often presents with cyanosis, respiratory distress, and poor feeding in neonates and requires urgent surgical correction to restore normal pulmonary venous return.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A) Tetralogy of Fallot: This defect involves right ventricular outflow obstruction, a ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy.

A) Achalasia cardia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Achalasia cardia, commonly referred to as achalasia, is a medical condition that affects the esophagus, specifically the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the muscles of the esophageal wall. This condition is characterized by the following features:</li><li>\u27a4 Failure of LES Relaxation: In achalasia, the LES, a muscular ring that separates the esophagus from the stomach, does not relax properly during swallowing. Normally, the LES should relax to allow food and liquids to pass into the stomach, but in achalasia, this relaxation is impaired. Incomplete Emptying of the Esophagus: Due to the dysfunctional LES, the esophagus is unable to empty food and liquids into the stomach efficiently. This leads to a gradual buildup of food and fluids in the esophagus, causing symptoms. Difficulty in Swallowing: The most prominent symptom of achalasia is dysphagia, which is difficulty in swallowing. Patients often experience a sensation of food getting stuck in the chest while eating and may need to drink fluids or change their body position to help food pass into the stomach. Regurgitation: As a result of the esophageal emptying problems, patients with achalasia may also experience regurgitation of undigested food, often occurring at night when lying down. Chest Pain: Some individuals with achalasia may experience chest pain or discomfort, often due to the accumulation of food and fluids in the esophagus.</li><li>\u27a4 Failure of LES Relaxation: In achalasia, the LES, a muscular ring that separates the esophagus from the stomach, does not relax properly during swallowing.

It is the primary surgical treatment for achalasia. Pneumatic Dilation: In this non-surgical procedure, a balloon is inflated within the LES to stretch and disrupt the muscle fibers, making it easier for food to pass. Botulinum Toxin Injection: Injecting botulinum toxin directly into the LES can help relax the muscle temporarily.
