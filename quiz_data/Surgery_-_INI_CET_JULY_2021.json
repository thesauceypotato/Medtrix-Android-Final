Adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated in case of LN positivity, tumor size larger than 1 cm, or adverse prognostic factors like a blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion, high nuclear or histologic grade, or Her-2-neu overexpression in LN negative tumors larger than 0.5 cm. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, mastectomy, and adjuvant RT are recommended for Stage IIIA with N1 patients who respond well to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are necessary for grossly involved internal mammary nodes (N3b) . Hormonal therapy is preferred over cytotoxic therapy for patients with distant metastases (Stage IV) who have hormone receptor-positive (ER/PR positive) tumors, bone or soft tissue metastases only, or limited or asymptomatic visceral metastases. Systemic chemotherapy is recommended for patients with hormone receptor-negative tumors , hormone-refractory tumors after three endocrine regimens, or symptomatic visceral metastases . Local, regional recurrence can be treated with resection of the repeat with reconstruction, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and RT if not previously received for those who had a mastectomy or with mastectomy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy for those with lumpectomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Union for International Cancer Control-American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging system (eighth edition) for breast cancer.

Bile duct injury can be caused by acute or chronic inflammation, obesity, anatomic variation, bleeding, acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis, cholangitis, and obstructive jaundice . Inadequate surgical technique and failure to identify structures before ligating or dividing them are common causes of significant biliary injury. Intraoperative cholangiography may help limit the extent of bile duct injury but does not prevent it. Symptoms of bile duct injury may include jaundice with or without abdominal pain. Major ductal injuries are often recognized intraoperatively due to bile leakage, abnormal cholangiogram, or late anatomy recognition. Patients may present with cholangitis or cirrhosis months or years after prior surgery due to a biliary tract injury. Diagnosis of bile duct injury involves imaging studies like USG or CT . The patient should be stabilized with immediate parenteral antibiotics, image-guided percutaneous drainage of fluid collections , and Cholangiography done to identify the level and nature of the injury. Postoperative biliary strictures are best diagnosed with PTC , while ERCP is useful for patients with bile duct continuity who require urgent cholangiography and biliary decompression. CT arteriography is useful in preoperatively evaluating patients with benign biliary strictures to detect unrecognized injury to the hepatic artery or a portal vein branch. In patients presenting with late strictures with evidence of liver dysfunction, a CT arteriogram should be performed to evaluate for evidence of portal hypertension.</p>\n<p></p>",

Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) is rarely needed in patients with common bile duct stones but can be performed for diagnostic and therapeutic reasons in patients with contraindications to endoscopic or surgical approaches.

Each successive suture should be placed at twice this distance apart Each suture should reach into the depths of the wound and be placed at right angles to the axis of the wound.

Typically found in the rectosigmoid area and have a serrated, saw-toothed appearance. No risk of developing cancer. Hamartomatous Polyps Localized overgrowth of normal, mature intestinal epithelial cells. Usually lined with normal epithelium over a submucosal core. Juvenile polyps are the most common type of colorectal hamartomas and often occur in children under 5. Symptoms include rectal bleeding, mucus discharge, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Also known as retention polyps due to the inflammatory obstruction of the crypt necks leading to cystic dilation of the mucus-filled glands. No increased risk of cancer. Peutz-Jegher\u2019s Syndrome (AD) Characterized by hamartomatous polyps with arborization and pseudoinvasion. Inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Inflammatory Polyps More commonly found in chronic ulcerative colitis , but can also occur in Crohn\u2019s disease . No malignant potential and typically requires no treatment other than that of the underlying condition.</p>\n<p></p>",

They are bilateral in 5% of cases and familial in 1%. Pathology : The tumor has mixed elements derived from the embryonic nephrogenic tissue, namely blastemal or undifferentiated tissue, epithelial tubules, and stroma. Presentation : The typical presentation is a child aged between 1 and 4 years of either gender with a large, palpable abdominal mass that may cross the midline. It may also be associated with haematuria, hypertension, fever, and weight loss. Pain is relatively uncommon. The large tumor can rupture and present as an acute abdomen. Differential Diagnosis : Other causes of renal masses include neuroblastoma, congenital mesoblastic nephroma, RCC, clear-cell sarcoma, and rhabdoid tumor. Investigations : The US can confirm the mass's renal origin and solid nature. Further definitive imaging with either CECT or MRI is necessary to stage the disease. Up to 13% of patients have bilateral tumors. The tumors usually infiltrate the kidneys, and normal renal parenchyma is compressed at the periphery around the tumor (claw sign) .

These crystal nuclei may be washed off with the flow of urine or they may anchor onto sites like renal papillae to form Randall\u2019s plaques. Variations in the pH of urine may also facilitate or inhibit stone growth; acidic pH precipitates the formation of uric acid stones and alkaline pH precipitates the formation of calcium phosphate stones. Hence, the manipulation of pH through medication can help in preventing new stone formation Milk Of Calcium Stones: Stasis of urine also promotes stone formation.
