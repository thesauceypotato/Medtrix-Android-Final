Whilst initially presumed to be a benign condition, long-term follow-up suggests that patients with fishtail deformity are prone to: Functional impairment Ongoing pain Development of early osteoarthrosis Fishtail deformity of the distal humerus can be of the 2 types: The first type is a sharp angled wedge,commonly occurs after fractures of the lateral condyle. It is caused by the persistence of a gap between the lateral condylar physis ossifiaction center and the medial ossification of the trochlea. Because of this gap,the lateral crista of the trochlea may be underdeveloped,which may represents a small \u201cbony bar\u201d in the distal humeral physis The second type is believed to be associated with osteonecrosis of the lateral part of the medial crista of  the trochlea.</p>\n<p></p>",

Approximately 10\u201330% of the periphery of the medial meniscus and 10\u201325% of the lateral meniscus are vascularized in adulthood. There are additional vessels from the middle geniculate artery that supply the horns of the menisci.

Red-white zone: This is the middle one-third that represents a transitional zone between the vascular and avascular sections of the meniscus . White-white zone : This is the inner one-third of the meniscus which is completely avascular in adults Zones of meniscus A partial meniscectomy is typically used to trim torn or frayed edges of the meniscus. This eliminates the mechanical symptoms caused by a meniscus tear. A meniscus tear that occurs in the peripheral third of the meniscus, the so-called \u201cred-red zone\u201d of the meniscus, should be treated by repair with suture. The reason for this is that the peripheral third of the meniscus is well-vascularized and capable of healing.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Forward bending test The forward bending test is used as a screening tool in scoliosis. Adam\u2019s forward bending test is performed on a patient to differentiate structural from non structural scoliosis. The patient is asked to bend forward at the waist until the spine is at the horizontal level. The knees must be maintained straight,with feet together and the arms hanging. The examiner observes the trunk from behind (to assess midthoracic and lumbar rotation) and from the front(to assess upper thoracic rotation)</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Scoliosis, lateral curvature of the spine, is a structural alteration that occurs in a variety of conditions. Progression of the curvature during periods of rapid growth can result in significant deformity, which may be accompanied by cardiopulmonary compromise. Scoliosis is defined as curvature of the spine in the coronal plane. It is typically accompanied by a variable degree of rotation of the spinal column. By convention, >10\u00b0 of curvature (as measured by the Cobb angle) defines scoliosis . Curves with Cobb angle \u226410\u00b0 are within the normal limits of spinal asymmetry and have no long-term clinical significance. The Cobb angle (arrow in radiograph) is formed by the intersection of a line parallel to the superior end plate of the most cephalad vertebra in a particular curve, with the line parallel to the inferior end plate of the most caudal vertebra of the curve. The intersection of these lines may occur outside the border of the actual film. Therefore, by convention, perpendiculars to the parallels are drawn, and the angle between their intersection is measured.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Tennis elbow A counterforce brace is used in tennis elbow as it releases the force in tennis elbow. as it releases the forces in the extensor carpi radialis brevis. (ECRB) region. The counter force brace acts by compression of the extensor muscles thereby preventing the tension from transmitting up to the lateral epicondyle.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Tennis Elbow: The most common overuse syndrome is related to excessive wrist extension and commonly referred to as \u201ctennis elbow,\u201d but it is actually more common in non-tennis players. It is also commonly referred to as lateral epicondylitis, but this is usually a misnomer because, in general, microscopic evaluation of the tendons does not show signs of inflammation, but rather angio fibroblastic degeneration and collagen disarray. Light microscopy reveals both an excess of fibroblasts and blood vessels that are consistent with Neo vessels or angiogenesis There are numerous treatment options, but no one single treatment is completely effective. Watchful waiting Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDS) Corticosteroid injection Counterforce bracing Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ECSWT) Ultrasound-guided percutaneous radiofrequency thermal lesioning Laser therapy Acupuncture Autologous blood Platelet rich plasma (PRP) Hyaluronate (HA) injections Polidocanol (vascular sclerosant) Botulinum toxin (BTX) Topical nitrates Counterforce braces are used in an attempt to reduce the tension forces on the wrist extensor tendons, and these orthotics may be superior to lateral epicondyle bandages in reducing resting pain.  The brace should be applied firmly approximately 10 cm distal to the elbow joint. Use of a counterforce brace may decrease pain and increase grip strength at 3 weeks in individuals with lateral epicondylitis.
