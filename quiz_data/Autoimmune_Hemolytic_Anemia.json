      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All the above Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) It is an autoimmune disorder due to the presence of auto- antibodies directed against platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb and IIIa resulting in premature removal of platelet by macrophage monocyte system. Cause of Autoimmune Thrombocytopenia:- Idiopathic - ITP Secondary SLE Lymphoma, CLL HIV Drugs Solid tumors Clinical Features of ITP:- In children: Typically presents 2 \u2013 3 weeks after a viral infection with sudden onset of purpura, nasal or oral bleeding. In adults: ITP involves females more commonly and has insidious onset. Symptoms and signs of collagen vascular disorders (like rheumatoid arthritis) may be present. The course is chronic with remissions and relapses. Splenomegaly and bleeding in the joints are not the features of ITP. In ITP, BT is prolonged but CT is normal. Investigation:- P/S = large platelet, isolated thrombocytopenia with normal TLC and RBC count In ITP, BT is prolonged but CT is normal USG= spleen not enlarged BM = increase thromboblast megakaryocytes Management:- In children, the disease is usually self \u2013 limiting within a few weeks. Drugs therapy:- Prednisolone best initial treatment Intravenous immunoglobulin (it is the fastest to act in acute and severe bleeding. It prevents activation of macrophages. It is not given in Rh negative patients) Rituximab: It is used if a patient is not responding to prednisolone and I/V immunoglobulin. Splenectomy If count < 20,000 /ml and recurs repeatedly despite giving above therapies.</p>\n<p></p>",
