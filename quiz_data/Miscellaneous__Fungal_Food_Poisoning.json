      "text": "Caucasian woman, age 37, graphic designer, married, with two children, with no previous surgery, had a traffic trauma, which is why she was referred for an upper abdomen ultrasound. The ultrasound registered a tumor mass in the right liver lobe over 10 cm in diameter. After that, a computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging gave the diagnosis of a primary liver tumor, which was compressing the right and middle hepatic veins. Other laboratory parameters showed slightly elevated hepatic enzymes with normal bilirubin levels. There were no hepatitis antibodies or elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). The patient was in good physical condition, a bi-cycle driver, and hiker. The only suggestion she gave in a medical interview before the operation was that she consumed over two liters of milk and other dairy products (yogurt and white cheese) per day over 20 years. Toxin produced which of the following fungal organisms can be suspected as a cause for the patient's condition?",
