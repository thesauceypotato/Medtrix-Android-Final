Viral in origin and may be seen in influenza epidemics. It causes severe pain in the ear and blood-stained discharge when the bullae rupture. Treatment with analgesics is directed to give relief from pain. Antibiotics are given for secondary infection of the ear canal, or middle ear if the bulla has ruptured into the middle ear.</p>\n<p></p>",
