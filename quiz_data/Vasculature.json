      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Arterioles Along with arterioles ephedrine will also act on the \u03b21 receptor and increase heart rate so it affects both arterioles and the heart (the heart is not in the question. So only arterioles is the answer).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Ephedrine is both a direct and indirect sympathomimetic amine (mixed acting) Q which acts on \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, and \u03b22 receptors; however, its primary mode of action is indirectly achieved by inhibiting neuronal norepinephrine reuptake and displacing more norepinephrine from storage vesicles. This action allows norepinephrine to be present in the synapse longer to bind postsynaptic alpha and beta receptors. The binding of ephedrine and released NE leads to vasoconstriction and inotropic and chronotropic action-which leads to tachycardia and palpitations (as given in the question). \u03b11 adrenergic receptors predominate on arteriolar smooth muscle, so these muscles contract when stimulated with norepinephrine and cause increased BP. \u03b21 receptors cause positive inotropic and chronotropic action and increase heart rate and contractility. Cheese reaction Q: Hypertensive reaction resulting from the release of noradrenaline by tyramine (present in cheese; also in higher amounts in older cheese) and other sympathomimetic amines (such as ephedrine) as a consequence of irreversible MAO-A inhibitors (earlier used for depression). In this question drug-drug interaction between phenelzine (MAO-I) (as phenelzine by causing irreversible inhibition of MAO interferes with the metabolism of NE and other catecholamines) and Ephedrine (which prevents the reuptake of NE is there which resulted in this reaction). Ephedrine Diet Pills dramatically accelerate the metabolism without adjusting diet and exercise habits and increasing the metabolism will lead to accelerated weight loss. (such pills are banned by FDA).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A: Bronchioles: Ephedrine also acts on \u03b22 receptors which lead to bronchodilation but this respons:e is not as marked as CVS effects and not responsible for the symptoms given in the question and hence not the answer. Options B & C - Pupils and intestines are not much affected and are not at all related to symptoms in the question.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Tachyphylaxis: Tachyphylaxis is loss of response to a drug on repeated administration. It is shown by ephedrine due to neuronal depletion of Norepinephrine as the presynaptic end. Serotonin Syndrome : serotonin syndrome occurs when an overdose of a single drug, or concurrent use of several drugs, results in excess serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. 5HT 2 receptors are thought to be involved. Dantrolene is of no value. The neuroleptic malignant syndrome is idiosyncratic and appears to be associated with hypersensitivity to the parkinsonism-inducing effects of D2-blocking antipsychotics in certain individuals. Malignant Hyperthermia is associated with a genetic defect in the RyR1 Q calcium channel of the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum that permits uncontrolled calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum when precipitating drugs are given.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Venules and veins Venules and veins have the greatest percentage of the redistributed blood volume. It means the largest portion of blood at rest is in systemic veins and venules. The greatest percentage of the redistributed blood volume in this case would come from the veins, specifically the venules and veins distal to the site of the tourniquet. This is because the veins are more compliant than arteries and arterioles, and can hold a larger volume of blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The total circulating blood volume is approximately 70 mL/kg, about two-thirds of which is found in the systemic veins and venules. A significant volume of blood (9%) is found in pulmonary circulation. The large volume of blood found on the venous side of the circulation is used to adjust circulating blood volume. For example, during hemorrhage, contraction of the veins and venules of the skin increases the amount of blood available for perfusion of the heart and brain. Capacities vessels are considered to be the blood vessels that hold the majority of the blood and can adapt quickly to changes in the amount of blood flowing through them. Veins are typically believed to be the most common type of vein. The venous vasculature contains the biggest amount of blood volume, accounting for 70-80% of total blood volume. As a result, veins are referred to as capacitance vessels in medical terminology.</p>\n<p></p>",
