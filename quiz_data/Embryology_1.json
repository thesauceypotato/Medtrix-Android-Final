The uterus develops from a Mullerian duct, hence the uterus will be present but underdeveloped (infantile) due to lack of estrogen. Pseudohermaphroditism in females means Gonads are ovaries but external genitalia is male. The external genitalia of males is due to exposure to androgens in females at early stages of development, and not because of the absence of ovaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>differentiation of gonads is by sry gene presence of amh regression of mullerian duct and absence of uterus differentiation of external genitalia is by dihydrotestosterone</p>\n<p></p>",
