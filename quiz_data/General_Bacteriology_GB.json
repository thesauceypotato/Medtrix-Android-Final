      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Resist phagocytosis Gram-positive organisms have cell walls composed primarily of a thick peptidoglycan layer and teichoic acid. However, additional cell wall components are often present that contribute to virulence, motility, or the ability to adhere to epithelial surfaces. For instance, the cell wall of group A streptococcus (also known as Streptococcus pyogenes) is studded with M protein, a virulence factor that inhibits phagocytosis, prevents complement binding, and aids in epithelial attachment. M protein is an alpha-helical coiled-coil protein that shares epitopes and structural homology with other alpha-helical coiled-coil proteins such as tropomyosin and myosin. In some patients, the protective antibodies against M protein that develop in S pyogenes acute infection may cross react with myosin epitopes in the heart and cause rheumatic carditis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. Efflux pumps are generally globular proteins with multiple domains. They reside in the bacterial cell membrane and excrete toxic substances from the interior of the cell. Bacteria can use efflux pumps to generate antibiotic resistance to drugs that operate in the interior of the cell, such as fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. Option B and C. The bacterial cell wall provides mechanical support and protects it from osmotic lysis. It is composed primarily of peptidoglycan, which forms a mesh-like, cross-linked polymer of peptides and sugars.</p>\n<p></p>",
