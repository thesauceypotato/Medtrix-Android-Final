Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) accumulation in the orbital tissues is one of the main causes of Graves's ophthalmopathy . TSH receptors are expressed in the thyroid gland as well as the intraorbital adipocytes and fibroblasts . TSH receptor antibodies in patients with Grave's disease bind to the orbital TSH receptors and stimulate orbital fibroblasts to secrete GAG and the adipocytes to proliferate. GAGs are hyperosmolar, drawing intracellular/intravascular fluid out into the interstitial space and causing edema of the orbital contents.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>GAG accumulation , edema, and increased adipocytes increase the orbital pressure and push the globe forward, causing exophthalmos, compression of the extraocular muscles, ophthalmoplegia (inability to converge eyes, diplopia, difficulty reading), and ocular pain.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. In patients with hyperthyroidism, the \"staring look\" is due to sympathetic hyperactivity of the levator palpebrae superioris .

This patient presents with ocular features that are characteristically only seen in Grave's disease. Option: C. Idiopathic granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus is seen in Tolosa-Hunt syndrome , a rare disease characterized by ocular pain and ophthalmoplegia due to pressure on the nerves adjacent to the cavernous sinus (cranial nerves III, IV, V, and VI). Although this patient also presents with ocular pain and features of ophthalmoplegia (inability to converge eyes, diplopia, difficulty reading) , examination shows exophthalmos and features of hyperthyroidism that are not associated with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome . Option: D. Bacterial infection of the orbital contents (orbital cellulitis) presents with proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and ocular pain. Patients with orbital cellulitis typically have a fever, a source of infection (rhinosinusitis, dacryocystitis, acute otitis media), and pain in extraocular movements, which are absent in this patient.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Grave\u2019s ophthalmopathy, also called thyroid eye disease, is an inflammatory disorder affecting the orbit around the eyes and is characterized by upper eyelid retraction, lid lag, swelling redness(erythema), conjunctivitis and bulging.
