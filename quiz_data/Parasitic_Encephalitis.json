MRI showed a solitary 2 cm mass in the posterior left temporal lobe. A biopsy showed that the mass contained necrotizing inflammation with trophozoites, morphologically different from any of the species previously found in association with infection in humans. Although the type of organism causing the infection was not identified at the time, the patient underwent surgical excision of the tumor-like mass and received antibiotic therapy, and recovered without any neurologic sequelae. The causative agent was later identified as Sappinia diploid on the basis of distinct morphological features in hematoxylin-eosin-stained brain sections and by transmission electron microscopy images of sections from the brain lesion. Which of the following is the locomotive organ of a causative organism?",

Sabin Fieldman dye test was positive. The patient was admitted to our center. Physical examination during admission was normal.
