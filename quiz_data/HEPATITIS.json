      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Envelope proteins have variations in their antigenic structure Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has six or more genotypes and multiple subtypes that differ in genomic composition by as much as 30%-35%. This is mainly because the virion-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has no proofreading 3'-->5' exonuclease activity, resulting in many replication errors. Although most patients have a single genotype, the high mutation rate leads to distinct quasispecies within infected individuals over time. These variant strains differ primarily at hypervariable genomic regions, such as those found in the sequences coding for its envelope glycoproteins. The continuous generation of novel envelope glycoproteins prevents infected individuals from mounting an effective immune response. As the production of host antibodies against a quasispecies commences, that strain dies off, and new ones occur. The tremendous antigenic variety of HCV has significantly slowed efforts to develop an effective vaccine.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Anti-HCV HCV RNA Nonreactive Negative Negative Current Infection Positive Positive Past Infection Positive Negative</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options A & B.

Every year, there are an estimated 20 million HEV infections worldwide, leading to an estimated 3.3 million symptomatic cases of hepatitis E. The virus has been mainly associated with the consumption of raw or undercooked pork meat or offal but also with wild boar meat, venison, and shellfish. The study confirms that HEV infections occur throughout the year and is a major (34%) cause of acute jaundice in tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh. Three-quarters of the acute hepatitis E cases were male, and HEV infection was higher among patients residing in urban areas than in rural areas.
