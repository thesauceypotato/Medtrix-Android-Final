      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Retinoic acid Impaired dark adaptation of the eyes , which can lead to night blindness , is an early symptom of vitamin A deficiency. Xerophthalmia (which is nearly pathognomonic ) results from keratinization of the eyes. It involves drying (xerosis) and thickening of the conjunctivae and corneas . Superficial foamy patches composed of epithelial debris and secretions on the exposed bulbar conjunctiva ( Bitot spots ) develop. In advanced deficiency, the cornea becomes hazy and can develop erosions , which can lead to its destruction ( keratomalacia ). Keratinization of the skin and of the mucous membranes in the respiratory , gastrointestinal , and urinary tracts can occur. Drying, scaling, and follicular thickening of the skin and respiratory infections can result. Immunity is generally impaired . The younger the patient, the more severe are the effects of vitamin A deficiency.

MANAGEMENT: Dietary deficiency of vitamin A is traditionally treated with vitamin A palmitate in oil 60,000 units orally once a day for 2 days , followed by 4500 units orally once a day. If vomiting or malabsorption is present or xerophthalmia is probable, a dose of 50,000 units for infants < 6 months , 100,000 units for infants 6 to 12 months , or 200,000 units for children > 12 months and adults should be given for 2 days , with a third dose at least 2 weeks later.

Papillary All forms of conjunctivitis will have some form of Papillary hypertrophy. Papillae are described as elevations of the conjunctiva with a central core blood vessel. As the conjunctiva becomes thickened by infiltration with inflammatory cells, The individual papillae are created by septae that are fibrous connections of the epithelium to the underlying substantia propria. B. Giant Papillary When the individual septae separating papillae break down , multiple individual papillae merge to form a giant papilla. Giant papillae are conjunctival elevations that are greater than 1 mm in size. Most commonly occur on the upper tarsal conjunctiva . They usually have flat tops and seem to fit together like cobblestones , hence the descriptive term \u201c cobblestone papillae \u201d. C. Follicular Dome-shaped conjunctival elevations with a circumferential blood vessel and clear center. Histopathologically , follicles are aggregations of mononuclear inflammatory cells that are organized similarly to follicles within lymph nodes. When follicles are present in conjunction with papillary hypertrophy, there is a follicular conjunctivitis D. Membranous/Pseudomembranous Membranes and pseudomembranes are sheets composed of a network of fibrin and inflammatory cells that form a layer over the surface of the conjunctiva . True membranes have a growth of capillaries from the conjunctiva into the membrane , while pseudomembranes are avascular. Either type of membrane is a sign of severe inflammation where the conjunctiva is very friable , and stripping either type of membrane causes bleeding E. Cicatrizing Some forms of conjunctivitis lead to progressive conjunctival scarring, or cicatrization. Findings associated with cicatrization include: stellate or linear subconjunctival scars shortening of the conjunctival Fornices formation of symblepharon . Eventually ankyloblepharon cicatricial entropion loss of conjunctival goblet cells leading to conjunctival and corneal keratinization.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hard exudates in DR Retinal edema and hard exudates are caused by the breakdown of the blood-retina barrier , allowing leakage of:- serum proteins, lipids, and protein from the vessels. Hard exudates (HEs) in the retina are one of the hallmark sign s of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and, when present within the macular region, indicate the presence or previous existence of diabetic maculopathy. Microaneurysms Microaneurysms are the earliest clinical sign of diabetic retinopathy and occur secondary to capillary wall outpouching due to pericyte loss. They appear as small red dots in the superficial retinal layers , and there is fibrin and red blood cell accumulation in the microaneurysm lumen. A rupture produces blot/flame hemorrhages. Affected areas may appear yellowish in time, as endothelial cells proliferate and produce basement membranes. Dot and blot hemorrhages Dot and blot hemorrhages occur as microaneurysms rupture in the deeper layers of the retina, such as the inner nuclear and outer plexiform layers. These appear similar to microaneurysms if they are small; fluorescein angiography may be needed to distinguish between the two. Flame-shaped hemorrhages Flame-shaped hemorrhages are splinter hemorrhages that occur in the more superficial nerve fiber layer. Cotton-wool spots Cotton-wool spots are nerve fiber layer infarctions from occlusion of precapillary arterioles. With the use of fluorescein angiography , there is no capillary perfusion . These are frequently bordered by microaneurysms and vascular hyperpermeability. Venous loops and venous beading Venous loops and venous beading frequently occur adjacent to areas of nonperfusion and reflect increasing retinal ischemia. Their occurrence is the most significant predictor of progression to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Signs of Diabetic Retinopathy:- Retina thickening and edema (swelling) New blood vessels Hemorrhages Microaneurysms Cotton wool spots Hard exudates</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Pathophysiology DR is a microangiopathy primarily affecting the precapill capillaries, venules and post capillary venules.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Exposure keratitis The most common risk factors of exposure Keratopath y include:- lagophthalmos, chemosis, Bell\u2019s palsy, and congenital deformities like coloboma. Colobomas without microcornea (abnormally small cornea) or microphthalmia (abnormally small eyes) reportedly have the best visual prognosis , while Complex colobomas associated with microphthalmia and retrobulbar cysts have the worst visual prognosis .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Clinical signs of exposure Keratopathy: Signs Description Punctate corneal erosion A result of the cornea of the affected eye experiencing unusual dryness, culminating in epithelial cell loss. This sign can be visualized via fluorescein stain. In EK, these erosions may appear small or coalesce into a single, much larger lesion. Chemosis A swelling of the conjunctiva, leading to edema of the eyelids. This sign, along with lagophthalmos, is highly correlated to the development of EK in ICU patients. Decreased tear meniscus A normal eye should have a thin tear layer along the margins of the eyelid. Absence of this indicates dry eyes. Corneal filaments An appearance of \u201cmucoepithelioid\u201d areas of adherence involving the cornea, related to corneal epithelial dysfunction in the setting of dry eyes due to an increased mucus-to-tear ratio. Lubricating drops may help remove them, or these can be removed during a slit lamp exam. Corneal ulceration An open wound that appears on the cornea due to severely dried eyes. This condition carries a serious risk of corneal scarring and thus must be treated promptly.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Differential diagnosis of keratopathies: Condition Description Exposure keratopathy A result of severe eye dryness over a significant period of time. Signs include pain, redness, blurred vision, and a mucopurulent discharge from the affected eye. Must be treated immediately in order to avoid vision loss. Corneal abrasion An injury to the eye resulting in breach of the corneal epithelial layer, but does not progress. Commonly present as a foreign body sensation in the affected eye. Typically heals without intervention, though antibiotics may be given in select cases involving contact lenses. Vernal keratoconjunctivitis A dry eye condition that arises in dry climates with a seasonal periodicity. It features the appearance of giant papillae in the upper tarsals. Treatment includes artificial tears and removal of allergens. Corneal foreign body (FB) Irritation of the eye resulting from presence of a FB, commonly an eyelash or material related to the patient\u2019s occupational exposure (e.g., dust, metal or wood fragments). Treatment includes removal of the FB under slit lamp exam. Toxic irritation Redness of the eye associated with the presence of a toxic irritant. Appears as a bilateral infiltrate, usually associated with contact lenses. A similar form of this condition appears within a day after laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery, and resolves without intervention. Hypersensitivity reaction Redness of the eyes and mucopurulent discharge usually due to seasonal allergies/hay fever. Can be treated with cool compresses and antihistamines as needed. Ulcerative keratitis Thinning of the cornea related to autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. These patients are vulnerable to such complications as superinfection and perforation. Management tends to be medical, although surgery is indicated for patients with impending or current perforation. Mooren\u2019s ulcer An idiopathic corneal thinning that may be unilateral or bilateral. It may lead to corneal ulceration. This condition carries important associated risks, including glaucoma, perforation, and blindness, but is a diagnosis of exclusion. Epithelial keratopathy Punctate erosive lesions of the cornea that do not progress to EK, given that there are no other predisposing factors. Band keratopathy Corneal scarring that leads to a subepithelial opaque calcified plaque over the lens of the eye. These mostly appear in the elderly and have a particular horizontal deposition pattern, along with a chalky appearance. Treatment is typically conservative and requires only observation. However, in severe cases surgery is ~95% effective.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

In cases of foreign body injury, the initial investigation should be X-ray followed by further investigations, if needed. In case of ophthalmic injury within the globe , USG can be done instead of X-ray as the initial IOC. Contraindications for MRI include the following: Metallic implants Claustrophobia Pacemakers, although new protocols allow imaging in selected cases MR-incompatible prosthetic heart valves Contrast allergy Body weight (MRI tables have specific weight limitations) In the presence of any of these contraindications , a regular radiograph may be indicated.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>EFFECTS OF PENETRATING INJURY Mechanical effects of the trauma Introduction of infection Post-traumatic iridocyclitis Sympathetic ophthalmitis</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>SLIT LAMP EXAMINATION Conjunctiva:- Foreign Bodies Hemorrhagic Chemosis Conjunctival laceration Epithelial Defect Corneal Laceration (length, depth, width Cornea Sclera Scleral laceration/ Rupture Anterior Chamber Cells, fibrin, FB in AC Depth of AC Iris and Angle Iris prolapse/plugging the wound Sphincter tear Iridodialysis Iridodonesis Cyclodialysis Crystalline Lens Phacodonesis Subluxation Dislocation Rupture of Anterior / Posterior Capsule Intralenticular FB Posterior Segment examination Vitreous haemorrhage Retinal detachment Retinal dialysis Retinal tear Posterior vitreous detachment Choroidal rupture Optic nerve trauma IOFB</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
