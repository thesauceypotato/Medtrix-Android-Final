It is the m/c lesion associated with anterior dislocation of the shoulder joint . Bankart lesion is an avulsion in the anteroinferior part of the glenoid labrum caused due to the recurrent anterior dislocation of the humeral head. Hill-Sachs lesion is a compression fracture on the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head. It is caused by the pressure of the anterior glenoid rim on the humeral head in recurrent dislocations. Anterior dislocation is the commonest shoulder dislocation and can be caused due to trauma from behind the shoulder pushing the head out anteriorly. It is also caused due to falling on an outstretched hand in an abducted and externally rotated shoulder. It can be diagnosed on clinical examination with flattening of the shoulder contour and ability to place a rule (Hamilton ruler test) and the inability to touch his/her opposite shoulder (Duga's test). X- ray confirms the diagnosis and may show associated Hill Sachs or bony bankart lesion. The most common complication is recurrent shoulder dislocation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Complication of shoulder dislocation There are common to all three types of dislocations. The most common complication of the shoulder dislocation is recurrence The most common acute complication is axillary nerve injury, which leads to loss of sensation on lateral aspect of arm (regimental badge sign) and loss of motor power to deltoid and teres minor. Recurrence of anterior dislocation of shoulder Produces two lesions Hill Sach's lesion: On posterolateral superior aspect of humeral head Bankart's lesion on anterior surface of the glenoid Recurrence of posterior dislocation produces, reverse hill Sach\u2019s lesion also k/a McLaughlin's lesion.</p>\n<p></p>",
