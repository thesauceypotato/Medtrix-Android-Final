      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Gamma The given scenario is of Alpha thalassemia stillborn with hydrops fetalis due to severe anemia. Alpha thalassemias are caused by reductions in alpha globin chains. Reduced accumulation of \u03b1-globin leaves non-\u03b1-globins unpaired and unable to participate in the formation of functional hemoglobin tetramers. In the fetus, absent or reduced synthesis of \u03b1-globin allows unpaired \u03b3-globin chains, which are usually part of the HbF tetramer, to form \u03b34 or Hb Bart\u2019s . Hb Bart\u2019s has a very high O2 affinity and does not unload O2 in tissues. Severe anemia in Hb Bart\u2019s hydrops fetalis is a result of absent normal hemoglobin and ineffective erythropoiesis. Mothers of infants with Hb Bart\u2019s hydrops fetalis have a history of stillbirth and develop preeclampsia, polyhydramnios, and antepartum hemorrhage and have difficult labor and delivery. Intrauterine transfusion of the fetus is possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Since alpha globin chains are required for the synthesis of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F), manifestations of alpha thalassemia begin during the prenatal period.

The predominant cause of anemia is intramedullary destruction of erythroid precursors, known as ineffective erythropoiesis. Reduced deformability and phosphatidylserine exposure also cause extra- and intravascular hemolysis of those erythrocytes that gain entrance into the circulation.
