It has primarily replaced lymphangiography . A radiolabeled sulfur colloid (technetium 99 m sulfur colloid) is injected into the subdermal, interdigital region of the affected limb. The lymphatic transport is monitored with a whole-body gamma camera, and primary lymphatics and nodes can be visualized. Tracer activity may be detected in the inguinal region within 15 to 60 minutes in normal individuals. Within 3 hours, uptake should be present in the pelvic and abdominal lymph nodes. In patients with lymphedema, various patterns may be seen on lymphoscintigraphy. There may be delayed or absent transport to the inguinal nodes.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A -It provides useful information about the venous function, including DVT and other venous abnormalities. Option C - A single, axial computed tomography (CT) slice through the mid-calf has been proposed as a useful diagnostic test for lymphoedema (coarse, non-enhancing, reticular 'honeycomb pattern in an enlarged subcutaneous compartment), venous oedema (increased volume of the muscular compartment) and lipoedema (increased subcutaneous fat). CT can also be used to exclude pelvic or abdominal mass lesions. It can also be used to monitor response to treatment through serial measurements of cross-sectional area and tissue density. Option D - More recently, fluorescent molecules, such as indocyanine green (ICG), are being used to image the superficial lymphatic system. When excited using appropriate light energy, these molecules emit photons with a different wavelength that can be detected using dedicated near-infrared imaging devices, providing excellent anatomic and functional details of the lymphatic system. This imaging is increasingly being used to study the lymphatic system and the effects of some therapies.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Lymphedema is not curable, but the symptoms and long-term effects can be controlled with a combination of elastic compression stockings, limb elevation, pneumatic compression, and massage.

The stockings reduce the amount of swelling in the involved extremity by decreasing edema accumulation while the extremity is dependent. Compression stockings have been associated with long-term maintenance of reduced limb circumference when worn daily. They may also protect the tissues against chronically elevated intrinsic pressures, which lead to skin and subcutaneous tissue thickening. Compression stockings also offer protection against external trauma that may lead to cellulitis. The compression required for controlling lymphedema ranges from 20 to 60 mmHg and varies among patients. The stockings can be custom-made or prefabricated and are available in above- and below-knee lengths. The stockings should be worn during waking hours. The garments should be replaced approximately every 6 months when they lose elasticity.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Lymphedema is not curable, but the symptoms and long-term effects can be controlled with a combination of elastic compression stockings, limb elevation, pneumatic compression, and massage.

The use of IPC with a single-chamber or multi-chamber pump temporarily reduces edema and provides another adjunct to the use of compression stockings . These devices effectively reduce limb volume; however, compression stockings are necessary to maintain the volume reduction when the patient is no longer supine because fluid transport is not associated with the transport of macromolecules (proteins) from the tissue. Typically, IPC is used for 4 to 6 hours per day at home when the patient is supine, with pressure ranges between 30 and 60 mmHg demonstrated to be most effective.</p>\n<p></p>",
