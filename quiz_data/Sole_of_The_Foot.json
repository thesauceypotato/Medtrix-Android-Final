      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Physiological pes planus Pes planus denotes an excessively flat foot. There is no precise degree of flatness that defines pes planus but it may be either physiological or pathological. In physiological pes planus, the feet are flexible and rarely problematic. There is a high prevalence in children of preschool age. In the age group 2-6 years , normal arch volumes in the sitting and standing positions correlate with the height of the navicular (lowest palpable medial projection of the navicular to the floor)</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A- Pathological pes planus is often associated with stiffness and pain. The windlass (or 'Jack's great toe' ) test involves passively dorsiflexing the great toe at the metatarsophalangeal joint. This tightens the plantar aponeurosis and, in flexible pes planus, results in the accentuation of the medial longitudinal arch. In pathological pes planus, no accentuation of the arch is seen. Option C- Pes cavus denotes an excessively higharched foot. Most cases arise due to a neurological disorder (e. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, tethered spinal cord, poliomyelitis ). According to the anatomical location of the deformity, pes cavus may be classified into hindfoot, midfoot or forefoot cavus. Option D- When pes cavus involves all three parts of the foot, it is called 'global' cavus .</p>\n<p></p>",
