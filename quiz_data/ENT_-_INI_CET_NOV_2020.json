It is not the complication of chronic otitis media.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Delta sign - It is a CT sign of dural venous sinus thrombosis of the lateral sinus, where contrast outlines a triangular filling defect, which represents thrombus. Griesinger sign \u2013 It refers to oedema of the postaural soft tissue overlying the mastoid process as a result of the mastoid emissary vein. Bezold abscess (neck abscess as a result of direct extension from suppuration in the mastoid tip). A Bezold abscess may result from perforation of the medial mastoid cortex, tracking down sternomastoid to the posterior triangle.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1, 2 and 4 Pure Tone Audiometry is a subjective, behavioral, measurement of a hearing threshold, as it relies on patient response to pure tone stimuli. Rest all other options are objective tests of hearing.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>PTA- The purpose of  PTA is to determine the hearing thresholds for pure tones, which are sinusoidal signals with a single defined frequency, amplitude and phase. It is a subjective, behavioral, measurement of a hearing threshold, as it relies on patient response to pure tone stimuli. USES OF PURE TONE AUDIOGRAM (a) It is a measure of threshold of hearing by air and bone conduction and thus the degree and type of hearing loss. (b) A record can be kept for future reference. (c) Audiogram is essential for prescription of hearing aid. (d) Helps to find degree of handicap for medicolegal purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- BERA- It is an objective test of eliciting brain stem potentials in response to audiological click stimuli. OAE - Otoacoustic emissions are sounds produced by motile elements of cochlear outer hair cells. OAEs are used as a screening test of hearing in neonates and to test hearing in uncooperative or mentally challenged individuals after sedation. Sedation does not interfere with OAEs. They help to distinguish cochlear from retrocochlear hearing loss. OAEs are absent in cochlear lesions, e.g. ototoxic sensorineural hearing loss. They detect ototoxic effects earlier than pure tone audiometry. OAEs are also useful to diagnose retrocochlear pathology, especially auditory neuropathy. Auditory neuropathy is a neurologic disorder of CN VIII. TYMPANOMETRY It is based on a simple principle, i.e. when a sound strikes tympanic membrane, some of the sound energy is absorbed while the rest is reflected. A stiffer tympanic membrane would reflect more of sound energy than a compliant one. \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0435 \u0410 Normal tympanogram. Type As Compliance is lower at or near ambient air pressure. Seen in fixation of ossicles, e.g. oto- sclerosis or malleus fixation. Type AD High compliance at or near ambient pressure. Seen in ossicular discontinuity or thin and lax tympanic membrane. Type B A flat or dome-shaped graph. No change in compliance with pressure changes. Seen in middle ear fluid or thick tympanic membrane. Type C Maximum compliance occurs with negative pressure in excess of 100 mm H2O. Seen in retracted tympanic membrane and may show some fluid in middle ear.</p>\n<p></p>",
