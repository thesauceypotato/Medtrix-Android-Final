It is a large flask-shaped cell. Climbing fibres from the inferior olivary nucleus stimulate it. This cell's main output is inhibitory in nature and is directed at cerebellar nuclei. These are the most important output neurons.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Caudate Nucleus : It's one of the structures that make up the basal ganglia in the brain. The caudate nucleus has a long, C-shaped structure and is located laterally in the brain, near the lateral ventricles. It plays roles in various functions like voluntary movement control, learning, memory, and emotion. Purkinje cells do not primarily relay into the caudate nucleus.</li><li>\u2022 Option A.</li><li>\u2022 Caudate Nucleus</li><li>\u2022 Option B . Lentiform Nucleus : Another component of the basal ganglia, the lentiform nucleus is located deep within the brain and is laterally placed in relation to the thalamus. The lentiform nucleus is made up of two structures: the putamen and the globus pallidus. It's involved in movement regulation and other functions. Purkinje cells do not have a direct relay into the lentiform nucleus.</li><li>\u2022 Option B</li><li>\u2022 Lentiform Nucleus</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Red Nucleus : Found in the midbrain, the red nucleus has a reddish hue due to its rich blood supply and the presence of iron. It plays a role in motor coordination, particularly in the coordination of limb movements. While the red nucleus does receive input from the cerebellum, the primary relay from Purkinje cells is to the deep cerebellar nuclei, not directly to the red nucleus. The dentate nucleus, in turn, can send projections to the red nucleus.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.</li><li>\u2022 Red Nucleus</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Dentate Nucleus is one of the deep cerebellar nuclei and is situated within the white matter of the cerebellum.

Distal end of ulna</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The distal end of the ulna does not directly participate in the wrist joint. Instead, it articulates with the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). The TFCC acts as a cushion and allows for the smooth rotation of the radius over the ulna during forearm pronation and supination. Due to this articulation with the TFCC and not with the carpal bones, the distal end of the ulna does not form the wrist joint.  .</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

Triquetrum : The triquetrum is another one of the carpal bones. It is located on the ulnar side of the carpus.

Distal end of radius : The wrist joint is primarily formed by the articulation between the distal end of the radius and the proximal row of carpal bones, specifically the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum. Thus, the distal end of the radius plays a crucial role in the formation and function of the wrist joint.</li><li>\u2022 Option C</li><li>\u2022 Distal end of radius</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The radiocarpal joint, also known as the wrist joint, is a synovial, biaxial, and ellipsoid joint created by the articulation of:</li><li>\u27a4 Triangular fibrocartilage articular disc The scaphoids, lunates, and triquetrum</li><li>\u27a4 Triangular fibrocartilage articular disc</li><li>\u27a4 The scaphoids, lunates, and triquetrum</li><li>\u27a4 Just the scaphoid and lunate are in contact with the radius and articular disc when the wrist is in its neutral position; the triquetrum does not come into contact with the disc until the wrist joint is fully adducted.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
