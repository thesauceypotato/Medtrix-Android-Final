      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Layers 1, 4 & 6 The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN, also called the lateral geniculate body or lateral geniculate complex) is a relay centre in the thalamus for the visual pathway. It receives a major sensory input from the retina. The LGN is the main central connection for the optic nerve to the occipital lobe, particularly the primary visual cortex. In humans, each LGN has six layers of neurons (grey matter) alternating with optic fibres (white matter). The LGN is a small, ovoid, ventral projection at the termination of the optic tract on each side of the brain.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Six laminae of \u2018grey matter\u2019 and intervening white strata are composed of axons and dendrites. The grey laminae are like six irregularly stacked cones, ranging from one ventrally at the hilum to six dorsally. The two inner layers consist of loosely arranged large cells(magnocellular while the four outer layers consist of small and medium-sized cells(parvocellular).</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Position of Visual Fibres: Macular fibres coming in the optic tract occupy two thirds of LGB Upper retinal fibres occupy the medial half of the anterior one-third of LGB Lower Retinal fibres occupy the lateral half of the anterior one-third of the LGB</p>\n<p></p>",

Absence of both direct and consensual light reflex on the affected side (say right eye) and presence of both direct and consensual Q light reflex on the normal side (i.e., left eye) indicates efferent pathway defect (sphincter paralysis). Near reflex is also absent on the affected side. Its causes include the effect of parasympatholytic drugs. (e.g., atropine, homatropine), internal ophthalmoplegia, and third nerve paralysis. Option: B. is the paradoxical response of a pupil to light in the presence of a relative afferent pathway defect (RAPD). Causes of Marcus Gunn's pupil include incomplete optic nerve lesions and severe retinal diseases. It is tested by swinging flashlight test. Option: D. Here, both pupils are slightly small in size, and reaction to near reflex is a present, but light reflex (both direct and consensual) is absent, i.e., there is light near dissociation (to remember, the acronym ARP may stand for 'accommodation reflex present') . Both pupils are involved and dilate poorly with mydriatics.

The affected pupil is larger (anisocoria ). It is caused by postganglionic parasympathetic pupillomotor damage. It is usually unilateral , associated with an absent knee jerk and occurs more often in young women. Adie's pupil constricts with weak pilocarpine (0.125%) drops, while the normal pupil does not because the denervated iris sphincter is super sensitive to topical parasympathomimetics.</p>\n<p></p>",
