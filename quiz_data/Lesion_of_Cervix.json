It can vary in position and can move over time, especially in response to hormonal changes or with certain conditions such as pregnancy or inflammation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Cervix: Anatomy and Histology It has 2 main parts: Ectocervix : Visible part of the cervix that protrudes into the vagina It is lined by stratified squamous epithelium. Can withstand friction and mechanical stress. Endocervix : Part of the cervix that extends into the cervical canal . It is lined by simple columnar epithelium. This type of epithelium produces mucus and plays a role in fertility and menstruation. Squamous-columnar junction : Boundary between the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix and the columnar epithelium of the endocervix. The transformation zone: Area of the cervix where the squamous epithelium transitions to the columnar epithelium. The unique epithelial environment of the cervix renders it highly susceptible to infections with HPV.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option:A., B., D: All are true</p>\n<p></p>",

Type 16 and 18 are high risk: True statement. Human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 are considered high-risk types as they are associated with an increased risk of developing cervical cancer. Option: B. High-risk HPVs are also implicated in SCC arising at many other sites: True statement. In addition to cervical cancer, high-risk HPVs, including types 16 and 18, are also implicated in the development of squamous cell carcinomas in other sites such as the anus, vulva, vagina, penis, and oropharynx. Option: D. The cancer-producing capability is because of E6 and E7 proteins: True statement. These proteins interfere with cell cycle regulation and promote the degradation of tumor suppressor proteins, allowing infected cells to proliferate and evade normal cellular control mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>HPV strains Disease HPV type associated with the disease Cutaneous Plantar Wart 1,2 Common Wart 2,1 Flat Wart 3, 10 Butcher's wart 7,2 Genital Bowen's disease (intraepithelial neoplasm) 16 (Genital) 2, 3, 4, 16 (Extragenital) Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (full skin 2, 3, 5, 8, 9 thickness wart can become squamous cell cancer) 10, 12, 14, 15, 17 Condylomata acuminata (venereal or genital warts) Intraepithelial neoplasms Low grade 6, 11      High grade 16, 18 Respiratory papillomatosis (transmitted from mother to baby) 6,11</p>\n<p></p>",

Hence, the correct answer is D. All of the above</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Features of pilocytic change caused by HPV Nuclear enlargement : Koilocytes exhibit enlarged nuclei compared to the surrounding cells. The nuclei may appear irregular in shape and size. Nuclear hyperchromasia : Koilocytes often display increased nuclear staining, leading to hyperchromatic nuclei. The nuclei appear darker or more intensely stained compared to the surrounding cells. Perinuclear halo: One of the characteristic features of koilocytes is the presence of a perinuclear halo or clear zone surrounding the nucleus. This halo is caused by cytoplasmic vacuolization or clearing around the nucleus. Irregular nuclear contours : The nuclei of koilocytes may have irregular or uneven borders, contributing to their characteristic appearance. Binucleation or multinucleation : Koilocytes can sometimes have multiple nuclei within a single cell, leading to the presence of binucleated or multinucleated cells. Cytoplasmic vacuolization: The cytoplasm of koilocytes may contain vacuoles or clear spaces, giving the cells a bubbly or frothy appearance. Indistinct cell borders : Koilocytes often have indistinct or blurred cell borders due to cytoplasmic changes and vacuolization.</p>\n<p></p>",
