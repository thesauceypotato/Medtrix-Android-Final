TPN: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a method of feeding that bypasses the gastrointestinal tract . Fluids are given into a vein to provide most of the nutrients the body needs. The method is used when a person cannot or should not receive feedings or fluids by mouth. Option: B. Pancreatic surgery does not usually interfere with the function of the gastrointestinal tract and enteral route. After pancreatic surgery, TPN should or only be used when there is intolerance to enteral nutrition or enteral nutrition is contraindicated. Option: C. Feeding Gastrostomy: Gastrostomy is used to provide a route for tube feeding if needed for four weeks or longer, and/or to vent the stomach for air or drainage. Disadvantages of gastrostomy feeding include the surgery required to place the tube, possible skin irritation or infection around the gastrostomy site, increased incidence of nausea and vomiting , increased incidence of aspiration pneumonia due to gastroesophageal reflux and a slight risk of intra-abdominal leakage resulting in peritonitis.</p>\n<p></p>",

The position of the nasogastric tube will need to be checked before the feed is administered, either by pH testing (pH <5 is considered safe) or with a chest radiograph to confirm that the tip of the nasogastric tube is below the diaphragm and well past the bronchial bifurcation Abdominal radiographs can confirm the position of the nasojejunal tube if there is any concern regarding proximal migration or displacement</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Parenteral Nutrition is the continuous infusion of a hyperosmolar solution containing carbohydrates, proteins, fat, and other necessary nutrients through an indwelling catheter inserted into the superior vena cava Indications: Short Bowel Syndrome Intestinal Fistulation In addition to Enteral Feeding or TPN Composition: The energy content of parenteral nutrition is in the ratio of 150\u2013250 kcal per gram of protein nitrogen, with usually 30\u201350% of the energy coming from fat.
