Alcohol-based hand rubs are preferred in most cases, but soap and water should be used for visibly soiled hands and in cases of outbreaks of certain pathogens like Clostridium difficile. Hand hygiene should be performed before and after every direct patient contact, before donning gloves, and after removing gloves. Additionally, hand hygiene should be performed while moving from a contaminated site to a clean site during patient care. It is important to note that using hand rub is not appropriate if the hands are visibly soiled, as the rub cannot effectively remove dirt and debris from the hands. In such cases, soap and water handwashing is recommended.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

The sartorius muscle originates from the anterior superior iliac spine and the upper half of the notch below it, and runs obliquely across the thigh to insert into the superior aspect of the medial surface of the tibial shaft near the tibial tuberosity. It joins the aponeurosis of the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles to form the pes anserinus.</li><li>\u2022 The sartorius muscle is responsible for several actions, including flexion, abduction, and lateral rotation of the thigh, as well as flexion of the leg.
