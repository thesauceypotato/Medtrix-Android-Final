Here's a breakdown of each option:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Acetyl CoA not participating in TCA Cycle : Correct. In DKA, the liver produces excess acetyl-CoA, which cannot enter the TCA cycle due to a lack of oxaloacetate (a key intermediate). Instead, acetyl-CoA is converted to ketone bodies.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Acetyl CoA not participating in TCA Cycle</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Increased activity of beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase : Correct. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to ketone bodies (specifically, beta-hydroxybutyrate). Increased activity contributes to ketone body formation.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Increased activity of beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Mobilization of fats from adipose tissue : Correct. In DKA, the body breaks down fat for energy, releasing fatty acids into the bloodstream.
