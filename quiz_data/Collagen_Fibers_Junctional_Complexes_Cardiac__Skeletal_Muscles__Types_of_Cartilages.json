Adjacent to the dense irregular connective tissue is adipose tissue with numerous adipose cells. Tissue preparation dissolves the lipids in individual adipose cells, and cell cytoplasm appears empty with only flattened, dense-staining nuclei in the peripheries. The Dermis of the skin also contains numerous sweat glands. The light-staining regions are the secretory cells of the sweat gland.

Osteoblasts synthesize the osteoid matrix, which calcifies and traps osteoblasts in lacunae as osteocytes. Osteocytes establish cell-to-cell communication via canaliculi that open into blood channels. The primary ossification center forms in the diaphysis, and the secondary center in the epiphysis.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Female nose is slightly smaller and narrower than the male nose The proportions of the nose and face, both from in front and from the side, are of enormous significance to the rhino-plastic surgeon. Aesthetic proportions of the nose vary depending on sex, age, ethnicity, and facial characteristics; however, ranges of normality are described to assist in aesthetic assessment. The female nose is slightly smaller and narrower than the male nose; it is often slightly concave in profile view, with a slightly obtuse nasolabial angle (increased tip rotation). The width of the nose is roughly 70% of e length; the width of the alar base is usually equal to the intercanthal distance. But frontal and parietal eminences are larger in female skulls than male skulls.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The nasal cavity is an irregular space between the roof of the mouth and the cranial base. It is wider below than above and widest and vertically deepest in its central region, divided by a vertical, midline, osseocartilaginous septum. The bony part of the septum reaches the posterior limit of the cavity. The nasal cavity communicates with the paranasal sinuses and opens into the nasopharynx through a pair of oval openings, the posterior nasal apertures, or choanae. The latter is separated by the posterior border of the vomer, and each is limited above by the vaginal process of the medial pterygoid plates, laterally by the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone and the medial pterygoid plate, and below by the horizontal plate of the palatine bone</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Female nose is slightly smaller and narrower relative to the male nose. Option: C. Female nose is slightly smaller relative to the male nose. Option: D. Female nose is narrower relative to the male nose.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Nasal skin is innervated by the infratrochlear and external nasal branches of the nasociliary nerve (ophthalmic division, trigeminal nerve) and the nasal branch of the infraorbital nerve (maxillary division, trigeminal nerve).</p>\n<p></p>",

Spiral or twisted fibers are found in the trapezius, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, supinator, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The muscles can be classified according to the arrangement of their fasciculi into the following groups: Parallel Fasciculi When the fasciculi are parallel to the line of pull, the muscle may be: Quadrilateral (thyrohyoid), Strap-like (sternohyoid and sartorius). Strap-like with tendinous intersections (rectus abdominis). Fusiform (biceps brachii, digastric, etc.). The range of movement in such muscles is maximum Oblique Fasciculi When the fasciculi are oblique to the line of pull, the muscle may be triangular or pennate (feather-like) in construction. This arrangement makes the muscle more powerful, although the range of movement is reduced. Oblique arrangements are of the following types: Triangular, e.g. temporalis, adductor longus. Unipennate, e.g. flexor pollicis longus, extensor digitorum longus, peroneus tertius, palmar interossei Bipennate, e.g. rectus femoris, dorsal interossei, peroneus longus, flexor hallucis longus. Multipennate, e.g., subscapularis, deltoid (acromial fibers). Circumpennate, e.g., tibialis anterior Spiral or Twisted Fasciculi Spiral or twisted fibers are found in the trapezius, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, supinator, etc. In certain muscles, the fasciculi are crossed.
