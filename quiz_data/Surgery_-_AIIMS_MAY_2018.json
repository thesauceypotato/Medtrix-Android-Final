      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Superior mesenteric artery is compressed by the third part of the duodenum at the ligament of Treitz attachment Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is an unusual cause of small-bowel obstruction. Generally, the disorder presents as partial obstruction with postprandial nausea, vomiting, and weight loss Imaging studies suggest compression of the third portion of the duodenum as it passes between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta. The diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopy (confirmation of extrinsic compression in the absence of intrinsic abnormality). CT angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) enable visualization of vascular compression of the duodenum and measurement of aortic and mesenteric distance: Normally, the aorta mesenteric angle and aortic mesenteric distance are 38\u2013650 and 10\u201328 mm, respectively In SMA syndrome, both parameters are reduced, with values of <25\u00b0 and <8 mm Patients most prone to this disorder are those with traumatic spinal cord injury, those with rapid weight loss combined with instrumentation, and those with anatomic variants, such as a short high ligament of Treitz or a low origin of the superior mesenteric artery. Treatment is generally duodenojejunostomy rather than manipulation of the vessels. Strong\u2019s Procedure- Mobilize the DJ flexure and divide the ligament of Treitz Move the D3 away from the narrow aorta mesenteric angle No bowel anastomosis</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) Syndrome Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) Syndrome is when the SMA compresses the third portion of the duodenum as it passes over this part of the intestine. It is also known as Wilkie's syndrome, cast syndrome, and arteriomesenteric duodenal ileus or compression . Three mechanical factors must be present for SMA Syndrome to occur: an abnormally narrow aortomesenteric angle, an abnormally highly fixed transverse duodenum, and an abnormal course of the mesenteric artery continuing inferiorly, anterior to the unyielding vertebral column. SMA Syndrome is most commonly seen in young, asthenic individuals, with women being more commonly affected than men. Rapid weight loss, supine immobilization, rapid height growth, scoliosis, and placement of a body cast are predisposing factors for SMA Syndrome. Symptoms of SMA Syndrome include profound nausea and vomiting, abdominal distention, weight loss, and postprandial epigastric pain, which varies from intermittent to constant depending on the severity of the duodenal obstruction. SMA Syndrome can be diagnosed through a barium upper gastrointestinal series or hypotonic biodemography, demonstrating abrupt or near-total cessation of barium flow from the duodenum to the jejunum. CT may also be helpful in certain instances. Conservative measures are tried initially and have been increasingly successful as definitive treatment for SMA Syndrome. The operative treatment of choice is duodenojejunostomy .</p>\n<p></p>",

If this sentinel node contains tumor cells, then other nodes in the basin may harbor metastasis, and complete nodal dissection should be performed. Regional nodal metastases are highly unlikely if the sentinel node is tumor-free and further nodal resection is not indicated. Tumor status of the axillary lymph nodes is one of the most important prognostic indicators for overall survival in breast cancer .

Beck\u2019s triad for pericardial tamponade (hypotension, distended neck veins, and, rarely, distant or muffled heart tones) is sometimes difficult to demonstrate clinically, especially amid a major resuscitation with concomitant hypovolemia. The most reliable signs of pericardial tamponade are a central venous pressure (CVP) elevated to 15 cm H 2 O or higher associated with hypotension and tachycardia. Pulsus paradoxus may also be present. As with any patient in shock, the physical findings can include dyspnea, agitation, restlessness, cyanosis, tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased mental activity. The cardinal signs of tension pneumothorax are tachycardia, jugular venous distension, and absent breath sounds on the ipsilateral side. These patients can also be dyspneic, agitated, restless, cyanotic, tachycardic, hypotensive, and confused. Absent breath sounds are essential to clinically differentiating these two conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency that can result in respiratory failure or cardiovascular collapse. It can be diagnosed clinically without the need for radiographic confirmation. The symptoms of tension pneumothorax include deviation of the trachea , unilaterally absent or diminished breath sounds, and cardiopulmonary compromise. If these symptoms are present, thoracic decompression should be rapidly performed with a large-bore needle or tube thoracostomy, depending on the availability of equipment and supplies.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In addition to tension pneumothorax, massive hemothorax requires tube thoracostomy to evacuate blood and reexpansion the lung. Severe pulmonary contusion may require aggressive mechanical ventilation with elevated levels of positive end-expiratory pressure. However, to avoid loss of positive end-expiratory pressure, the ventilator should not be repeatedly disconnected for suction or manual ventilation, as oxygenation will only improve with an uninterrupted circuit.</p>\n<p></p>",

Further treatment may include regular surveillance, retroperitoneal radiation therapy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), systemic chemotherapy, or a multimodal therapy approach.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Testicular Tumours: Testicular cancer is an uncommon malignant neoplasm Most cases of primary testicular cancer are germ cell origin (95%); the remainder are predominantly stromal (Leydig cell) or sex cord (Sertoli cell) tumors. Any solid intratesticular mass is likely to represent a malignant germ cell tumor and is typically treated as such unless there is a strong suspicion to the contrary. Risk factors for testicular tumors include cryptorchidism, family history of testicular cancer, and intratubular germ cell neoplasia . Germ cell-derived testicular tumors can be broadly divided into seminoma and nonseminoma germ cell tumors (NSGCTs), approximately 50% for each. The majority of seminomas are classic (85%); the remainder is either anaplastic or spermatocyte seminoma. NSGCTs can be divided into histologic types: embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac or endodermal sinus tumors, choriocarcinoma, teratoma, and mixed germ cell tumors. Treatment : Initial treatment of suspected testicular tumor is radical inguinal orchiectomy , which involves removal of the testicle and spermatic cord at the level of the inguinal ring. Because of the characteristic and well-described lymph drainage of the testicle, there is no role for trans-scrotal biopsy or orchiectomy. If the intrascrotal tissue planes are violated during orchiectomy, the lymphatic drainage can be altered, affecting future treatment. After radical inguinal orchiectomy , the patient should undergo disease staging , including cross-sectional, contrast-enhanced imaging of the abdomen and pelvis, and chest imaging, either chest radiography in low-risk patients or cross-sectional chest imaging in patients with high-risk disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA For seminoma stage IA and IB disease, treatment options in- include surveillance, radiotherapy to the regional (para-aortic) lymph nodes (20 Gy), and one or two cycles of carboplatin-based chemotherapy.59 For seminoma stage IIA and IIB, radiotherapy of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes is standard therapy; for stage IIC or III, platinum-based chemotherapy is standard therapy.59 For NSGCT stage I disease, the options include surveillance, primary RPLND, or cisplatin-based chemotherapy.59 For NSGCT stage IIA, either primary RPLND (in patients with normal levels of tumor markers) or three or four cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy is standard; for location IIB, three or four cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy is common, followed by RPLND or surveillance.59 For NSGCT Stage III, treatment consists of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and when tumor markers normalize, perform RPLND.</p>\n<p></p>",

It was first used on humans in Germany in 1980. Different shock wave generation methods include spark gap, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and micro-expulsive. Shockwaves generated using the spark-gap method must be coordinated with the patient\u2019s electrocardiogram (ECG) to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. Stones can be localized for treatment using either fluoroscopy or USS. This is the standard form of treatment for renal calculi, and stones up to approximately 1.5 cm in size are suitable for this form of treatment. More than one treatment session may be needed to treat the stone, especially if it is sizeable entirely. Prophylactic antibiotics are used to prevent infection, as bacteria often colonize stones. Cystine stones are relatively resistant to ESWL due to their hardness. In addition to infection, ESWL may result in haematuria, parenchymal bleeding, and even perirenal hematoma.

Grossly, the tumor is hard and whitish with macroscopic calcification, necrosis, or cystic changes. It is often multifocal on microscopic examination and is associated with an increased risk of cervical nodal metastases. Papillary Carcinoma of the Thyroid is rarely encapsulated and may invade adjacent structures, although this is rare. Other variants, such as tall cells, insular, and poorly differentiated types, account for about 1% and are associated with a worse prognosis. papillary projections, orphan Annie eye nuclei, and psammoma bodies characterize Papillary Carcinoma of the Thyroid. The diagnosis is based on nuclear characteristics, even without papillary structures. Most patients present with a slow-growing, painless mass in the neck, and dysphagia, dyspnea, and dysphonia are associated with locally advanced invasive disease. Lymph node metastases are common, especially in children and young adults, and maybe the presenting complaint. Diagnosis is established by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the thyroid mass or lymph node. Once diagnosed, a complete neck ultrasound should be performed to evaluate for lymph node metastases. Treatment involves total or near-total thyroidectomy , removing enlarged central neck nodes during surgery. Biopsy-proven lymph node metastases in the lateral neck are managed with modified radical neck dissection.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Medially vas deferens, laterally gonadal vessel, posteriorly peritoneum Most abdominal aortic aneurysms remain asymptomatic until rupture occurs; the risk of fracture increases with the increasing size (diameter) of the aneurysm. A UK national screening program for abdominal aortic aneurysms commenced in 2009, offering an ultrasonography scan to men in their 65th year. In recent years, there has been much discussion regarding the optimal way to treat an abdominal aortic aneurysm with open surgical repair and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), having vocal advocates in the scientific literature.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The gonadal vessels and the iliac vain form a triangle with its apex upward; in the area of the iliac vessels; this anatomical area, called \u201ctriangle of doom,\u201d as well as the so-called \u201ctriangle of pain,\u201d located between the anterior superior iliac spine and the gonadal vessels, warrants particular attention Familiarity with these two regions is crucial during laparoscopic inguinal hernioplasty because they are areas with high potential for severe complications such as trans operative vascular lesions or painful postoperative sequelae The triangle of doom Borders Medially: By the vas deferens Laterally : By the vessels of the spermatic cord Inferiorly : Peritoneal fold Contents: The external iliac vessels Deep circumflex iliac vein Femoral nerve Genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve. The triangle of pain Borders Inferolaterally : Ilio-pubic tract Superomedially : Gonadal vessels Contents : The lateral femoral cutaneous Femoral branch of the genitofemoral Femoral nerves. The circle of death is a vascular continuation formed by the common iliac, internal iliac, obturator, inferior epigastric, and external iliac vessels.</p>\n<p></p>",
