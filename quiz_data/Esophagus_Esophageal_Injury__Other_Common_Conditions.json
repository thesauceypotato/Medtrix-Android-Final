      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Esophageal perforation This patient most likely has an iatrogenic esophageal perforation , which is associated with the esophagogastroduodenoscopy that was performed the day before symptom onset. Iatrogenic esophageal perforation usually occurs within 24 hours of upper endoscopy. Fever may occur as a result of a secondary infection of the mediastinum or peritoneum. Extra edge: Spontaneous rupture usually occurs on the left posterolateral side of the distal esophagus into the left pleural cavity or just above the gastroesophageal junction. These patients are typically male (85%), 40 to 60 years of age, and have a history of recent emesis. Common in Alcoholics. Clinical Features : Mackler\u2019s triad of thoracic pain, vomiting, and cervical subcutaneous emphysema is seen in spontaneous esophageal perforation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Esophageal perforation is a rare but serious condition that can be caused by both iatrogenic and spontaneous factors. Iatrogenic perforation is the most common type and can be caused by various diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as endoscopy, dilation, or stent placement. Spontaneous perforation is less common and can be caused by vomiting, foreign body ingestion, or underlying esophageal pathology. The most common site of iatrogenic perforation is the cervical esophagus, while spontaneous perforation typically occurs in the distal esophagus.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Pneumothorax typically presents with chest pain and may also be accompanied by subcutaneous emphysema with crepitus. However, the pain is usually described as a sharp pain that increases with inspiration. Additionally, this patient does not seem to be in significant respiratory distress since his oxygen saturation is within the normal range (98%), all of which favours another diagnosis. Option: B. Acute pancreatitis is associated with a dull pain that radiates to the back. Fever also commonly occurs and there may even be ST-T changes. Although this patient presents with radiating chest pain to the back, fever, and nonspecific ST-T changes, his crepitus over the thorax shortly following the endoscopic procedure favours a different diagnosis. Option: D . Patients with aortic dissection typically present with sudden, severe, \u201ctearing\u201d chest pain, radiating to the back and potential symptoms of cardiac tamponade (e.g., marked jugular venous distention, hypotension). Another important feature of aortic dissection is asymmetric blood pressure and pulses. Although this patient presents with chest pain radiating to the back, he has very similar blood pressure in his upper and lower extremities. His symptoms also occurred shortly after an endoscopic procedure, which makes another diagnosis more likely.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Treatment for esophageal perforation typically involves surgical repair, which includes debridement of devitalized tissue, primary mucosal repair, and closure of the muscular layer. Tissue reinforcement with a vascular pedicle or antireflux procedure may also be used to buttress the repair. The overall mortality rate for esophageal perforation ranges from 10% to 40%, with higher rates associated with delayed diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n<p></p>",

To avoid the risk of barium extravasation into the pleura or mediastinum, gastrografin (a water-soluble contrast agent) is preferred over barium. If the initial esophagogram is negative, a barium study may follow. Chest CT can also aid in diagnosis by revealing mediastinal air and fluid at the perforation site. Endoscopy may be necessary if the esophagogram is negative or if surgery is planned. Treatment involves immediate resuscitation, securing the airway, administering intravenous fluids, and starting broad-spectrum antibiotics.</p>\n<p></p>",

The presence of heartburn and dysphagia raises suspicion about gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ). However, symptoms of GERD usually improve with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. GERD commonly affects the distal esophagus, which may be normal or show evidence of esophagitis; endoscopic evaluation of the upper esophagus will often be normal. Other endoscopic findings in individuals with longstanding GERD may reveal esophageal ulcers, strictures, Barrett esophagus, and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma, none of which are present in this patient. Option: B. Dysphagia and heartburn refractory to proton pump inhibitors may raise suspicion for herpes (HSV) esophagitis . However, HSV esophagitis is usually present in individuals who are immunocompromised (e.g., AIDS, immunosuppressant medication use). Moreover, endoscopic evaluation of HSV esophagitis would show vesicles and multiple small superficial round/ovoid ulcers in the mid-esophagus that may coalesce to form diffuse superficial ulcers, which are not seen here. Option: C. Dysphagia and heartburn refractory to proton pump inhibitors may raise suspicion for candida esophagitis . However, candida esophagitis is typically present in individuals who are immunocompromised (e.g., AIDS, immunosuppressant medication use). Although this patient's inhaled corticosteroid increases the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis, it is only rarely associated with esophageal candidiasis.

Heavy alcohol use is the most important predisposing condition for Mallory-Weiss syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mallory-Weiss syndrome Causes: Mallory-Weiss tears occur due to forceful vomiting, retching, coughing, or straining. Forceful contraction of the abdominal wall against an unrelaxed cardia causes mucosal laceration of proximal cardia due to an increase in intragastric pressure. The tear is partial thickness, extending through the mucosa and submucosa , resulting in disruption of gastric mucosa high on the lesser curve at cardia ( just below GE junction). Clinical Features: Common in alcoholic patients after a period of intense retching and vomiting after binge drinking. Cause of up to 15% of all severe upper GI bleeds . Arterial bleeding (usually from the left gastric artery), is usually painless and rarely associated with massive bleeding. The overall mortality rate is 3-4% , with the greatest risk for massive haemorrhage in alcoholic patients with preexisting portal hypertension. Diagnosis: Usually diagnosed by history. Endoscopy is used to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. A Dieulafoy lesion manifests with signs of upper GI bleeding, including hematemesis and epigastric pain. This rare condition is typically not preceded by multiple episodes of vomiting, and the haemorrhage would likely be more severe, making the diagnosis unlikely. Option: B. Esophageal varices are the most common cause of esophageal bleeding. Heavy drinking increases the risk of alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis, which may eventually lead to the formation of esophageal varices and subsequent variceal bleeding. Variceal bleeding usually manifests with sudden onset of hematemesis, which is seen here. However, this patient had multiple episodes of non-bloody vomiting before the bleeding started and has only been vomiting a small amount of blood, whereas variceal bleeding would typically manifest with severe haemorrhage. Because his physical examination did not show any signs of liver disease or portal hypertension, a different diagnosis is more likely. Option: C. The patient's history of epigastric pain following multiple episodes of vomiting due to heavy alcohol use should raise suspicion for a transmural tear of the lower esophagus, as seen in Boerhaave syndrome. However, hematemesis is not characteristic of this condition. In addition, patients with Boerhaave syndrome typically present with excruciating retrosternal chest pain rather than epigastric pain and can develop dyspnea, crepitus of palpation of the chest wall (due to mediastinal emphysema), and signs of mediastinitis, none of which is seen here.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Supportive therapy is often all that is necessary because 90% of bleeding episodes are self-limited, and the mucosa often heals within 72 hours. Persistent bleeding is managed by endoscopic electrocoagulation or endoscopic therapy with injection , angiographic embolization, or surgery (laparotomy and high gastrotomy with oversewing of the linear tear) if the above manoeuvres fail. Recurrent bleeding from a Mallory-Weiss tear is uncommon. Note: A Sengstaken-Blakemore tube is contraindicated in Mallory-Weiss syndrome as it will not stop bleeding due to arterial pressure.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Mucosal lacerations at the Gastroesophageal junction Mucosal lacerations at the gastroesophageal junction are found in Mallory-Weiss syndrome, which is the cause of this patient's epigastric pain, forceful hematemesis, and unstable vitals (indicating hypovolemic shock). Conditions associated with frequent forceful vomiting, such as this patient's presumed bulimia nervosa, predispose to Mallory-Weiss syndrome. Other predisposing conditions include alcohol abuse disorder, hiatal hernia, and GERD. Russell\u2019s sign is seen in patients with bulimia nervosa : Erosion/pigmentation on Lnuclies due to repeated attempts to induce vomiting. The clinical presentation of the chest and epigastric pain, vomiting, and hematemesis with dental enamel erosion and calluses on the dorsal aspect of her right hand and Russell's sign (caused by repeated knuckle abrasions from inducing vomiting) suggest the diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. Further evaluation with upper endoscopy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of damage to the esophagus and stomach. The most likely finding, in this case, is mucosal lacerations at the gastroesophageal junction, also known as Mallory-Weiss tears, which are caused by forceful vomiting.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mallory-Weiss tear Longitudinal tear at the GOJ caused by repetitive and strenuous vomiting. Lesions can occur without causing bleeding. When it causes haematemesis, the lesion may be difficult to see as it is just below the GOJ and hard to spot for inexperienced endoscopists. Sometimes these lesions continue to bleed and need surgery.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Dilated veins in the esophageal submucosa result from esophageal varices secondary to cirrhosis or Dieulafoy's lesion. Both conditions can also cause haemorrhage, hematemesis, retrosternal or epigastric pain, and shock, as seen in this patient. However, neither condition is associated with bulimia nervosa, and given a lack of signs of cirrhosis (e.g., jaundice, ascites) and the rarity of Dieulafoy's lesions, another diagnosis is more likely. Option: B. Transmural rupture of the distal esophagus, or Boerhaave syndrome, can present with hematemesis, severe retrosternal or epigastric pain, and can lead to shock, as in this patient. However, patients classically have crepitus of the chest due to subcutaneous emphysema and a pneumomediastinum on CXR. Option: C. A clean-based gastric ulcer, suggestive of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), can also present with hematemesis and epigastric pain. However, given the acute nature of this patient's pain and forceful vomiting, as well as a history negative for PUD risk factors (e.g., NSAID or corticosteroid use, smoking, no previous heartburn), this diagnosis is unlikely.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Persistent bleeding in Mallory Weiss Syndrome can be managed through different methods, including: Endoscopic electrocoagulation or endoscopic therapy with injection Angiographic embolization Surgery, which involves laparotomy and high gastrotomy with oversewing of the linear tear, only if the above methods fail.</p>\n<p></p>",

Portal hypertension leads to dilated submucosal esophageal veins that can erode and bleed profusely.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Esophageal varices Portal hypertension (PHT) is primarily associated with the development of gastroesophageal (GE) varices , with the major blood supply to these varices being the anterior branch of the left gastric or coronary vein . Variceal bleeding is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality associated with PHT. Approximately 30% of patients with compensated cirrhosis and 60% of patients with decompensated cirrhosis have esophageal varices, and one-third of all patients with varices experience variceal bleeding. Each episode of bleeding is associated with a 20-30% risk of mortality , and 70% of patients who survive the initial bleed will experience recurrent variceal haemorrhage within one year if left untreated. Current measures aimed at preventing variceal bleeding include abstaining from alcohol to improve liver function, avoiding aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and administering nonselective beta-blockers such as propranolol or nadolol.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A.

Octreotide is preferred for the initial management of acute variceal bleeding.</p>\n<p></p>",
