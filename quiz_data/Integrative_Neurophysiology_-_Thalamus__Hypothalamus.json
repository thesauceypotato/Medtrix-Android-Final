When body fluid is highly diluted, the secretion of ADH is suppressed to enhance the excretion of water and to regulate total body water. Control of renal excretion of water is vested mainly in the supraoptic nuclei. When the body fluids become too concentrated, the neurons of these areas become stimulated. Nerve fibers from these neurons project downward through the infundibulum of the hypothalamus into the posterior pituitary gland, where the nerve endings secrete the hormone antidiuretic hormone (also called vasopressin). This hormone is then absorbed into the blood and transported to the kidneys, where it acts on the collecting tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys to cause increased reabsorption of water.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The released acetylcholine acts on postsynaptic nicotinic receptors. Acetylcholine activates mainly two types of receptors, which are called muscarinic and nicotinic receptors . The reason for these names is that muscarine, a poison from toadstools, activates only muscarinic receptors and will not activate nicotinic receptors, whereas nicotine activates only nicotinic receptors.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Acetylcholine activates both of them. Muscarinic receptors, which use G proteins as their signaling mechanism, are found on all effector cells that are stimulated by the postganglionic cholinergic neurons of either the parasympathetic nervous system or the sympathetic system. Nicotinic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels found in autonomic ganglia at the synapses between the preganglionic and postganglionic neurons of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. (Nicotinic receptors are also present at many non-autonomic nerve endings\u2014for example, at the neuromuscular junctions in skeletal muscle).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Acetylcholine is synthesized by the action of choline-o-acetyltransferase on choline and acetyl coenzyme A. Option: B. Release of neurotransmitters is triggered when voltage-sensitive calcium channels open to allow the influx of calcium. Option: D. Choline is recycled by being taken back up into the presynaptic terminal.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Acetylcholine is synthesized in the terminal endings and varicosities of the cholinergic nerve fibers, where it is stored in vesicles in highly concentrated form until it is released. Once acetylcholine is secreted into tissue by a cholinergic nerve ending, it persists in the tissue for a few seconds while it performs its nerve signal transmitter function. Then it is split into an acetate ion and choline, catalyzed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which is bound with collagen and glycosaminoglycans in the local connective tissue. This mechanism is the same as that for acetylcholine signal transmission and subsequent acetylcholine destruction that occurs at the neuromuscular junctions of skeletal nerve fibers. The choline that is formed is then transported back into the terminal nerve ending, where it is used again and again for the synthesis of new acetylcholine.</p>\n<p></p>",
