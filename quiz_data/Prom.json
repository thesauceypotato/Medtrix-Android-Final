      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Respiratory Distress Syndrome Rds (respiratory distress syndrome), nec ( necrotizing enterocolitis), sepsis, bpd (bronchopulmonary dysplasia), ivh( intraventricular hemorrhage) and pulmonary hypoplasia are some of the common neonatal complications of PROM.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>CAUSES OF PROM In the majority, the causes are not known. The possible causes are: Increased friability of the membranes; Decreased tensile strength of the membranes; Polyhydramnios; Cervical incompetence; Multiple pregnancies; Infection-Chorioamnionitis, urinary tract infection and lower genital tract infection; Cervical length <2.5 cm; Prior preterm labor and Low BMI (< 19 kg/m\u00b2).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option A. Fetal complications of PROM are infection and fetal distress due to umbilical cord compression. Option B. Maternal complications of prom Placental abruption, sepsis and maternal death. Option C. Chorioamnionitis, maternal complication</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>DANGERS AND COMPLICATIONS OF PROM DANGERS: The implications are less severe when the rupture occurs near term than earlier in pregnancy. In terms of PROM, labor starts in 80-90% of cases within 24 hours. PROM is one of the essential causes of preterm labor and prematurity; The chance of ascending infection increases if labor fails to start within 24 hours. Liquor gets infected (chorioamnionitis), and fetal infection supervenes; Cord prolapse, mainly when associated with malpresentation; Continuous escape of liquor for a long duration may lead to dry labor; Placental abruption; Fetal pulmonary hypoplasia, especially in preterm PROM, is a real threat when associated with oligohydramnios; Neonatal sepsis, RDS, IVH and NEC in preterm PROM; Perinatal morbidities (cerebral palsy) are high. Maternal complications of PROM : Chorioamnionitis, placental abruption, retained placenta, endometritis, maternal sepsis and even death.</p>\n<p></p>",
