It descends through the psoas major muscle and emerges from the lateral border of the muscle. It then divides into two branches: The genital branch, which supplies sensory fibers to the skin of the mons pubis, labia majora or scrotum, and cremaster muscle in males.</li><li>\u2022 The femoral branch, which passes laterally over the iliacus muscle and descends along the anterior surface of the psoas major muscle. It supplies sensory fibers to the skin of the femoral triangle and the upper anterior thigh.</li><li>\u2022 In addition to its sensory functions, the genitofemoral nerve also provides motor innervation to the cremaster muscle in males, which raises the testes towards the body in response to cold or other stimuli. Dysfunction of the genitofemoral nerve can lead to sensory loss or motor weakness in the areas it innervates.</li><li>\u2022 During femoral vein catheterization, local anesthesia is typically administered in the area inferior to the inguinal ligament and close to the femoral pulse.

Femoral nerve: The femoral nerve is the largest branch of the lumbar plexus and arises from the dorsal divisions of the ventral rami of the L2-L4 spinal nerves. It descends through the iliopsoas muscle and enters the femoral triangle, lateral to the femoral vessels. The femoral nerve primarily supplies muscles in the anterior compartment of the thigh and provides sensory innervation to the anterior thigh and medial leg. While it is in close proximity to the femoral vein, it is not the primary nerve targeted during femoral vein catheterization.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Femoral nerve:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh: This nerve originates from the L2-L3 levels of the lumbar plexus. It travels inferiorly and exits the pelvis under the inguinal ligament, close to the anterior superior iliac spine, to supply the skin on the lateral aspect of the thigh. While it is near the inguinal ligament, its location is more lateral compared to the site of femoral vein catheterization, making it less likely to be affected.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Ilioinguinal nerve: The ilioinguinal nerve arises from the L1 level of the lumbar plexus. It travels through the inguinal canal and provides sensory innervation to the skin of the groin, mons pubis, and scrotum or labium majus. The course and distribution of this nerve make it less relevant for femoral vein catheterization, which occurs more medially and inferiorly.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
