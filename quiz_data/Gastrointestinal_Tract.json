Ageing, connective tissue disease and elevated intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., central obesity, pregnancy, tight garments, chronic straining) will further aggravate the hernia. An acid pocket is an area of unbuffered gastric acid that accumulates in the proximal stomach after meals and serves as a reservoir for acid reflux.

They are mostly found incidentally as a submucosal mass on endoscopy as seen in the image, but may produce compressive symptoms when large. EUS shows a hypoechoic mass arising from the muscularis propria or the submucosal layer. They rarely become malignant; however, resection is indicated if enlarging on serial assessment. Small leiomyomas can be enucleated with a thoracoscopic approach, keeping the mucosa intact. Pre-operative biopsy or EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is relatively contraindicated as the consequent scarring will increase the chance of breaching the mucosa during enucleation. Endoscopic resection is possible using submucosal tunnelling endoscopic resection (STER); this creates a mucosal opening a short distance from the leiomyoma (3\u20135 cm proximally), allowing a submucosal tunnel to reach the lesion.</li><li>\u2022 Leiomyomas are the most common solid benign tumours of the esophagus .

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is relatively rare in CD, compared with UC. Gallstones are common, as an inflamed or absent (because of resection) terminal ileum leads to reduced absorption of bile salts. Amyloidosis is common but is rarely symptomatic. Each patient with CD should have their disease phenotype (manifestations) classified according to the Montreal classification. This is important as it allows an overview of disease progression in the individual patient over time, and enables group comparisons and evaluations. The Montreal classification specifies age at diagnosis, behaviour and disease location. Perianal CD is distressing and often debilitating for patients. The most common presentation is with a perianal abscess : perianal swelling, redness and pain, followed by discharge of pus or fecal drainage to perianal skin or vagina, implying fistulae. Surgical resection will not cure CD. Surgery, therefore, focuses on managing the complications of the disease.

The resultant increase in capillary pressure leads to impaired local perfusion and, once the arterial supply is impaired, hemorrhagic infarction occurs. As the viability of the bowel is compromised, translocation and systemic exposure to anaerobic organisms and endotoxin occurs. Localized tenderness indicates impending or established ischemia . The development of peritonism or peritonitis indicates impending or established infarction and/or perforation. In cases of large bowel obstruction, it is important to elicit these findings in the right iliac fossa as the caecum is most vulnerable to ischaemia . The presence of shock suggests underlying ischemia. In impending or established strangulation, pain is never completely absent.

C) Adhesive obstruction - CECT abdomen</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Paralytic ileus - Put a NG tube. Paralytic ileus is characterized by decreased bowel motility without mechanical obstruction . Patients typically present with decreased or absent bowel sounds and lack of peristalsis . Inserting a nasogastric (NG) tube for decompression may be indicated to relieve abdominal distension and vomiting. However, in this case, the presence of a step ladder pattern of air-fluid levels on X-ray suggests a mechanical obstruction rather than paralytic ileus.

It is more common in females in the fourth and fifth decades and usually presents acutely with the classic features of obstruction. Ischaemia is common . In 25% of cases, examination may reveal a palpable tympanic swelling in the midline or left side of the abdomen. The volvulus typically results in the caecum lying in the left upper quadrant. Radiological abnormalities are identifiable in nearly all patients but are often non-specific, with caecal dilatation (98\u2013100%), a single air\u2013fluid level (72\u201388%), small bowel dilatation (42\u201355%) and absence of gas in distal colon (82\u201391%) reported as the most common abnormalities. A barium enema may be used to confirm the diagnosis if there are no concerns about ischaemia, with an absence of barium in the caecum and a bird\u2019s beak deformity . CT scanning is now the imaging of choice . At operation the volvulus is frequently found to be ischaemic and needs resection. If viable, the volvulus should be reduced. Sometimes, this can only be achieved after decompression of the caecum using a needle. Further management consists of either resection or fixation of the caecum to the right iliac fossa (cecopexy) and/or a cecostomy in those considered unfit for resection. Recurrence of volvulus after cecopexy has been reported in up to 40% of cases.</li><li>\u27a4 Cecal volvulus may occur as part of volvulus neonatorum or de novo and is usually a clockwise twist .
