Lymphatic drainage of Tongue</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. Occipital Lymph Node The occipital group of nodes drains to the sternocleidomastoid nodes or accessory nodes via efferent vessels. The superficial and deep occipital lymph nodes receive lymphatic drainage from the posterior aspect of the scalp, the skin of the upper neck, and a portion of the deep layers of the neck which borders on the occipital region. Option C. Deep cervical lymph node Deep cervical nodal groups drain the efferent lymphatics from the occipital, retro-auricular, occipital, and parietal scalp nodes. It receives direct drainage from the skin of the lateral and posterior neck and shoulder, the nasopharynx, the oropharynx, and the thyroid gland . Option D .

Circumvallate Papillae Circumvallate papillae : Also known as vallate papillae, 7-11 of these are located on the backside of your tongue, anterior to sulcus terminalis containing over 100 taste buds each . Option B. Filiform papillae Filiform papillae are found in large numbers across the tongue\u2019s surface. They are cone-shaped structures that don\u2019t contain taste buds, so have no taste function. Each papilla has brush-like structures called secondary papillae projecting from its tip. They are abrasive giving the tongue a cleaning, rasping action and helping grip food. Filiform papillae give the tongue a velvety or furry appearance. Option D. Passavant\u2019s ridge The Passavant cushion or ridge is a small prominence in the posterior pharynx, formed from a focal bulge of the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscles during swallowing. The \"cushion\" opposes the soft palate during the act of swallowing and is part of the seal between the soft palate and pharynx that prevents nasopharyngeal reflux.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The tongue and the floor of the mouth are supplied chiefly by the lingual artery, which arises from the anterior surface of the external carotid artery.
