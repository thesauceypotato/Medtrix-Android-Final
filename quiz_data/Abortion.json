Ecobolics: They increase uterine contraction but do not relax or dilate the cervical canal and external os, which is necessary to expel the Foetus. Ergot is most commonly used and has a uterine action which increases as pregnancy advances, but its toxic circulatory side effects result in arterial spasms and gangrene of the extremities. It frequently fails during the earlier months of pregnancy. Option: C. Abortifacient Drugs: Every common drug has been used at some time in an attempt to produce criminal abortion. They either produce a congestion of the uterine mucosa and then uterine bleeding, followed by contraction of the uterine muscle and expulsion of the Foetus, or they cause the uterine contraction by stimulating the myometrium directly. There is no drug which when taken by the mouth causes abortion without endangering the life of the woman.</p>\n<p></p>",

Criminal Abortion: A criminal abortion is the induced destruction and expulsion of the Foetus from the womb of the mother unlawfully, i.e., when there is no therapeutic indication for the operation. It is resorted to mostly by widows and unmarried women. It is usually carried out before the third month. A case of criminal abortion is investigated only when the woman dies, and rarely when someone gives the information to the police Option: C. Unsafe abortion means abortion is not provided through approved facilities, and/or persons Option: D. Justifiable or Therapeutic Abortion: Abortion is justifiable only when it is done in good faith to save the life of the woman if it is materially endangered by the continuance of the pregnancy</p>\n<p></p>",
