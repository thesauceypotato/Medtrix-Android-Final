Because it lacks 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, the enzyme that converts pregnenolone to progesterone (the initial step in both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>This steroid is metabolized further to estrogen and androgen by the placenta. During fetal life, the adrenal cortex consists of a thin subcapsular rim, which eventually gives rise to the adult cortex, and a thick inner fetal cortex, which constitutes 80% of the gland.

Cortisol : The adrenal gland secretes steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone. Option B. Corticosterone is the hormone of the pituitary adrenocortical axis secreted by the adrenal cortex. Option D. Pregnenolone is a hormone naturally produced in the body by the adrenal gland. Pregnenolone is also made from cholesterol.</p>\n<p></p>",

They are gluconeogenic themselves, but their role is mainly permissive. In adrenal insufficiency, the blood glucose is normal as long as food intake is maintained, but fasting precipitates hypoglycemia and collapses. The plasma-glucose-lowering effect of insulin is greatly enhanced in patients with adrenal insufficiency. In animals with experimental diabetes, adrenalectomy markedly ameliorates diabetes. The major diabetogenic effects are - an increase in protein catabolism with increased gluconeogenesis in the liver; increased hepatic gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis; and a decrease in peripheral glucose utilization relative to the blood insulin level that may be due to inhibition of glucose phosphorylation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Rest options are inappropriate because Glucocorticoids maintain the intracellular concentrations of many of the enzymes needed to carry out gluconeogenesis through effects on transcription. <br</p>\n<p></p>",

Most of it is bound to transcortin, a corticosteroid-specific a2 globulin, and the rest to albumin. Option B. This high degree of binding to plasma proteins slows the elimination of cortisol. Therefore, cortisol has a longer half-life of 60 to 90 minutes. Option C. Since only about 60% of aldosterone is in bound form, it has a relatively short half-life of about 20 minutes.</p>\n<p></p>",

This mobilization increases the concentration of free fatty acids in the plasma, which also increases their utilization of energy, causing lipolysis. However, in chronic states cortisol has more lipogenic effect than lipolytic, causing central obesity and buffalo hump. Effect on protein: Exerts a catabolic effect and causes proteolysis Effect on water and electrolytes: Sodium water retention and diuresis Effect on appetite: Increases the appetite and food intake by inducing the synthesis of neuropeptide-Y. Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects: Induce the synthesis of lipocortin, an inhibitor of phospholipase A2. Inhibit the release of histamine and serotonin. Inhibit the production of IL-2 and T lymphocytes, and depress cellular immunity.
