C) 1 and 2</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Erythropoietin is a hormone primarily produced by the kidneys and to a lesser extent by the liver. In a healthy individual, the majority of erythropoietin (approximately 90%) is produced by the kidney, specifically by peritubular interstitial fibroblasts. These cells respond to hypoxia (low oxygen levels) by increasing the production of erythropoietin, which then stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. The liver also contributes to erythropoietin production, particularly through sinusoidal cells, although it accounts for only about 10% of the hormone's production under normal conditions.</li><li>\u2022 In certain pathological conditions, such as in some types of anemia (e.g., thalassemia major), the spleen may take on a role in erythropoietin production to compensate for the body's increased need for red blood cells. However, this is not the case in healthy individuals, which is why the spleen and other organs like the lung are not considered significant sources of erythropoietin under normal physiological conditions.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 3 and 4 : While the spleen can contribute in pathological states, it is not a primary source under normal conditions, and the lung does not contribute to erythropoietin production.</li><li>\u2022 3 and 4</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Erythropoietin is primarily produced by the kidneys, with the liver contributing to a lesser extent.

This autoregulation relies mainly on the myogenic response and tubuloglomerular feedback mechanisms. The myogenic response involves the inherent ability of the vascular smooth muscle cells in the afferent arterioles to contract when stretched by increased blood pressure, thereby regulating blood flow. Tubuloglomerular feedback, on the other hand, involves the macula densa cells sensing changes in sodium chloride concentration in the distal tubule, which then modulates afferent arteriolar tone to maintain GFR.

NREM Sleep : Prolactin levels naturally rise during sleep, especially during the deeper stages of NREM sleep, due to reduced dopamine activity, which normally inhibits prolactin secretion.

A) At eight weeks the embryo is bipotent</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 At eight weeks of gestation, the embryo is no longer bipotent. The term \"bipotent\" refers to the embryo's capability to develop into either male or female structures, which is true up until about the sixth week of development. By the eighth week, sexual differentiation is already underway, with the influence of the SRY gene causing the gonads to differentiate into testes in 46XY embryos. This differentiation results in a shift away from bipotency, making the embryo committed to developing male characteristics.</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Wolffian duct develops into epididymis and vas deferens on either side of the body : This statement is true.

Wolffian duct develops into epididymis and vas deferens on either side of the body</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Mullerian inhibiting substance inhibits Mullerian duct : This statement is true. Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS), also known as anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), is produced by Sertoli cells in the testes and inhibits the development of the Mullerian ducts, which would otherwise develop into female reproductive structures such as the uterine tubes and uterus.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Mullerian inhibiting substance inhibits Mullerian duct</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Dihydrotestosterone leads to the development of secondary sexual characters and external genitalia : This statement is true.

Elastin fibres</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Ligamentum flavum has high levels of elastin fibres.</li><li>\u2022 The ventral portions of the laminae of nearby vertebrae are connected by a network of ligaments called the Ligament flava. They make up a portion of the posterior surface of the spinal canal and primarily consist of elastic tissue. Because it contains a lot of elastin, it can be stretched by 80% without suffering any harm. The ligamentum flava helps with extension back to the anatomical position by helping to prevent laminae separation during flexion.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Type 1 collagen: Collagen is the primary structural protein, among the different types of collagen, Type 1 collagen is the most abundant. It's found in many tissues including skin, tendons, internal organs, and the organic part of bones. Its primary function is to provide tensile strength to these tissues. It forms strong fibers and is responsible for the strength of the tissue. However, while present in many areas of the body, Type 1 collagen is not the predominant component of the ligamentum flavum.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Type 1 collagen:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Type 2 collagen: Type 2 collagen is primarily found in cartilaginous tissues. Its main function is to provide resistance against intermittent pressure, making it ideal for cartilaginous structures like the intervertebral discs, hyaline cartilage, and the vitreous humor of the eye. Given that ligamentum flavum is not a cartilaginous structure, Type 2 collagen is not its predominant component.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Type 2 collagen:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Reticular fibers: Reticular fibers are a type of fiber in connective tissue composed of Type 3 collagen. These fibers form a mesh-like framework in various organs such as the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. They provide a supportive framework for these and other organs. While they are present in various parts of the body, they are not the main component of the ligamentum flavum.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Reticular fibers:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The ligamentum flavum, which connects the laminae of adjacent vertebrae, contains a high concentration of elastin fibers, which allows the ligament to stretch during spine flexion and then return to its original shape when the spine is extended.</li><li>\u27a4 This characteristic helps maintain the stability and alignment of the vertebral column. Thus, among the given options, elastin fibers are the predominant component of the ligamentum flavum.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Decorticate rigidity, often seen in patients with damage above the brainstem, such as cerebral hemisphere lesions, is characterized by flexion of the upper limbs at the elbows and extension of the lower limbs. This posturing results from the disruption of the corticospinal tract while sparing the brainstem pathways that facilitate flexor muscle activity in the arms and extensor muscle activity in the legs. Decorticate rigidity typically occurs due to intracranial hemorrhage, brain injury, tumors, or abscesses affecting the cerebral cortex or descending pathways, leading to loss of inhibitory control over the spinal reflexes that regulate posture.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Decorticate rigidity involves complete relaxation of all muscles due to brainstem injury. This statement is incorrect as decorticate rigidity involves abnormal posturing with flexion and extension patterns, not muscle relaxation. Brainstem injury often leads to decerebrate rigidity rather than decorticate rigidity.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Decorticate rigidity involves complete relaxation of all muscles due to brainstem injury.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Decorticate rigidity is characterized by flaccid paralysis of all four limbs. Flaccid paralysis indicates a complete loss of muscle tone, which is not seen in decorticate rigidity. Instead, decorticate rigidity involves specific abnormal flexor and extensor postures due to upper brain dysfunction.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Decorticate rigidity is characterized by flaccid paralysis of all four limbs.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Decorticate rigidity is the result of increased inhibition from the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are involved in movement control, but decorticate rigidity is specifically related to damage affecting the corticospinal tract and the loss of cortical inhibitory input, not an increase in inhibition from the basal ganglia.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Decorticate rigidity is the result of increased inhibition from the basal ganglia.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Decorticate rigidity is a condition characterized by abnormal posturing with flexion of the upper limbs and extension of the lower limbs due to damage above the brainstem, such as from intracranial hemorrhage or brain injury.
