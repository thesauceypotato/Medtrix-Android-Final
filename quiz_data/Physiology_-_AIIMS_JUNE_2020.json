These organelles harbor high concentrations of oxidative enzymes such as catalase and urate oxidase and are a major site of oxygen utilization. Lysosome : One of the key organelles involved in digestion and waste removal is the lysosome. Lysosomes are organelles that contain digestive enzymes. They digest excess or worn out organelles, food particles, and engulfed viruses or bacteria.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Arterial wall Compliance Pulse pressure increases with age due to decreased arterial wall compliance. With advancing age, there is an increase in systolic blood pressure. Whilst diastolic blood pressure falls after 60 years of age due to increased arterial stiffness (decreased compliance). As a result of these two changes, pulse pressure increases .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>As the left ventricle ejects blood into the aorta, the aortic pressure increases. The greater the stroke volume, the greater the change in pressure during ejection. The maximal change in aortic pressure during systole (from the time the aortic valve opens until the peak aortic pressure is attained (see Cardiac Cycle) represents the aortic pulse pressure, which is defined as the systolic pressure minus the diastolic pressure. For example, if the systolic pressure is 130 mmHg and the diastolic pressure is 85 mmHg, then the pulse pressure is 45 mmHg. Pulse Pressure = Systolic Pressure \u2500 Diastolic Pressure The rise in aortic pressure from its diastolic to systolic value is determined by the compliance of the aorta as well as the ventricular stroke volume . In the arterial system, the aorta has the highest compliance, due in part to a relatively greater proportion of elastin fibers versus smooth muscle and collagen. This serves the important function of dampening the pulsatile output of the left ventricle, thereby reducing the pulse pressure (systolic minus diastolic arterial pressure). If the aorta were a rigid tube, the pulse pressure would be very high. Because the aorta is compliant, as blood is ejected into the aorta, the walls of the aorta expand to accommodate the increase in blood volume. As the aorta expands, the increase in pressure is determined by the compliance of the aorta at that particular range of volumes. The more compliant the aorta, the smaller the pressure change during ventricular ejection (i.e., smaller pulse pressure) (see Image ). Therefore, aortic compliance is a major determinant, along with stroke volume, of the pulse pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>A highly compliant aorta (i.e., less stiff) has a smaller pulse pressure for a given stroke volume into the aorta. A larger stroke volume produces a larger pulse pressure at any given compliance. Aortic compliance decreases with age due to structural changes, thereby producing age-dependent increases in pulse pressure. For a given stroke volume, compliance determines pulse pressure and not mean aortic pressure. However, because vessels display dynamic compliance, increasing the rate of ventricular ejection (as occurs with increased ventricular inotropy) will increase the pulse pressure compared to the same volume ejected at a lower rate. Therefore higher pulse pressure corresponds to lower arterial wall compliance. Relationship between change in volume (\u2206V) and pressure in aortas having high and low compliance. For a given stroke volume (\u2206V), aortic pulse pressure (double arrow) is increased when compliance is reduced.</p>\n<p></p>",

It can be of 2 types: Convergence from a single source Convergence from multiple sources The importance of convergence is that neurons are almost never excited by an action potential from a single input terminal. However, action potentials converging on the neuron from multiple terminals provide enough spatial summation to bring the neuron to the threshold required for discharge.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B. Feed forward excitation . Allows one neuron to relay information to its neighbor.  Long chains of these can be used to propagate information through the nervous system. Option: A. Feed forward inhibition . A presynaptic cell excites an inhibitory interneuron (an interneuron is a neuron interposed between two neurons) and that inhibitory interneuron then inhibits the next follower cell.  This is a way of shutting down or limiting excitation in a downstream neuron in a neural circuit. Option: D. Convergence/Divergence . One postsynaptic cell receives convergent input from a number of different presynaptic cells and any individual neuron can make divergent connections to many different postsynaptic cells.  Divergence allows one neuron to communicate with many other neurons in a network.  Convergence allows a neuron to receive input from many neurons in a network.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>As in the question, a single neuron is receiving inputs from several neurons, the type of circuit is a convergence circuit Lateral inhibition . A presynaptic cell excites inhibitory interneurons and they inhibit neighboring cells in the network.  As described in detail later in the Chapter, this type of circuit can be used in sensory systems to provide edge enhancement. Feedback/recurrent inhibition . In Panel E1, a presynaptic cell connects to a postsynaptic cell, and the postsynaptic cell in turn connects to an interneuron, which then inhibits the presynaptic cell.  This circuit can limit excitation in a pathway.  Some initial excitation would be shut off after the red interneuron becomes active.  In Panel E2, each neuron in the closed chain inhibits the neuron to which it is connected.  This circuit would appear to do nothing, but, as will be seen later in the Chapter, it can lead to the generation of complex patterns of spike activity. Feedback/recurrent excitation . In Panel F1, a presynaptic neuron excites a postsynaptic neuron and that postsynaptic neuron excites the presynaptic neuron.  This type of circuit can serve a switch-like function because once the presynaptic cell is activated that activation could be perpetuated.  Activation of the presynaptic neuron could switch this network on and it could stay on. Panel F2 shows variants of feedback excitation in which a presynaptic neuron excites a postsynaptic neuron that can feedback to excite itself (a, an autapse) or other neurons which ultimately feedback (b) to itself.</p>\n<p></p>",

They need to encounter certain \u2018neurological gates\u2019 at the spinal cord level and these gates determine whether the pain signals should reach the brain or not. In other words, pain is perceived when the gate gives way to the pain signals and it is less intense or not at all perceived when the gate closes for the signals to pass through. This theory gives the explanation for why someone finds relief by rubbing or massaging an injured or a painful area.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option A. Inhibitory neurotransmitter at spinal cord: This option does not fully describe the mechanism of TENS. While the spinal cord does play a role in the gating mechanism described above, TENS does not primarily involve the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters to manage pain. Option B. Adrenergic receptor stimulation: Adrenergic receptors are related to the sympathetic nervous system, which is involved in the \"fight or flight\" response. While adrenergic receptors may have some influence on pain perception, they are not the primary mechanism of action for TENS. Option D. Supra-spinal control: Supra-spinal control refers to pain modulation at higher brain centers (above the level of the spinal cord), such as the brainstem and cortex. While these brain regions can indeed influence pain perception, the primary mechanism of TENS is the gating theory, which operates at the spinal cord level.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS): The gate control theory forms the basis of TENS. In this technique, the selective stimulation of the large diameter nerve fibers carrying non-pain sensory stimuli from a specific region nullifies or reduces the effect of pain signals from the region. TENS is a non-invasive and inexpensive pain management approach that has been widely used for the treatment of chronic and intractable pain that are otherwise non-responsive to analgesics and surgical treatments. TENS is highly advantageous over pain medications in the aspect that it does not have the problem of drug interactions and toxicity.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Priming The correct option is Priming because the hint (rhymes with what you get at McDonald's) unconsciously influences the student's response, leading them to recall the answer without conscious awareness.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Semantic Priming To experience priming firsthand have a friend say \"silk\" 10 times as fast as s/he can. Then ask your friend \"What does a cow drink?\" If your friend answers \"milk\", you have just experienced priming. In this example your friend was \"primed\" to say the wrong answer \"milk\" in two ways. First, \"silk\" rhymes with the wrong answer, and second, \"cow\" is associated with the wrong answer. (Cows drink water, by the way, not milk!) In what has become the standard priming task, people see pairs of words presented on a computer and are asked to respond to the second word. Priming is the finding that people can respond faster and more accurately to a word if it is preceded by a related or identical word compared to when it preceded by an unrelated word. Currently we are using this priming paradigm to examine various aspects of word recognition, including bilingual memory representation. Additionally we are using a masked priming procedure to investigate subliminal word identification. The same thing happens in the question as well. The examiner asks, Who recorded the first EEG? (The answer to that is Hans Berger). Seeing that the student had no clue, examiner gave him a clue by telling him that \u201cthe name rhymes with what you get at MC Donald\u2019s\u201d. (People tend to think of burgers when they are told about McDonalds. That\u2019s what the student thought as well and must\u2019ve guessed the name as Burger, which almost rhymes with the actual name of the scientist Hans Berger. Here the examiner made the student think of a rhyming word and made him guess the right answer. This is an example of priming.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option B. Reflex: Reflex is an involuntary and nearly instantaneous response to a specific stimulus. It is an automatic reaction that occurs without conscious thought or awareness. In this scenario, the student's response was not a reflex but a conscious thought process after receiving a hint. Option C. Associated Learning: Associated learning, also known as associative learning, is a type of learning where two events or stimuli become linked or associated with each other. Classical conditioning, where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus to trigger a conditioned response, is an example of associated learning. The student's response in the scenario does not involve forming an association between two stimuli; instead, it's a case of priming, where a hint triggered a memory without conscious awareness. Option D. Declarative Memory: Declarative memory is a type of long-term memory that deals with conscious recall of facts and events. It includes both episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (general knowledge and facts). In the scenario, the student's response was not a result of declarative memory; they did not consciously recall the answer based on past learning. Instead, it was the result of priming, an implicit form of memory.</p>\n<p></p>",

For example, the negative charge of a no diffusible anion hinders diffusion of the diffusible cations and favors diffusion of the diffusible anions. Consider the situation shown in Image below, in which the membrane (M) between compartment X and compartment Y is impermeable to charged proteins (Prot \u2212 ) but freely permeable to K + and Cl \u2212 . Assume that the concentrations of the anions (eg, Cl \u2212 ) and of the cations (eg, K + ) on the two sides are initially equal. Cl \u2212 diffuses down its concentration gradient from Y to X, and some K + moves with the negatively charged Cl \u2212 because of its opposite charge. Therefore, [K + X ] > [K + Y ] Furthermore, [K + X ] + [Cl \u2212 X ] + [Prot \u2212 X ] > [K + Y ] + [Cl \u2212 Y ] that is, more osmotically active particles are on side X (or compartment X) than on side Y (or compartment Y).

Image showing two compartments (X and Y) separated by the membrane (M). Charged K + and Cl \u2212 are distributed in both compartments, while charged protein (prot \u2212 ) is only in X compartment.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>14L The amount of mannitol injected is 10gm. The amount of mannitol excreted is 10% which comes to be 1 gm. So the leftover mannitol in the body is 9gms. Plasma concentration at equilibrium is 65mg/100ml. That means 100ml of ECF, contains 65mg of mannitol. Therefore, 9gm of mannitol would have around (9gm x 100ml)/65mg. On calculating, it comes around 14Litres (13.8 litres).</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Mannitol cannot cross cell membranes, hence, it will be distributed in CF but not in IF. Thus mannitol is a marker for CF volume and therefore calculating the volume of distribution of mannitol gives the value of CF volume.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Blood volume control by kidney In negative feedback, feedback gain of infinity could be seen in blood volume control by the kidney. When the blood volume falls below the equilibrium, the renal-body fluid mechanism causes the blood volume to return back to the equilibrium point resulting in zero error and hence the gain of kidney in its ability to regulate blood volume is infinity (\u221e).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>\u201cChanges in the circulatory system that have very acute pronounced effects on the arterial pressure \u2014 changes in total peripheral resistance, pumping capability of the heart, or vascular capacitance \u2014all become completely compensated by the infinite feedback gain mechanism of the kidney-fluid system for controlling the pressur \u201d \u201cIf the arterial pressure falls below the equilibrium point, the intake of water and salt is greater than the output. Therefore, body fluid volume increases, blood volume increases, and the arterial pressure rises until once again it returns exactly to the equilibrium point. This return of the arterial pressure always back to the equilibrium point is the near infinite feedback gain principle for control of arterial pressure by the renal\u2013body fluid mechanism .\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Temperature control in hypothalamus: Temperature control in the hypothalamus is an example of negative feedback, where the body regulates its internal temperature to maintain homeostasis. When body temperature deviates from the set point, the hypothalamus activates appropriate mechanisms to restore it to the normal range. For example, if body temperature rises, the hypothalamus triggers responses like sweating and vasodilation to dissipate heat and bring the temperature back down. The feedback gain in this system is not infinite; it is finite and designed to maintain temperature within a specific range. Option: C. Blood pressure control by baroreflex: The baroreflex is a negative feedback mechanism that regulates blood pressure. Baroreceptors, located in the walls of certain blood vessels (e.g., carotid sinus, aortic arch), sense changes in blood pressure. When blood pressure increases or decreases, the baroreceptors send signals to the brain, specifically the cardiovascular control center in the medulla oblongata, which then adjusts heart rate and blood vessel dilation/constriction to restore blood pressure to the normal range. Again, the feedback gain in this system is not infinite; it is finite and operates within a specific range of blood pressure. Option: D. No such infinite feedback gain is not possible: While it is true that most biological systems exhibit finite feedback gain and are designed to maintain stability within certain limits, there are exceptional cases where pathological conditions or malfunctions can lead to infinite feedback gain. One such example is the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) in the context of blood volume control by the kidney, as explained in the previous response. In most physiological scenarios, infinite feedback gain is not observed, but it is essential to recognize these exceptions and their implications in certain disease states.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Mechanically The correct coupling between DHPR and RYR in skeletal muscle is mechanical, involving a physical interaction between the two receptors, and not chemical or electric in nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The process by which membrane depolarization of the muscle fiber initiates contraction is called excitation\u2013contraction coupling. The action potential is transmitted to all the fibrils in the fiber via the T system. It triggers the release of Ca 2+ from the terminal cisterns, the lateral sacs of the sarcoplasmic reticulum next to the T system . Depolarization of the T tubule membrane activates the sarcoplasmic reticulum via dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs ), named for the drug dihydropyridine, which blocks them. DHPRs are voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels in the T tubule membrane. In cardiac muscle, influx of Ca 2+ via these channels triggers the release of Ca 2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (ie, Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ release) by activating the ryanodine receptor (RyR). The RyR is named after the plant alkaloid ryanodine that was used in its discovery. The RyR is a ligand-gated Ca 2+ channel with Ca 2+ as its natural ligand. In skeletal muscle, Ca 2+ entry from the extracellular fluid (ECF) by this route is not required for Ca 2+ release . Instead, the DHPR that serves as the voltage sensor triggers release of Ca 2+ from the nearby sarcoplasmic reticulum via physical interaction with the RyR. The released Ca 2+ is quickly amplified through Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ release. Cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration is reduced in the muscle cell by the sarcoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA). The SERCA pump uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to remove Ca 2+ from the cytosol back into the terminal cisterns against its concentration gradient, where it is stored until released by the next action potential. Once cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration, or the Ca 2+ concentration outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum, has been lowered sufficiently, chemical interaction between myosin and actin ceases and the muscle relaxes. Note that ATP provides the energy for both contraction (at the myosin head) and relaxation (via SERCA). Therefore, in short, electrical activation of T tubules causes the activation of DHPR channels. These channels mechanically activate RYR receptors for the release of calcium. [Therefore electrical followed by mechanical is the best answer, if not in the options one can go with mechanical as the as the answer]</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Chemically: In skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling, the coupling between DHPR and RYR receptors is not mediated by chemical signaling. It is not accomplished through the binding of chemical ligands or neurotransmitters. Instead, it is achieved through a mechanical interaction between the DHPRs and RYRs. Option: C. Electrical followed by mechanical: While the excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle does involve an initial electrical event (the action potential traveling along the T-tubules), it is not directly followed by a separate mechanical event. The electrical event (depolarization of the T-tubules) leads to the mechanical coupling between DHPRs and RYRs, causing calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This single step of mechanical coupling then leads to muscle contraction, without a distinct intermediate mechanical event. Option: D. Electric: The term \"Electric\" is not an accurate description of the coupling between DHPR and RYR in skeletal muscle. It is not an electric coupling or electrical interaction. Instead, it is a mechanical coupling as mentioned earlier, where the opening of DHPRs mechanically triggers the opening of RYRs.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In skeletal muscle, dihydropyridine and ryanodine receptors show mechanical coupling involving structural interaction between the two. Dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) are voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the T tubule membrane. The ryanodine receptor (Ry) is a ligand-gated Ca2+ channel with Ca2+ as its natural ligand. Skeletal muscle excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling is thought to occur by a \"mechanical coupling* mechanism involving protein-protein interactions that lead to activation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor by the voltage-sensing transverse (T-) tubule dihydropyridine receptor.</p>\n<p></p>",
