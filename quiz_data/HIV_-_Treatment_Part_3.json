Gumma manifests radiologically as ill-defined radiolucencies that may resemble malignancy.

They are surrounded by an erythematous halo and some oedema. Found on non-keratinized mobile mucosa of the lips, cheeks, floor of the mouth, sulci, or ventrum of the tongue Uncommon on the keratinized mucosa of the palate or dorsum of the tongue. Dentigerous ulcer The most common location of dentigerous cysts are the Mandibular 3rd Molars and the Maxillary Canines, and they rarely involve deciduous teeth.
