      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Commonly associated with depression OCD, or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, is a psychiatric condition characterized by recurrent obsessions and compulsions. OCD commonly co-occurs with depression. It is estimated that approximately 60% of individuals with OCD experience depressive symptoms at some point in their lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>OCD is a chronic condition that can significantly impair daily functioning. Common obsessions include contamination, pathological doubt, aggressive or sexual thoughts, and symmetry. Common compulsions include washing, checking, counting, and arranging. Treatment for OCD involves a combination of medication (typically SSRIs) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly exposure and response prevention (ERP).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. While atypical antipsychotics may be used as augmentation strategies in some cases of treatment-resistant OCD, the first-line treatment for OCD is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline. Option C. The correct prevalence of OCD is around 2-3% in the general population, not 7-10%. Option D. Contamination obsessions, characterized by fears of germs, dirt, or contaminants, are actually one of the most common types of obsessions in OCD.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown promise as a treatment option for severe and treatment-resistant OCD. Family accommodation, where family members enable or participate in the patient's OCD rituals, can contribute to the maintenance of OCD symptoms.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Anterograde amnesia with loss of recent memory Korsakoff syndrome is characterized by anterograde amnesia with a loss of recent memory. The patient retains memories from the past but struggles to form new memories. In Korsakoff syndrome, the patient remains active, alert, and responsive despite the memory impairment.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Korsakoff syndrome is commonly associated with chronic alcoholism and thiamine (B1) deficiency. Thiamine deficiency can lead to impaired functioning of metabolic enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase, transketolase, and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thiamine deficiency can be diagnosed by assessing erythrocyte thiamine transketolase activity. Treatment of Korsakoff syndrome involves thiamine supplementation, and it is important to administer thiamine before glucose to avoid precipitating Wernicke's encephalopathy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. The triad of acute confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia is seen in Wernicke's encephalopathy, not Korsakoff syndrome. Option C. Loss of identity memory is not a characteristic feature of Korsakoff syndrome. Option D. Impairment of implicit memory and immediate recall may be present, but the defining feature is anterograde amnesia with loss of recent memory.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Korsakoff syndrome is considered a long-term consequence of thiamine deficiency and is characterized by both anterograde and retrograde amnesia. Patients with Korsakoff syndrome often display confabulation, which refers to the fabrication of false or distorted memories to fill in gaps caused by the amnesia. Structural neuroimaging may reveal bilateral necrosis of the mammillary bodies, and involvement of the dorsal medial nucleus of the thalamus is also observed in Wernicke's encephalopathy.</p>\n<p></p>",
