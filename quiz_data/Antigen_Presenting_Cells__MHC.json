      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Cells that are not able to express MHC 1 NK cell inhibitory receptors recognize self-class I MHC molecules , which are expressed in all healthy cells . The inhibitory receptors prevent NK cells from killing normal cells . Virus infection or neoplastic transformation often enhances the expression of ligands for activating receptors and at the same time reduces the expression of class I MHC molecules . As a result, the balance is tilted toward activation, and the infected or tumor cell is killed .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Natural Killer cells The function of NK cells is to recognize and destroy severely stressed or abnormal cells , such as virus-infected cells and tumor cells . NK cells make up approximately 5% to 10% of peripheral blood lymphocytes . NK cells express CD16, a receptor for IgG Fc tails that confers on NK cells the ability to lyse IgG-coated target cells .
