The aminotransferases are generally present in the serum in low concentrations. These enzymes are released more significantly into the blood when damage to the liver cell membrane increases permeability. Liver cell necrosis is not required to release the aminotransferases, and there is a poor correlation between the degree of liver cell damage and the level of the aminotransferases. Thus, the absolute elevation of the aminotransferases is of no prognostic significance in acute hepatocellular disorders.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A: AST is found in the liver, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, pancreas, lungs, leukocytes, and erythrocytes in decreasing order of concentration.

Liver Function Tests (LFTs) AST (aspartate aminotransferase)     (11-47 IU/L) AST is an enzyme found throughout the body, but predominantly in heart and liver cells. Most useful in detecting liver damage due to hepatitis, drugs toxic to the liver, cirrhosis, and alcoholism. Often ordered in conjunction with ALT. ALT (alanine aminotransferase) (7-56 IU/L) An enzyme found mostly in the cells of the liver and kidney. When the liver is damaged, ALT is released into the blood stream. ALT is a useful test for detecting liver damage. Most useful in detecting damage due to hepatitis and drugs or other substances toxic to the liver. Often ordered in conjunction with AST. AST/ALT Ratio The AST/ALT ratio is usually increased in alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and in the first day or two of acute hepatitis or injury from bile duct obstruction. ALP (alkaline phosphatase) (30-120 IU/L) Found in bone and in the cells of bile ducts. ALP can indicate blockage of one or more bile ducts, liver cancer, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or when hepatotoxic drugs are taken.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>MacroAST-AST is associated with immunoglobulins .
