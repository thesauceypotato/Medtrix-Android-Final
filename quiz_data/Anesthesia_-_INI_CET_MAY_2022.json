      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>N2O < Isoflurane < Halothane < Methoxyflurane The MAC of an inhaled anesthetic is the alveolar concentration that prevents movement in 50% of patients in response to a standardized stimulus (eg, surgical incision). Useful measure because it mirrors brain partial pressure, allows comparisons of potency between agents, and provides a standard for experimental evaluations Lower the MAC higher is the potency. This is because potency is inversely proportional to MAC (Minimum Alveolar Concentration). Methoxyflurane > Halothane > Isoflurane > Enflurane > Ether > Sevoflurane > Desflurane > Xenon > Nitrous oxide N 2 O - Nitrous oxide can be used for general anesthesia, procedural sedation, dental anesthesia, and to treat severe pain . Nitrous oxide's potent analgesic properties can be useful in providing analgesia in settings such as the obstetrical ward or emergency department. Isoflurane is an inhaled general anesthetic used in surgery. A stable, non-explosive inhalation anesthetic, relatively free from significant side effects. Halothane is a general inhalation anesthetic used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. It reduces the blood pressure and frequently decreases the pulse rate and depresses respiration . It induces muscle relaxation and reduces pain sensitivity by altering tissue excitability. Methoxyflurane is a volatile anesthetic originally used in the 1960s until it was found to be nephrotoxic at anesthetic doses3 (typically 40\u201360 mL). Since the 1970s it has been used in Australia in lower doses for acute analgesia (up to 6 mL), largely by paramedic services.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Gate Control Theory Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is widely used to relieve a wide range of painful conditions, including non-malignant acute and chronic pain and pain resulting from cancer and its treatment. During TENS pulsed electrical currents are generated by a small battery operated TENS device that can be kept in the pocket or attached to the user's belt. Currents from the TENS device are delivered through the skin by two self-adhering electrode pads The purpose of TENS is to selectively activate nerve fibers. Maximal pain relief is achieved when TENS generates a strong non-painful electrical sensation beneath the electrodes. Pain relief is usually rapid in onset and stops shortly after TENS is turned off. For this reason patients are encouraged to deliver TENS for as long as needed, which may be for hours at a time and throughout the day. It is based on the gate control theory of pain According to this Gate-Control Theory of Pain, activity in large diameter low threshold mechanoreceptive (touch-related) nerve fibers could inhibit the transmission of action potentials from small diameter higher threshold nociceptive (pain-related) fibers through pre and post synaptic inhibition in the dorsal horn of spinal cord. Because nociceptive fibers (A-delta and C-fibers) have a higher threshold of activation than mechanoreceptive fibers (A-beta fibers) it was proposed that it would be possible to selectively stimulate mechanoreceptive fibers by titrating the amplitude of electrical currents delivered across the surface of the skin (ie TENS). This would prevent signals from nociceptive fibers from reaching higher centres of the brain, thus reducing pain</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - This descending inhibition can be selective, with different regions of the brain inhibiting certain inputs to the spinal cord . Some regions reduce mechanoreceptive input, and others reduce noxious and warmth inputs. Descending inhibition can also reduce input from the skin while increasing input related to movement. Option C - At the level of the spinal cord, opioids can inhibit transmitter release from primary afferent terminals as well as activity of pain transmission neurons . Norepinephrine (NE) release from spinopetal noradrenergic fibers from medullary sites also inhibits pain transmission. Option D - central sensitization represents an abnormal state of responsiveness or increased gain of the nociceptive system . The pain is effectively generated as a consequence of changes within the CNS that then alter how it responds to sensory inputs, rather than reflecting the presence of peripheral noxious stimuli.</p>\n<p></p>",
