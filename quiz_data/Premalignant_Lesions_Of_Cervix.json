It is acceptable to have a pap test alone every 3 years. Women should stop having cervical cancer screening after the age of 65 years if they do not have a H/O moderate or severe dysplasia or cancer and they have had either three negative pap test results in a row or two negative co-test results in a row within 10 years, with the most recent test performed within the past 5 years. Women, who have a history of cervical cancer, are infected with HIV, or have been exposed to DES should have annual screening done. In HIV-positive females, if three consecutive tests are normal, they can have testing once in every 3 years instead of annually. Abnormal results are reported according to the Bethesda System . They include: In the Bethesda system: The most common cytological abnormality encountered is atypical squamous cells (ASC) . The category ASC is further divided into ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of unknown significance), and ASC-H (atypical squamous cells where HSIL cannot be ruled out) Squamous cell abnormalities (SIL) Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL or LSIL) Atypical squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL or HSIL) Squamous cell carcinoma Glandular epithelial cell abnormalities\u2013 Endocervical and endometrial abnormalities can also be detected by pap smear A number of infectious processes, including yeast, candidiasis, herpes simplex virus, and trichomoniasis can also be detected however, it is not very sensitive at detecting these infections</p>\n<p></p>",
