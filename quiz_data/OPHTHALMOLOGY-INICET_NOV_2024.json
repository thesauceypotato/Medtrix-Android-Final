Pterygion = a wing) is a wing-shaped fold of conjunctiva encroaching upon the cornea from either side within the interpalpebral fissure. pterygium is a degenerative and hyperplastic condition of conjunctiva. The subconjunctival tissue undergoes elastotic degeneration and proliferates as vascularised granulation tissue under the epithelium, which ultimately encroaches the cornea. The corneal epithelium, Bowman's layer and superficial stroma are destroyed. Clinical Features: Age: Usually seen in old age. Sex: More common in males doing outdoor work than females. Laterality: It may be unilateral or bilateral. Usually present on the nasal side but may also occur on the temporal side. Symptoms: Cosmetic intolerance may be the only issue in otherwise asymptomatic condition in early stages. Foreign body sensation and irritation may be experienced. Defective vision occurs when it encroaches the pupillary area or due to corneal astigmatism induced by fibrosis in the regressive stage.

A scrambled egg appearance of macula. Stage of scarring. Hypertrophic or atrophic vascularized scar at macula.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. ERG:- ERG is very useful in detecting functional abnormalities of the outer retina (up to bipolar cell layer), much before the ophthalmoscopic signs appear. However, ERG is normal in diseases involving ganglion cells and the higher visual pathway, such as optic atrophy. Option: C. Multifocal Erg:- in case of best disease ERG. is supplementary to EOG . Option: D. Visual Evoked Potential:- In the lesions affecting the conduction of the nerve impulse by visual pathway (e.g. retrobulbar neuritis) the amplitude is reduced and there is delay in the transmission time. The timing of the response is more reliable than the amplitude. Increased latency is also common in macular dysfunction; therefore, a delayed VEP should not be considered pathognomonic of optic nerve disease.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Prevents Anterior Chamber from collapsing during crucial steps like Capsulorrhexis and IOL placement. Viscosity of the substances should be enough to provide sufficient space for manipulation within the eye. Protectability and maintenance of space. It should protect the endothelium, separate the tissues, maintain the space and act as a lubricant</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Use of viscous or viscoelastic substances has become almost mandatory in the modern microphthalmic surgery, especially intraocular lens implantation, which involves a risk of involuntary tissue damage due to intraocular manipulations. Properties of viscoelastic substances An ideal viscoelastic substance should have the following properties: Chemically, the material should be inert Optically clear. Viscosity of the substances should be enough to provide sufficient space for manipulation within the eye. Hydrophilic and dilutable properties are necessary to irrigate the material out of the eye after the operation. Protectability and maintenance of space. It should protect the endothelium, separate the tissues, maintain the space and act as a lubricant.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. It does not cause injury to corneal endothelium it is used to protect corneal endothelium. Option: C. Postoperative rise in intraocular pressure may occur if a considerable amount of viscoelastic substance is left inside the anterior chamber; so it must be washed off after surgery. Option: D. methylcellulose is the most commonly used substance .</p>\n<p></p>",
