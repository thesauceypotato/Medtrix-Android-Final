It passes through the diaphragm via the caval foramen, which is situated within the central tendon of the diaphragm at the level of the eighth thoracic vertebra (T8). The central tendon ensures that the IVC remains patent during respiration, allowing for consistent blood flow to the heart. The diaphragm has three primary openings: the aortic hiatus at T12, the esophageal hiatus at T10, and the caval foramen at T8. The IVC specifically traverses through the caval foramen, unlike other structures that pass through different diaphragmatic apertures.

It refers to an inability to oppose or flex the thumb due to weakness or paralysis of the thenar muscles (especially the opponens pollicis), which are innervated by the median nerve.

Claw hand : Claw hand, or \"clawing\" of the fingers, usually results from a combined ulnar and median nerve lesion. It is characterized by hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and flexion at the interphalangeal (IP) joints. It can also result from a high ulnar nerve lesion on its own. The claw hand deformity is not a typical consequence of radial nerve injury.</li><li>\u2022 Option B</li><li>\u2022 Claw hand</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Claudication : Claudication refers to pain, cramping, or fatigue in muscles, typically the calves, during walking or exercise. It's a symptom of peripheral arterial disease, where there's reduced blood flow to the legs.

The middle radioulnar joint is classified as a fibrous joint known as a syndesmosis, where the bones are connected by dense fibrous tissues\u2014the interosseous membrane and the oblique cord. The interosseous membrane is a broad, thin collagenous sheet running distomedially between the interosseous borders of the radius and ulna, providing significant stability and allowing for controlled movement of the forearm during pronation and supination. The oblique cord, extending from the radial tuberosity to the lateral side of the ulnar tuberosity, also contributes to this stabilizing structure. Unlike the proximal and distal radioulnar joints, which are uniaxial synovial pivot joints allowing rotational movements, the middle radioulnar joint does not have a joint cavity and primarily functions to hold the bones together.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options</li><li>\u2022 Other Options</li><li>\u2022 A. Synovial pivot joint: The proximal and distal radioulnar joints are classified as synovial pivot joints, which allow rotational movement around a single axis.

Synovial pivot joint:</li><li>\u2022 B. Cartilaginous joint: Cartilaginous joints involve bones connected by cartilage, such as synchondroses and symphyses, which allow limited movement.

The approximate length to be inserted is around 55 cm.

The ideal placement for an NG tube used for suction is within the stomach to avoid damage to the duodenum. In contrast, an NG feeding tube should be placed post-pyloric to reduce the risk of aspiration.</li><li>\u27a4 Indications for NG tube usage include gastric decompression in intestinal obstruction, aspiration of gastric fluid, nutritional support, and medication administration.
