If they are both currently pregnant again, these women would have an obstetric history of G3 P2 and G3 P0 respectively. Sometimes a suffix is added to indicate the number of miscarriages or terminations a woman has had. So if the second woman had had two miscarriages, it could be annotated G3 P0+2. A nulliparous woman (nullip) has not given birth previously (regardless of outcome). A primigravida is in her first pregnancy. A primiparous woman has given birth once.

The term, therefore, includes all pregnancy losses from the time of conception until 28 weeks of gestation. Recurrent miscarriage, defined as the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies , affects 1% of couples trying to conceive. Antiphospholipid syndrome is the most important treatable cause of recurrent miscarriage. The mechanisms by which antiphospholipid antibodies cause pregnancy morbidity include inhibition of trophoblastic function and differentiation, activation of complement pathways at the maternal-fetal interface resulting in a local inflammatory response and, in later pregnancy, thrombosis of the uteroplacental vasculature. Pregnancy morbidity includes unexplained recurrent early miscarriage, fetal death and late obstetrical manifestation such as pre-eclampsia, premature birth or fetal growth restriction associated with placental insufficiency. Current treatment to prevent obstetrical morbidity is based on low-dose aspirin and/or low-molecular-weight heparin and has improved pregnancy outcomes to achieve successful live birth in >70% of pregnancies. While syphilis is also a major cause of miscarriage, by Kassowitz law; since the patient has had recurrent miscarriages the probability becomes less and hence APLAS is the better-suited answer for this case.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>GUIDELINES: All women with recurrent first-trimester miscarriages and all women with one or more second-trimester miscarriages should be screened before pregnancy for antiphospholipid antibodies. Cytogenetic analysis should be performed on products of the conception of the third and subsequent consecutive miscarriage(s). Parental peripheral blood karyotyping of both partners should be performed in couples with recurrent miscarriages where testing of products of conception reports an unbalanced structural chromosomal abnormality. All women with recurrent first-trimester miscarriages and all women with one or more second-trimester miscarriages should have a pelvic ultrasound to assess uterine anatomy. Suspected uterine anomalies may require further investigations to confirm the diagnosis, using hysteroscopy, laparoscopy or three-dimensional pelvic ultrasound. Two-dimensional ultrasound scanning and/or hysterosalpingograph is better suited as an initial screening test. Combined hysteroscopy and laparoscopy and possibly 3D ultrasound scanning should be used for definitive diagnosis. Women with a second-trimester miscarriage should be screened for inherited thrombophilias including factor V Leiden, factor II (prothrombin) gene mutation and protein S.</p>\n<p></p>",

In the third trimester, treatment will usually continue with daily suppressive acyclovir 400 mg three times daily until delivery. Caesarean section should be the recommended mode of delivery for all women developing first episode genital herpes in the third trimester, particularly those developing symptoms within 6 weeks of expected delivery, as the risk of neonatal transmission of HSV is very high at 41%. It can be difficult to distinguish clinically between primary and recurrent genital HSV infections, as in up to 15% of cases where a woman presents with a first episode of clinical HSV infection, it will actually be a recurrent infection. For women presenting with the first episode of genital herpes in the third trimester, particularly within 6 weeks of expected delivery, type-specific HSV antibody testing (immunoglobulin G [IgG] antibodies to HSV-1 and HSV-2) is advisable. For these women, characterizing the infection will influence the advice given regarding the mode of delivery and the risk of neonatal herpes infection. The presence of antibodies of the same type as the HSV isolated from genital swabs would confirm this episode to be a recurrence rather than a primary infection and elective caesarean section would not be indicated to prevent neonatal transmission. However, it should be noted that it may take 2\u20133 weeks for the results of this test to become available. It is therefore recommended that an initial plan of delivery should be based on the assumption that all first-episode lesions are primary genital herpes. This plan can then be modified if HSV antibody test results subsequently confirm a recurrent, rather than primary, infection.</p>\n<p></p>",

The option chosen depends on the urgency to control bleeding, the source of bleeding (intrauterine versus extrauterine), and the surgeon's expertise and preference: Manual aortic compression (in highly urgent settings) Uterine tourniquet Intrauterine balloon tamponade Ligation of the uterine and utero-ovarian arteries Pelvic pack Clamp across utero-ovarian ligaments (note: will occlude fallopian tubes) Internal iliac artery ligation (procedure of last resort) Intraoperative blood salvage may be arranged before laparotomy or requested during laparotomy, but its use is investigational in the obstetric setting. Bleeding from a hysterotomy incision can generally be controlled by suture ligation. The angles of a transverse incision should be clearly visualized to ensure that they, and any retracted vessels, are completely ligated Bilateral ligation of the uterine vessels (O'Leary stitch ) is the preferred approach for controlling PPH from laceration of the uterine artery or branches of the utero-ovarian artery. If uterine atony persists despite uterine massage and administration of uterotonic drugs and tranexamic acid, we suggest rapidly moving on to the placement of uterine compression sutures, which are an effective method for reducing uterine blood loss related to atony. Manual compression of the uterus, insertion of an intrauterine balloon for tamponade, placement of a uterine tourniquet, and/or ligation of the uterine and utero-ovarian arteries can reduce ongoing heavy blood loss before attempting the procedure and may obviate the need for the compression sutures.</p>\n<p></p>",

One-third to one-half of individuals with Turner syndrome are born with a heart defect, such as a narrowing of the large artery leaving the heart ( coarctation of the aorta ) or abnormalities of the valve that connects the aorta with the heart (the aortic valve).
