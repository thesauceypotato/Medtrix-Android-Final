However, clinical efficacy in asthma is similar to that of montelukast . The duration of action of zileuton is short and it has hepatotoxic potential.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pulmonary hypertension in Neonates Explanation: Inhaled NO: Apart from being an important signal molecule, exogenously administered No gas has limited therapeutic application as well. Inhaled NO is indicated in severe respiratory distress in neonates with elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. It dilates pulmonary vessels, particularly in areas of the lung that are better ventilated, reducing the ventilation-perfusion mismatch and improving gaseous exchange. The elevated pulmonary artery pressure is lowered and cardiopulmonary function is improved. Inhaled No improves cardiopulmonary function in adult patients as well with severe PAH, but this can only be a short-term measure.
