      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>It is as diffusible through the membrane as water A molecule with an osmolality of zero means that it does not exert any osmotic pressure and does not cause water to flow across the membrane. Therefore, the correct answer is: \"It is as diffusible through the membrane as water.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The osmolality of a substance i s the number of osmoles per kg of solvent. One osmole (Osm) equals the gram molecular weight of a substance divided by the number of free-moving particles that each molecule liberates in solution. Osmotically active substances in the body are dissolved in water, and the density of water is 1. Thus, osmolar concentrations can be expressed as osmoles (or milliosmoles) per liter of water. If the osmolality is zero, there are no free-moving particles, and thus, the molecule is as diffusible as water through the membrane.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Molecules with a low molecular weight, small size, and high diffusibility are preferred in dialysis solutions because they can pass through the semipermeable membrane easily and efficiently. In contrast, molecules that are too large or have low diffusibility may not be effectively removed by peritoneal dialysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>A. The rate of is diffusion directly proportional to:- Concentration gradient. Solubility in the membrane. Temperature. The surface area of the membrane B. The rate of diffusion is inversely proportional with: The molecular weight of the diffusible substance. The thickness of the membrane</p>\n<p></p>",
