      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Consider mass lesion, stroke Here the patient is having no history of epilepsy The metabolic screen is also negative Next step would be performing MRI and EEG Here the patient is having focal features of seizures Hence we have to consider mass lesions, stroke, CNS infections, trauma, and degenerative disease. Hence this is the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Evaluation of Adult patient with seizure:</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. perform lumbar puncture Further workups like lumbar puncture, cultures are done only when there is a positive metabolic screen or there are signs suggesting a metabolic or infectious disorder. Option: B. Idiopathic seizure is the diagnosis This diagnosis is given when there is the absence of: Focal features of seizures Focal abnormalities on clinic or lab investigation Other evidence of neurologic dysfunction Option D. Considers antiepileptic therapy -Here the patient is found to have focal features of seizures\u2192 Next step would be the treatment of the underlying disorder and then only we have to consider antiepileptic therapy.</p>\n<p></p>",
