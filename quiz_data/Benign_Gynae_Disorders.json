Most often, the ovary and fallopian tube rotate as a single entity. Infrequently, an ovary may alone turn about its mesovarium, and rarely a fallopian tube twists alone about the mesosalpinx. Most commonly occurs during the reproductive years Common in pregnancy. Risk Factors Adnexal masses with increased mobility Excessively mobile mesovaria or fallopian tubes and may increase the risk in even normal adnexa. Pathologically enlarged ovaries with a diameter > 6 cm (Rt ovary more common) Dermoid cysts are light and tend to undergo torsion easily C/F Classically, the woman with adnexal torsion complains of sharp lower abdominal pain with sudden onset that worsens intermittently over several hours. The pain usually is localized to the involved side, with radiation to the aflnk, groin, or thigh. Low-grade fever suggests adnexal necrosis. Nausea and vomiting frequently accompany the pain. Adnexal mass may not be palpable. Diagnosis Ultrasound D/D: Ectopic pregnancy, tuboovarian abscess, hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, and endometrioma. The twisted pedicle may also appear as a bull\u2019s-eye target, whirlpool, or snail shell, that is, a rounded hyperechoic structure with multiple, inner, concentric hypoechoic rings. Transvaginal color Doppler sonography may show disruption of normal adnexal blood ow. disruption Management Laparoscopy and detorsion: Management of choice If ovarian cyst: Cystectomy can be done at same or separate sitting If no return to vascularity: Can consider adnexectomy/ ovariectomy To minimize recurrence:  unilateral or bilateral oophoropexy</li><li>\u27a4 Torsion involves the twisting of adnexal components.</li><li>\u27a4 Most often, the ovary and fallopian tube rotate as a single entity.</li><li>\u27a4 Infrequently, an ovary may alone turn about its mesovarium, and rarely a fallopian tube twists alone about the mesosalpinx.</li><li>\u27a4 Most commonly occurs during the reproductive years</li><li>\u27a4 Common in pregnancy.</li><li>\u27a4 Risk Factors Adnexal masses with increased mobility Excessively mobile mesovaria or fallopian tubes and may increase the risk in even normal adnexa.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. A. Lichen Planus</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Lichen planus is an uncommon disease involves both cutaneous and mucosal surfaces and affects genders equally between ages 30 and 60 years Women typically complain of chronic vaginal discharge with intense vulvovaginal pruritus, burning pain, dyspareunia, and postcoital bleeding. On inspection, papules classically are brightly erythematous or violaceous, flat topped, shiny polygons most commonly round on the trunk, buccal mucosa, or flexor sur aces of the extremities Lacy, white striations (Wickham striae) are frequently found in conjunction with the papules and may also be present on the buccal mucosa Deep, painful erosions in the posterior vestibule can extend to the labia, resulting in agglutination. With speculum insertion, vulvar skin and vaginal mucosa bleed easily. Vaginal erosions can produce adhesions and synechiae, which may lead to vaginal obliteration. Women with suspected lichen planus require a thorough dermatologic survey looking or extragenital lesions. Nearly one quarter of women with oral lesions will have vulvovaginal involvement, and most with erosive vulvovaginal lichen planus will have oral involvement. Diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy.
