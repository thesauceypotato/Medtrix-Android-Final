Argyll Robertson Pupil: This is a condition where pupils are small and irregular but do not constrict when exposed to bright light (light-near dissociation). They do, however, constrict with accommodation . It is classically associated with neurosyphilis, particularly tabes dorsalis, and does not have a direct correlation with homonymous hemianopia.</li><li>\u2022 Option A</li><li>\u2022 Argyll Robertson Pupil:</li><li>\u2022 condition where pupils are small and irregular but do not constrict</li><li>\u2022 exposed to bright light</li><li>\u2022 constrict with accommodation</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Adie\u2019s Pupil: Also known as tonic pupil , it is usually unilateral and is larger than the other pupil . It reacts poorly to light but may have a better near response. This condition is caused by damage to the postganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic innervation of the eye and is not related to visual field defects.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.</li><li>\u2022 Adie\u2019s Pupil:</li><li>\u2022 tonic pupil</li><li>\u2022 unilateral and is larger than the other pupil</li><li>\u2022 condition is caused by damage to the postganglionic fibers</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Marcus Gunn Pupil: Also known as a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), it is a sign of asymmetrical optic nerve dysfunction . It is detected using the swinging flashlight test . However, in homonymous hemianopia, the optic nerve function is typically preserved until the optic chiasm, so a Marcus Gunn pupil is not expected.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.</li><li>\u2022 Marcus Gunn Pupil:</li><li>\u2022 relative afferent pupillary defect</li><li>\u2022 sign of asymmetrical optic nerve dysfunction</li><li>\u2022 detected using the swinging flashlight test</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 In a case of right homonymous hemianopia , the lesion lies at the level of left optic tract , and the pupillary abnormality seen in these cases will be Wernicke\u2019s pupil .</li><li>\u27a4 right homonymous hemianopia</li><li>\u27a4 lesion lies at the level of left optic tract</li><li>\u27a4 pupillary abnormality</li><li>\u27a4 Wernicke\u2019s pupil</li><li>\u27a4 REF : KHURANA COMPREHENSIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY 5 TH EDITION pg.no: 312</li><li>\u27a4 REF : KHURANA COMPREHENSIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY 5 TH EDITION pg.no: 312</li><li>\u27a4 2.
