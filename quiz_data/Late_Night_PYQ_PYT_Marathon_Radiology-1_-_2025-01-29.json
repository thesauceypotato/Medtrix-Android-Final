This is because they have a distinctive two-layer structure which shows up clearly on radiographs. The appearance in the X-ray  is characteristic of a button battery, with a clearly visible double rim.

The seashore sign is characterized by a sandy or granular pattern in the lower half of the M-mode display, beneath the pleural line. This pattern is caused by the motion of the lung relative to the pleura during breathing. It is a normal finding, indicating that the lung is sliding smoothly against the parietal pleura, which helps rule out conditions like pneumothorax in the area scanned.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.
