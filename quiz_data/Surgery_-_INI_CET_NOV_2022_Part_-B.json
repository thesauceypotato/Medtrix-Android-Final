Colon cancer represents about two-thirds of cases, while rectal cancer accounts for the remaining one-third. Men are more affected than women, with 56% of cases occurring in men. The adenoma-carcinoma sequence is the prevailing theory on how most colorectal cancers develop. The APC gen e is mutated early in carcinogenesis and is present in two-thirds of colonic adenomas. K-ras mutations are more commonly found in larger lesions, indicating a later occurrence in the mutagenesis process.

Septa and daughter cysts may be visualized. The water-lily sign indicates a cyst with a floating, undulating membrane caused by a detached endocyst. May also show hyperdense internal septa within a cyst showing a spoke wheel pattern. Hydatid cyst classification Based on morphology the cyst can be classified into four different types Type I: simple cyst with no internal architecture type II: cyst with daughter cyst(s) and matrix type IIa: round daughter cysts at the periphery type IIb: larger, irregularly shaped daughter cysts occupying almost the entire volume of the mother cyst type IIc: oval masses with scattered calcifications and occasional daughter cysts type III: calcified cyst (dead cyst) type IV: complicated cyst, e.g. ruptured cyst</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hydatid disease is caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in its larval or cyst stage, which lives in canids and infects intermediate hosts such as sheep, cattle, pigs, and humans. The tapeworm sheds approximately 500 ova into the bowel of the canid host, and the infected ova-containing feces of dogs contaminate grass and farmland, which are then ingested by intermediate hosts. The liberated ovum burrows through the intestinal mucosa and is carried by the portal vein to the liver, where it develops into an adult cyst, with 70% of hydatid cysts forming in the liver. Hydatid disease is most common in sheep-raising areas , where dogs have access to infected offal, including South Australia, New Zealand, Africa, Greece, Spain, and the Middle East. Diagnosis of hydatid disease is based on the findings of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for echinococcal antigens, and results are positive in approximately 85% of infected patients. Ultrasonography and CT scanning of the abdomen are both quite sensitive for detecting hydatid cysts.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: Focal nodular hyperplasia is a benign liver lesion that is composed of a proliferation of hyperplastic hepatocytes surrounding a central stellate scar. Option C: Liver abscesses appear as peripherally enhancing, centrally hypoattenuating lesions. Option D: Hepatocellular carcinoma shows a focal nodule with early enhancement on the arterial phase with rapid washout of contrast on the portal venous phase of a three-phase contrast scan. MRI of HCC generally demonstrates high signal intensity on T2 imaging.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The treatment of hydatid disease treatment is surgically based unless the cysts are small or the patient is not a suitable candidate for surgical resection. Medical treatment with albendazole relies on drug diffusion through the cyst membrane, and surgical resection involving laparoscopic or open complete cyst removal with the instillation of a scolicidal agent is preferred and usually curative. Echinococcus multilocularis occurs in the Northern Hemispher e and can infect the liver similarly to E chinococcus granulosus, although the cysts are multilocular. Infection of the lung with Echinococcus multilocularis also is common (alveolar echinococcosis). Treatment of Echinococcus multilocularis consists of albendazole, but infection in the lung produces a more generalized granulomatous reaction and often requires resection.</p>\n<p></p>",

This results in an expanding haematoma with rapid deterioration and development of signs of raised ICP reminiscent of extradural haematoma, without the lucid interval. These collections require prompt evacuation, typically by craniotomy or craniectomy. Type II : Older and often anticoagulated, a lower energy injury leads to venous bleeding around the brain. Depending on the total volume of bleeding, the resulting haematoma may present early as acute subdural haematoma, after delay and osmotic expansion as chronic subdural haematoma or may even remain clinically silent. Type III : Present much later with a further \u2018acute-onchronic\u2019 subdural haematoma. On diagnosis, the clotting function should be corrected wherever possible. Bleeds of significant size, with significantly associated midline shift or with deteriorating neurology, require urgent evacuation. Smaller bleeds in neurologically stable patients may be managed conservatively , at least initially: liquefaction of the clot over 7\u201310 days after the bleed may allow for a much less invasive evacuation through burr holes. Since the dura is not as adherent to the brain as it is to the skull, subdural blood is free to expand across the brain surface, giving a diffuse concave appearance.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>SDH An acute subdural hematoma (SDH) is a clot of blood that develops between the surface of the brain and the dura mater Subdural haemorrhages are believed to be due to stretching and tearing of bridging cortical veins It cannot cross the midline CT shows crescent shaped hematoma</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Acute Subdural Haematoma Type I High-energy injury mechanisms can result in the rupture of cortical surface vessels with significant associated primary brain injury. This results in an expanding haematoma with rapid deterioration and development of signs of raised ICP reminiscent of extradural haematoma, without the lucid interval. These collections require prompt evacuation, typically by craniotomy or craniectomy. Type II : Older and often anticoagulated, a lower energy injury leads to venous bleeding around the brain. Depending on the total volume of bleeding, the resulting haematoma may present early as acute subdural haematoma, after delay and osmotic expansion as chronic subdural haematoma or may even remain clinically silent. Type III : Present much later with a further \u2018acute-onchronic\u2019 subdural haematoma. On diagnosis, the clotting function should be corrected wherever possible. Bleeds of significant size, with significantly associated midline shift or with deteriorating neurology, require urgent evacuation. Smaller bleeds in neurologically stable patients may be managed conservatively , at least initially: liquefaction of the clot over 7\u201310 days after the bleed may allow for a much less invasive evacuation through burr holes. Since the dura is not as adherent to the brain as it is to the skull, subdural blood is free to expand across the brain surface, giving a diffuse concave appearance. Chronic Subdural Hematoma : Common in the elderly, especially those on anticoagulants Clinical deficits result from the osmotic expansion of a degrading clot over days/weeks Diffuse hypodense lesion on CT Burr hole drainage is usually preferred</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Multi-infarct dementia (MID) is a common cause of memory loss in older people. MID is caused by multiple strokes (disruption of blood flow to the brain) which lead to damaged brain tissue. Some strokes may occur without noticeable symptoms; doctors may refer to these as \u201csilent strokes Option C. Meningiomas are extra-axial tumours and represent the most common tumour of the meninges . They are a non-glial neoplasm that originates from the meningocytes or arachnoid cap cells of the meninges and are located anywhere that meninges are found Option D. Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome are different conditions that often occur together. Both are due to brain damage caused by a lack of vitamin B1. Lack of vitamin B1 is common in people who have alcohol use disorder. It is also common in people whose bodies do not absorb food properly ( malabsorption ). This can sometimes occur with a chronic illness or after weight-loss (bariatric) surgery. Korsakoff syndrome, or Korsakoff psychosis, tends to develop as Wernicke encephalopathy as symptoms go away. Wernicke encephalopathy causes brain damage in lower parts of the brain called the thalamus and hypothalamus. Korsakoff psychosis results from permanent damage to areas of the brain involved with memory.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA ,</p>\n<p></p>",

If abnormal breathing is detected, management: Ventilate the patient if required. Alleviate tension pneumothorax Seal open pneumothorax. CIRCULATION WITH HEMORRHAGIC CONTROL: Assess circulation, Identify external haemorrhage Pulse BP Skin colour Identify potential internal haemorrhage. If the abnormality is detected: Apply direct pressure over the external bleeding point. Insert 2 large bore iv canula. Simultaneously obtain blood for blood transfusion and cross match Initiate iv fluids. Consider the potential need for operative management. DISABILITY: Assess consciousness Use GCS score. Assess pupils Size/ equality/ reaction. EXPOSURE / ENVIRONMENT: Completely undress the patient but prevent hypothermia. Anterior and posterior nasal packing should be done to prevent nasal bleeding. Resuscitation of patients with hypovolemic shock begins by making the airway secure by ensuring proper ventilation and oxygen therapy. External bleeding is done by the application of pressure and surgical control. Immediately life-threatening pulmonary injuries should be early detected and treated as soon as possible. Large bore iv cannula to prevent hypovolemic shock The chest X-ray is of utmost importance in cases with pulmonary injuries. Trauma resuscitation (1:1:1) packed cells, plasma, and platelets are used in this ratio. Because most patients do not require more than 6 units of PRBCs, most do not receive FFP. For patients who require more units of PRBCs, 7-12 units of PRBCs should be administered along with 6 units of FFP and 1 unit of apheresis platelets. Preferably, FFP and platelets should be transfused first, before the next 6 units of PRBCs are transfused. Adjuncts to primary survey: Blood investigations ECG, pulse oximetry, ABG Urinary and gastric catheterisation Radiographs - x rays Specialised imaging such as CT scans, angiography etc are done after secondary survey after patient is stabilised by initial resuscitation. #EXTRAEDGE The Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) system delineates an order of priorities defned by ABCD; that is, airway, breathing, circulation and disability (neurology). This hierarchy of priorities is based on the \u2018time dependence\u2019 principle. In such settings, time is critical, so the normal history and physical investigations are not performed during the ATLS primary survey, but the primary focus is on detecting and identifying individual problems , ranking them in order of priority and dealing with them efectively and efciently in their appropriate timeframes</p>\n<p></p>",

Haemorrhage after appendectomy can be prevented by ligating the inferior branch of the ileocolic artery.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The appendicular artery is a branch of the lower division of the ileocolic artery. It enters the mesoappendix, located a short distance from the base of the appendix, by passing behind the terminal ileum. Typically, the appendicular artery is an \"end-artery,\" meaning that thrombosis of this artery can result in necrosis of the appendix (gangrenous appendicitis). After an appendectomy, there is a risk of internal hemorrhage or bleeding insid e the body. The appendicular artery is the primary blood supply to the appendix. If the bleeding is coming from the site of the appendix, the appendicular artery is likely the source of the bleed. Ligating or tying off the appendicular artery can help to control the bleeding and prevent further hemorrhage. Other arteries in the area, such as the right colic artery, middle colic artery, or superior mesenteric artery, may also be sources of bleeding, but are less likely to be ligated as they supply other parts of the colon and small intestine. The decision of which artery to ligate should only be made based on the individual patient's specific condition, including the location and severity of the bleed, and the overall health status of the patient.</p>\n<p></p>",
