It is also found in cervico-vaginal secretions in early pregnancy (less than 22 weeks) and late pregnancy (greater than 37 weeks). The presence of fFN in cervico-vaginal secretions between 22 and 37 weeks is used as a predictor of preterm labor.</li><li>\u2022 A fFN level greater than 50 ng/mL is considered a significant predictor of preterm labor.

But tissue diagnosis is not a prerequisite for treatment, and hence, based on the available evidence a high inguinal orchidectomy is done in this case. Further treatment is followed up based on the findings of the excisional biopsy.</li><li>\u27a4 NSGCTs are not radiosensitive, but they are highly sensitive to combination chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cis-platinum (BEP chemotherapy). Up to 30% of NSGCT patients with stage I disease have subclinical metastases and will relapse if surveillance alone is done after orchidectomy. Accordingly, some NSGCTs with good prognoses can be managed by surveillance protocols (using regular CT scanning and tumor marker measurement), with the more high-risk cases receiving chemotherapy. For NSGCTs a 5-year survival rate of more than 90% is achievable in patients with good prognosis tumors, while for more advanced tumors, the 5-year survival rate is about 60%.</li><li>\u27a4 NSGCTs are not radiosensitive, but they are highly sensitive to combination chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cis-platinum (BEP chemotherapy).

A) Achalasia cardia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Achalasia cardia, commonly referred to as achalasia, is a medical condition that affects the esophagus, specifically the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the muscles of the esophageal wall. This condition is characterized by the following features:</li><li>\u27a4 Failure of LES Relaxation: In achalasia, the LES, a muscular ring that separates the esophagus from the stomach, does not relax properly during swallowing. Normally, the LES should relax to allow food and liquids to pass into the stomach, but in achalasia, this relaxation is impaired. Incomplete Emptying of the Esophagus: Due to the dysfunctional LES, the esophagus is unable to empty food and liquids into the stomach efficiently. This leads to a gradual buildup of food and fluids in the esophagus, causing symptoms. Difficulty in Swallowing: The most prominent symptom of achalasia is dysphagia, which is difficulty in swallowing. Patients often experience a sensation of food getting stuck in the chest while eating and may need to drink fluids or change their body position to help food pass into the stomach. Regurgitation: As a result of the esophageal emptying problems, patients with achalasia may also experience regurgitation of undigested food, often occurring at night when lying down. Chest Pain: Some individuals with achalasia may experience chest pain or discomfort, often due to the accumulation of food and fluids in the esophagus.</li><li>\u27a4 Failure of LES Relaxation: In achalasia, the LES, a muscular ring that separates the esophagus from the stomach, does not relax properly during swallowing.

It is the primary surgical treatment for achalasia. Pneumatic Dilation: In this non-surgical procedure, a balloon is inflated within the LES to stretch and disrupt the muscle fibers, making it easier for food to pass. Botulinum Toxin Injection: Injecting botulinum toxin directly into the LES can help relax the muscle temporarily.

Lordosis</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Lordosis refers to the inward (anterior) curvature of the spine. It's the normal anatomical curvature seen in the lumbar (lower back) and cervical (neck) regions. In the lumbar region, lordosis allows for an upright posture and helps to evenly distribute the body's weight and the forces exerted on the spine. While a certain degree of lumbar lordosis is normal and healthy, excessive lordosis (often called \"swayback\") can lead to pain and other issues.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Scoliosis: Scoliosis refers to a lateral (side-to-side) curvature of the spine. While any part of the spine can be affected, scoliosis most commonly develops in the thoracic (upper/mid back) and/or lumbar (lower back) regions. It's important to note that while scoliosis can affect the lumbar spine, it is not the normal anatomical curvature for that region. Instead, it's a pathological condition which can be idiopathic (most common, especially in adolescents), congenital, or secondary to other conditions.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Scoliosis:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Kyphosis: Kyphosis describes a forward (anterior) rounding or curvature of the spine, producing a \"hunchback\" appearance. The normal anatomical region that displays kyphosis is the thoracic spine (upper/mid back). When present in the lumbar spine, it is considered pathological and is usually secondary to conditions like osteoporosis (which causes compression fractures), degenerative diseases, or other spine disorders.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Kyphosis:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Recurvatum: Recurvatum typically refers to a backward bending or hyperextension of a joint. While this term can be applied to various joints in the body, it's most commonly associated with the knee joint, where the knee bends backward excessively. It doesn't directly pertain to the natural anatomical curvatures of the spine.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Level 5 is further divided into Level 5A (located above the cricoid) and Level 5B (located below the cricoid to the clavicle).

Biliary atresia is a rare and serious liver disease that affects neonates. In this condition, the bile ducts (intra/extrahepatic) are obliterated at birth.</li><li>\u27a4 The Portoenterostomy procedure involves the surgical creation of a new pathway for bile to flow from the liver into the small intestine. This is done by connecting a loop of the jejunum directly to the liver, allowing bile to bypass the blocked or absent bile ducts. The goal of the procedure is to restore bile flow and prevent liver damage, as untreated biliary atresia can lead to liver failure. Ideal management of high grades of biliary atresia (Kasai type 3) is liver transplant.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

It is named so because of its projections called dermal papillae that interlock with the rete ridges of the epidermis.</li><li>\u2022 These dermal papillae increase the surface area between the epidermis and dermis, allowing for better nutrient exchange and anchoring. Meissner corpuscles, also known as tactile corpuscles, are located in the papillary dermis, especially in areas sensitive to light touch, such as the fingertips and lips. They are oval-shaped mechanoreceptors that are sensitive to fine touch and low-frequency vibration.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Reticular dermis: The reticular dermis is the deeper and thicker layer of the dermis, located beneath the papillary dermis.

Reticular dermis:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Basal epidermis: The basal epidermis, or stratum basale, is the innermost layer of the epidermis. It consists of a single layer of columnar or cuboidal keratinocytes. These cells are continuously dividing and pushing older cells upwards towards the skin surface. The basal layer also contains melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin, and Merkel cells, another type of tactile mechanoreceptor. However, Meissner corpuscles are not found in this layer.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Basal epidermis:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Stratum lucidum: The stratum lucidum is a thin, clear layer of the epidermis, typically found only in areas of thick skin such as the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. It lies between the stratum corneum (outermost layer) and the stratum granulosum. The stratum lucidum is made up of dead, flat keratinocytes that have a translucent appearance.

Thermal dilution technique: The thermal dilution technique is a method used primarily with a pulmonary artery catheter (also known as a Swan-Ganz catheter). Cold saline is injected into the right atrium, and the change in blood temperature is measured as it passes a thermistor in the pulmonary artery. The degree of temperature change allows for the calculation of cardiac output. This method is invasive and provides continuous or intermittent measurements, depending on the specific catheter and monitor used.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Thermal dilution technique:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Esophageal Doppler: The esophageal Doppler uses ultrasound waves to measure blood flow velocity in the descending aorta via a probe placed in the esophagus.
