Because of varying localization of the mature S. mansoni worms, focal granulomas and fibrosis may occur in any part of the intestinal tract, but these are found most frequently in the rectosigmoid colon because the preferred habitat of adult S. mansoni is in the tributaries of the inferior mesenteric vein. These lesions can lead to clinical symptoms of diarrhea, hematochezia and abdominal pain. Pathology in the small bowel is not as severe as that in the large gut. In late-stage infections, particularly in Egypt and Brazil, autopsy studies suggest a shift in egg deposition from the colon to the small intestine.

Protein antigens, by virtue of CD40L- and cytokine-mediated helper T-cell actions, induce the production of antibodies of different classes, or isotypes (IgG, IgA, IgE ), a process called isotype switching. Helper T cells also stimulate the production of antibodies with high affinities for the antigen. This process, called affinity maturation, improves the quality of the humoral immune response. These two processes are initiated when activated B cells that receive signals from helper T cells during responses to protein antigens migrate into follicles and begin to proliferate to form germinal centers , which are the major sites of isotype switching and affinity maturation. The helper T-cells that stimulate these processes in B lymphocytes also migrate to and reside in the germinal centers and are called T follicular helper (TFH) cells.</p>\n<p></p>",

This classification is of value in distinguishing the manner in which an immune response causes tissue injury and disease, and the accompanying pathologic and clinical manifestations. The main types of hypersensitivity reactions are as follows: In immediate hypersensitivity (type I hypersensitivity), the injury is caused by Th2 cells, IgE antibodies, and mast cells and other leukocytes. Mast cells release mediators that act on vessels and smooth muscle and Proinflammatory cytokines that recruit inflammatory cells. In antibody-mediated disorders (type II hypersensitivity), secreted IgG and IgM antibodies injure cells by promoting their phagocytosis or lysis and injure tissues by inducing inflammation. Antibodies may also interfere with cellular functions and cause disease without tissue injury. In immune complex\u2013mediated disorders (type III hypersensitivity), IgG and IgM antibodies bind antigens usually in the circulation, and the antigen-antibody complexes deposit in tissues and induce inflammation. The leukocytes that are recruited (neutrophils and monocytes) produce tissue damage by release of lysosomal enzymes and generation of toxic free radicals. In cell-mediated immune disorders (type IV hypersensitivity), T lymphocytes (Th1 and Th17 cells and CD8+ CTLs) are the cause of the tissue injury Type Immune Mechanisms Histopathologic Lesions Prototypical Disorders Immediate (type I) hypersensitivity Production of IgE antibody immediate release of vasoactive amines and other mediators from mast cells; later recruitment of inflammatory cells Vascular dilation, edema, smooth muscle contraction, mucus production, tissue injury. inflammation Anaphylaxis; allergies: bronchial asthma (atopic forms) Antibody-mediated (type II) hypersensitivity Production of IgG, IgM \u2192 binds to antigen on target cell or tissue \u2192 phagocytosis or lysis of target cell by activated complement or Fc receptors; recruitment of leukocytes Phagocytosis and lysis of cells; inflammation; in some diseases, functional derangements without cell or tissue injury Autoimmune hemolytic anemia; Goodpasture syndrome Immune complex- mediated (type III) hypersensitivity Deposition of antigen-antibody complexes \u2192\u2192 complement activation \u2192 recruitment of leukocytes by complement products and Fc receptors \u2192 release of enzymes and other toxic molecules Inflammation, necrotizing vasculitis (fibrinoid necrosis) Systemic lupus erythematosus: some forms of glomerulonephritis; serum sickness; Arthus reaction Cell-mediated (type IV) hypersensitivity Activated T lymphocytes\u2192 (1) release of cytokines, inflammation and macrophage activation; (2) T cell-mediated cytotoxicity Perivascular cellular infiltrates; edema; granuloma formation; cell destruction Contact dermatitis; multiple sclerosis; type I diabetes; tuberculosis</p>\n<p></p>",

At least 16 of these species are thought to be of human origin; others have been isolated from animals and plants. In humans, four species are of primary importance: Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes pneumonia and has been associated with joint and other infections. Mycoplasma hominis sometimes causes postpartum fever and has been found with other bacteria in uterine tube infections. Ureaplasma urealyticum is a cause of nongonococcal urethritis in men and is associated with lung disease in pre- mature infants of low birth weight. Mycoplasma genitalium is closely related to M pneumoniae and has been associated with urethral and other urogenital infections. Other members of the genus Mycoplasma are pathogens of the respiratory and urogenital tracts and joints of humans and animals. Culture of mycoplasmas that cause disease in humans requires media with serum, a metabolic substrate such as glucose or urea, and growth factors such as yeast extract. There is no one medium that is optimal for all the species because of different properties and substrate requirements . [It can grow on cell free media] Chest radiograph \u2014 The radiographic features of M. pneumoniae pneumonia are generally similar to those seen with other atypical or viral pneumonias. The most common radiographic findings on chest radiograph are reticulonodular and/or p atchy opacities, which can be unilateral or bilateral . Other findings may include a thickened bronchial shadow, streaks of interstitial infiltrates, and areas of atelectasis. Nodular infiltrates and hilar adenopathy are less common Serology Antibodies develop in humans infected with mycoplasmas and can be demonstrated by several methods. CF tests can be performed with glycolipid antigens extracted with chloroform\u2013methanol from cultured mycoplasmas. M pneumoniae and M genitalium are serologically cross-reactive using CF tests. Amoxiclav (Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid) are cell wall inhibitors. These drugs cannot act on Mycoplasma as it lacks a cell wall.</p>\n<p></p>",

Briefly, following antigen coating and immobilization to the micro plate surface, a blocking agent is added to prevent nonspecific binding by detection antibody. Next, a detection antibody directly conjugated to an enzyme (eg, HRP) is delivered to the well, followed by addition of a substrate for the enzyme. After short incubation and addition of stop solution, the signal is measured on a plate reader. Direct ELISA assays have the overall easiest set-up. Indirect ELISA Assay: While similar to a direct ELISA, the indirect ELISA detects the binding antibody using a second, conjugated antibody. In general, the first few steps of a direct ELISA are followed, including immobilization and blocking. A detection antibody is added but, unlike the direct ELISA, this antibody is not conjugated. A second antibody (conjugated to an enzyme) is then added to detect this first binding antibody. Another washing step precedes the addition of a substrate and stop solution. The signal is then detected using a plate reader. The use of a secondary or secondary/tertiary antibodies for detection can lead to signal amplification but also leads to a longer, more time-consuming, and more complex procedure.</p>\n<p></p>",

Several tests are typically done over an extended period, with initial measurements serving as the baseline and subsequent measurements compared to this. Viral load measurements can differ daily, and therefore long-term trends are used to evaluate disease progression. There are three main tests used to measure viral load. These are reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests , branched DNA (bDNA) test s, and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) tests. These tests report viral load results differently, which means it is crucial to be consistent in the test used throughout the monitoring.</p>\n<p></p>",

Scrub typhus, first described in Japan in 1899, caused by Orientia Tsutsugamushi (formerly Rickettsia), is an acute infectious disease of variable severity that is transmitted to humans by an arthropod vector of the Trombiculidae family. It affects people of all ages including children. Humans are accidental hosts in this zoonotic disease. Isolating O. Tsutsugamushi requires biosafety level-3 facilities and culture on cell monolayers; median time to positivity is 27 days. Mouse inoculation is even more laborious and intensive on resources. Therefore, O Tsutsugamushi requires living cells to grow. It doesn\u2019t grow on regular culture media.</p>\n<p></p>",

Most common cause is Isospora spp. (option A) Kinyon\u2019s acid-fast stain (Cold method): Cryptosporidium and Isospora have been recognized as causes of severe diarrhea in immunocompromised hosts but can also cause diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts. Unlike the Ziehl-Neelsen modified acid-fast stain, Kinyon\u2019s stain does not require the heating of reagents for staining. Cryptosporidium Parvum: The infective form of the parasite is oocyst. The oocyst is spherical or oval and measures about 5 \u00b5m in diameter. Oocysts does not stain with iodine and is acid fast After fertilization, the zygote formed develops into the oocyst. The oocysts undergo sporogony to form sporulated oocyst, which contain 4 sporozoites. Sporulated oocysts are released into the feces and transmit the infection from one person to another. Some of the oocysts have a thin wall surrounding 4 sporozoites and are called thin-walled oocysts. These oocysts infect the same host and maintain the cycle of autoinfection . The oocysts are fully mature on release and are infective immediately without further development</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have also been linked to contaminated recreational water, such as parks and swimming areas. In most human cryptosporidiosis studies , C. hominis is the major causative species .</p>\n<p></p>",

Clinical Features of Shigellosis: After an incubation period of up to 1 week, Shigella causes self-limited disease characterized by 7 to 10 days of diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. The initially watery diarrhea progresses to a dysenteric phase in approximately 50% of patients , and constitutional symptoms can persist for as long as 1 month. Duration of symptoms is typically shorter in children, but severity is often much greater. In adults, an uncommon subacute presentation includes weeks of waxing and waning diarrhea that can mimic new- onset ulcerative colitis. Confirmation of Shigella infection requires stool culture. Antibiotic treatment shortens both the clinical course and the duration of bacterial shedding in stools. Conversely, antidiarrheal medications can prolong symptoms and delay Shigella clearance and are therefore contraindicated. Long-term complications of Shigella infection are uncommon but include a triad of sterile reactive arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis that preferentially affects HLA-B27\u2013positive men between 20 and 40 years of age. S. dysenteriae serotype 1 that secrete Shiga toxin may also trigger hemolytic-uremic syndrome, although Entero hemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are more commonly responsible. Toxic megacolon and intestinal obstruction are uncommon complications. Reactive Arthritis: Reactive arthritis is defined by the triad of arthritis, nongonococcal urethritis or cervicitis, and conjunctivitis following an infection. More recently, the definition has been broadened to include mono- or oligo articular arthritis that occurs days to weeks after genitourinary (Chlamydia) or gastrointestinal (Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, and C. difficile) infection .</p>\n<p></p>",
