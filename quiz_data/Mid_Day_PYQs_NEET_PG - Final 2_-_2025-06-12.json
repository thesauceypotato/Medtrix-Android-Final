The carotid sinus is a small dilation of the internal carotid artery just above the bifurcation of the common carotid into external and internal carotid branches. These baroreceptors are specifically located in the adventitial layer of the vessel wall within this dilation. They sense changes in arterial pressure and transmit this information via the carotid sinus nerve (branch of glossopharyngeal nerve) to the medulla.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option b.

Direct Bony Invasion : This is a common route of intracranial spread of middle ear infection. Cholesteatoma or chronic infection can erode the tegmen tympani (roof of middle ear), allowing infection to spread to the middle cranial fossa causing extradural or subdural abscess. Similarly, erosion of the posterior wall can lead to cerebellar abscess.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Direct Bony Invasion</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Oval or Round Window : These are preformed pathways through which infection can spread from the middle ear to the inner ear (labyrinthitis), and then to the internal auditory canal and cerebellopontine angle through the cochlear aqueduct or internal auditory canal. The subarachnoid space can be accessed through the cochlear aqueduct, which connects the scala tympani with the subarachnoid space.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Oval or Round Window</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Spread via Bloodstream : Hematogenous spread is another valid route where infection spreads through venous channels, particularly through emissary veins or by thrombophlebitis of the sigmoid sinus. This can lead to lateral sinus thrombosis, meningitis, or brain abscess.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Spread via Bloodstream</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 While middle ear infections can spread to intracranial structures through direct bone erosion, preformed pathways (oval/round windows), and bloodstream, there is no lymphatic route for such spread since the brain lacks traditional lymphatics.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
