As an intern, you engage in conversation with her, and during the chat, the baby grasps a toy and brings it to their mouth, demonstrating a developmental milestone. The mother, cautious about hygiene, quickly removes the toy from the baby's grasp. This event leads you to reflect on the developmental milestones pertaining to fine motor skills. At what age does an infant typically develop a mature pincer grasp?",
