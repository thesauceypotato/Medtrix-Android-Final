      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Paralysis agitans Marked structure - substantia nigra- Parkinson\u2019s (paralysis agitans) Parkinson's disease is a slowly progressive disorder that affects movement, muscle control, and balance. Part of the disease process develops as cells are destroyed in certain parts of the brain stem, particularly the crescent-shaped cell mass known as the substantia nigra. Nerve cells in the substantia nigra send out fibers to tissue located on both sides of the brain. There the cells release essential neurotransmitters that help control movement and coordination. Parts of Midbrain</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The substantia nigra (SN) is a basal ganglia structure located in the midbrain that plays an important role in reward and movement. Substantia nigra means \"black substance\", reflecting the fact that parts of the substantia nigra appear darker than neighboring areas due to high levels of neuromelanin in dopaminergic neurons. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Depression According to researchers, Depression causes are due to specific brain chemicals \u2014 nerve cell connections, nerve cell growth, and the functioning of nerve circuits having a major impact on depression. Option: B. Alzheimer's In the Alzheimer's brain, abnormal levels of this naturally occurring protein clump together to form plaques that collect between neurons and disrupt cell function. It is formed from the breakdown of a larger protein, called amyloid precursor protein. One form, beta-amyloid 42, is thought to be especially toxic. Option: D. Huntington's chorea Huntington's chorea disease attacks areas of the brain that help to control voluntary (intentional) movement, as well as other areas. People living with HD develop uncontrollable dance-like movements (chorea) and abnormal body postures, as well as problems with behavior, emotion, thinking, and personality.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The substantia nigra, along with four other nuclei, is part of the basal ganglia. It is the largest nucleus in the midbrain, lying dorsal to the cerebral peduncles. The SN is divided into two parts: the pars reticulata (SNpr) and the pars compacta (SNpc), which lies medial to the pars reticulata. Sometimes, a third region, the pars lateralis, is mentioned, though it is usually classified as part of the pars reticulata. The (SNpr) and the internal globus pallidus (GPi) are separated by the internal capsule .</p>\n<p></p>",
