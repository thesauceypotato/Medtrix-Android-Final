Renal According to the classification of acute kidney injury, there is no separate Classification as renal and hence this cannot be the Answer Option: C. Post renal Post-renal AKI occurs when the normally unidirectional flow of urine is acutely blocked either partially or totally B. Some examples include ureteric obstruction, obstructions of the bladder neck, and urethra Option: D.
