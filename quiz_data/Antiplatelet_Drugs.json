Although platelet transfusion is commonly used to treat thrombocytopenia, this procedure can cause adverse reactions in the recipient; furthermore, a significant number of patients fail to exhibit the expected increase in platelet count. Thrombopoietin (TPO) and IL-11 both appear to be key endogenous regulators of platelet production. An oral thrombopoietin-receptor agonist used to treat ITP by stimulating platelet production It is an orally active small nonpeptide thrombopoietin agonist molecule approved for therapy of patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia who have had an inadequate response to other therapy and for treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with hepatitis C to allow initiation of interferon therapy. Eltrombopag is excreted primarily in the feces. Eltrombopag interacts with the transmembrane domain of the MPL receptor and, similarly to romiplostim, results in a dose-dependent increase in platelet count.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.Darpoetin is a recombinant erythropoietin Option: C.
