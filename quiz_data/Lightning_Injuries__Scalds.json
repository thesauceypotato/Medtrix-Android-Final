      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1,3 In the given question, the patient was burned by hot water, so it is a form of moist heat. The features in favour of moist heat from the above options are- Red line of demarcation present. The site of injury will be at the level and below the site of contact because Moist Heat example, Hot liquids, can tickle down, so the site of injury can be below the site of contact.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Charring, singing and ulceration will be absent in case of moist heat. Hence it is the wrong The cause of injury can be a heated solid body, flame or x-ray in dry heat. Hence this is also an incorrect statement.</p>\n<p></p>",
