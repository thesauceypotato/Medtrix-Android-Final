Disulfiram works by inhibiting the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, causing many of the effects of a hangover to be felt immediately following alcohol consumption. In the body, alcohol is converted to acetaldehyde, which is then broken down by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. When the dehydrogenase enzyme is inhibited, acetaldehyde builds up, causing unpleasant side effects. It causes unpleasant effects when even small amounts of alcohol are consumed and thus is not viable for use in patients who are not motivated as it is likely that they won\u2019t be well compliant due to these unpleasant side effects. These effects include flushing of the face, headache, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, weakness, blurred vision, mental confusion, sweating, choking, breathing difficulty, and anxiety.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Codeine is an opioid analgesic having specific antitussive action while Dextromethorphan is a centrally active NMDA receptor antagonist that may be effective as an antitussive. Both are centrally acting anti-tussives, and do not provide any added advantage, when combined. Hence it is an irrational drug combination. Rational fixed dose combination drugs for treatment of cough usually contain: A centrally acting anti-tussive (either codeine or dextromethorphan; not both), with Antihistamines, Decongestants and Expectorants Both of these drugs carry a risk of addiction, but it is not the reason to not give the drug. The main reason is that the combination is irrational. Both codeine and dextromethorphan have different mechanism of action, and can treat cough effectively. However, the combination of two centrally acting antitussives do not provide any added advantage to using one drug separately. Hence, the combination is irrational.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Aminoglycoside antibiotics act by binding to the 30s ribosome and inhibiting protein synthesis.

High doses (approximately 1 mg/kg/d of prednisone) should be used. High-dose dexamethasone (30 mg/d) should be used initially to treat cysticercal encephalitis. If cerebral edema resolves, patients may be treated with antiparasitic drugs later. The clinical history of seizures and the autopsy findings of multiloculated cystic lesions are suggestive of neurocysticercosis caused by T. solium (Cysticercosis cellulosae). Glucocorticoid therapy is usually started before initiating albendazole (antiparasitic drug) and continued for several days after the institution of therapy to reduce the incidence of side effects from inflammatory reactions to dead and dying cysticerci of Taenia &Miura. Albendazole is the drug of choice for neurocysticercosis. For the treatment of patients with brain parenchymal cysticerci albendazole is given as 15 mg/kg per day for 8-28 days or praziquantel 50-100 mg/kg daily in three divided doses for 15-30 days. A combination of albendazole and praziquantel given as 50 mg/kg per day is more effective in patients with more than two cystic lesions. Neurocysticercosis is the most common central nervous system parasitic infection. Cysticercosis is caused by the larval stage (Cysticercus cellulosae) of T solium. The cysticercus is surrounded by a fibrous capsule except in the eye and the ventricles of the brain. There are various types of cysticercosis based on the site affected such as Subcutaneous nodules (asymptomatic), Neurocysticercosis, Muscular cysticercosis, Ocular cysticercosis. The clinical features of neurocysticercosis include epilepsy, increased intracranial tension, hydrocephalus, psychiatric disturbances, meningoencephalitis, transient paresis, behavioral disorders aphasia, and visual disturbances.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Pharmaceutical Mnemonics Corticosteroids uses include: remember of \"MAGIC PAUL\" M ultiple sclerosis A sthma/ A llergic rhinitis and hay fever G iant cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica I nflammatory bowel disease (IBD) - including Crohn's disease and ulc. colitis C hronic obstructive pulmonary disease P ainful & inflamed joints, muscles and tendons A topic eczema U rticaria (hives) L upus Side effects of CORTICOSTEROID C ushing's syndrome O steoporosis R educed growth T hin skin I mmunosuppression C ataracts O edema S uppressed HPA axis T eratogenic E motional disturbances R ise in blood pressure O besity I ncreased hair grow D iabetes</p>\n<p></p>",

Newer drugs are Lamotrigine. Ethosuximide and Valproate are effective for the treatment of absence seizures. However, between these 2 drugs, Ethosuximide would be a better first-line treatment choice for uncomplicated typical absence seizures followed by Valproate. In a typical absence seizure, Ethosuximide is the first-line therapy and acts by blocking the calcium channel. Atypical absence seizures respond well to valproate. The decision to start antiepileptic medication must be made with great care. Most AEDs are relatively toxic and can have sedative and cognitive side effects. Children with absence seizures may need to be on medication for many years, and in some cases, for life. EEG can usually confirm the diagnosis, and the presence of spontaneous seizures can be documented on routine EEG or with longer recordings (ie, 24-hour ambulatory EEG or EEG video monitoring).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- !.

Among the given options, only Dexamethasone is shown to reduce mortality in severe Covid-19 cases. Patients with severe COVID-19 can develop a systemic inflammatory response that can lead to lung injury and multisystem organ dysfunction. It has been proposed that the potent anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids might prevent or mitigate these deleterious effects and help reduce modality. In severe cases, Dexamethasone is administered at doses of 6mg IV/PO once daily for 10 days or until hospital discharge. If Dexamethasone is not available, equivalent doses of other corticosteroids, like prednisone, methyl prednisone, or hydrocortisone may be used. There is no evidence that Favipiravir reduces modality. It reduces duration of hospitalisation in mild to moderate disease.
