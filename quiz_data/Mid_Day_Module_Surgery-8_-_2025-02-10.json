It has the effect of increasing lower esophageal sphincter (LES) basal pressure, lessening transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (TLOSR) and reducing the capacity of the gastric fundus, thereby enhancing gastric emptying. Complete fundoplication (Nissen) is associated with a higher incidence of short-term dysphagia but is most durable in reflux control. The most common side effect of fundoplication is short- term dysphagia , related presumably to tissue oedema and inflammation. It usually resolves within 3 months of surgery. Some patients may experience \u2018gas-bloat syndrome\u2019 , especially after a complete fundoplication.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is relatively rare in CD, compared with UC. Gallstones are common, as an inflamed or absent (because of resection) terminal ileum leads to reduced absorption of bile salts. Amyloidosis is common but is rarely symptomatic. Each patient with CD should have their disease phenotype (manifestations) classified according to the Montreal classification. This is important as it allows an overview of disease progression in the individual patient over time, and enables group comparisons and evaluations. The Montreal classification specifies age at diagnosis, behaviour and disease location. Perianal CD is distressing and often debilitating for patients. The most common presentation is with a perianal abscess : perianal swelling, redness and pain, followed by discharge of pus or fecal drainage to perianal skin or vagina, implying fistulae. Surgical resection will not cure CD. Surgery, therefore, focuses on managing the complications of the disease. The fundamental principle is to preserve a healthy gut and to maintain adequate function. Intestinal resection should be kept to the minimum required to treat the local consequences of disease to mitigate against the potential for short bowel syndrome .</li><li>\u27a4 The extraintestinal manifestations of CD are similar to those that occur in UC.

A venous ulcer usually has a gently sloping edge and the floor contains granulation tissue covered by a variable amount of slough and exudate. Venous leg ulcers characteristically develop in the skin of the gaiter region , the area between the muscles of the calf and the ankle. The majority of ulcers develop on the medial side of the calf, but may develop anywhere in the gaiter area.
