The dashed vertical line indicates the Delta, which is the smallest margin of inferiority that is considered not clinically significant. If the confidence interval (CI) of a result lies entirely to the right of the Benchmark line, as seen with 'A', it suggests that the new treatment is superior to the standard treatment. If the CI of a result lies entirely to the left of the Delta line, the new treatment would be considered inferior. However, 'I' is not shown on the provided graph; if it were and it were to lie entirely to the left of Delta, it would indicate inferiority. If the CI of a result, like 'E', crosses the Benchmark but does not reach the Delta, it indicates that the new treatment is not inferior to the standard treatment. For a result to be labeled as inconclusive, it would have to not cross the Benchmark (RR = 1) and not lie beyond Delta, which is not the case for 'C' here. However, this result may still be considered inconclusive if the clinical trial's predefined criteria for non-inferiority were not met. The explanation of 'C' as inconclusive is based on the clinical context, which we don't have, but if the CI does not cross the Benchmark and is not to the left of Delta, it is typically inconclusive.</li><li>\u2022 The equivalence margin graph is designed to evaluate the non-inferiority of a new treatment compared to a standard treatment:</li><li>\u2022 The solid vertical line labeled 'Benchmark' indicates the point of no difference (Relative Risk = 1).</li><li>\u2022 The dashed vertical line indicates the Delta, which is the smallest margin of inferiority that is considered not clinically significant.</li><li>\u2022 If the confidence interval (CI) of a result lies entirely to the right of the Benchmark line, as seen with 'A', it suggests that the new treatment is superior to the standard treatment.</li><li>\u2022 If the CI of a result lies entirely to the left of the Delta line, the new treatment would be considered inferior.
