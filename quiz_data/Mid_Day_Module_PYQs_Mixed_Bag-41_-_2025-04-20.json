This binding opens ligand-gated Na\u207a channels, allowing an influx of sodium ions, which depolarizes the muscle membrane and generates an action potential. The action potential travels along the motor neuron to the axon terminal, where it triggers the opening of voltage-gated Ca\u00b2\u207a channels. The entry of calcium ions into the axon terminal facilitates the exocytosis of Ach into the synaptic cleft, which then binds to receptors on the muscle fiber to propagate the signal for muscle contraction.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Ligand-gated Na\u207a channel opens \u2192 Action potential at motor end plate \u2192 Ca\u00b2\u207a entry in Axon Terminal \u2192 Ach Release: This sequence incorrectly initiates with the opening of ligand-gated Na\u207a channels before Ach is released.

Tyrosine, an amino acid, is the primary precursor for melanin synthesis. The process starts with the conversion of tyrosine to DOPA (dihydroxyphenylalanine) by the enzyme tyrosinase, followed by several steps leading to the formation of melanin. This pathway takes place in melanocytes, specialized cells found in the skin.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Tryptophan: Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and a precursor to serotonin and melatonin, but it is not directly involved in the synthesis of melanin. Tryptophan's metabolic pathway is distinct from the pathway leading to melanin production.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Tryptophan:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Phenylalanine: Incorrect, but with a caveat. While phenylalanine itself is not directly used in melanin synthesis, it is important to note that phenylalanine can be converted into tyrosine in the body. Therefore, phenylalanine can be considered an indirect precursor to melanin. However, in the context of direct involvement in melanin synthesis, tyrosine is the correct answer.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Phenylalanine:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Histidine: Histidine is another amino acid, but it is not involved in melanin synthesis. Instead, histidine plays roles in protein synthesis and the formation of histamine, a compound involved in immune responses.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
