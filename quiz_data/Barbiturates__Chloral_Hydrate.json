      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Abrus precatorius The seeds of Abrus precatorius are egg-shaped, bright scarlet colour with a large black spot at one end, 8 mm. long and 6 mm. broad, and weigh 105 mg. on average. Seeds may be white with black spots, all black, yellow or blue. The seeds contain an active principle abrin, a TOX albumen, which is similar to viperine snake venom; also present are abrine (N-methyl tryptophan), an amino acid, hemagglutinin in the cotyledons; a lipolytic enzyme, and abralin, a glucoside. All parts of the plant are poisonous. Seeds are tasteless and odourless. Abrin inhibits protein synthesis and causes cell death. Suis are produced from these seeds to attack cattle. The presentation of the poison is just like viper snake envenomation with haemorrhages into the mucosa and internal organs.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Barbiturates Blisters on the skin, often on an area of erythema, strongly suggest barbiturate poisoning. Blisters contain clear serous fluid. The rupture of a blister leaves a red, raw surface which later dries to a brown parchment-like area. They are commonly found in sites where pressure has been exerted between two skin surfaces, such as the interdigital clefts and inner aspects of the knees, buttocks, backs of thighs, calves and forearms.</p>\n<p></p>",
