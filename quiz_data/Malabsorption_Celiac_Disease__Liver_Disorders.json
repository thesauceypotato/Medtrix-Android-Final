In this syndrome, the patient develops severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia & dies by 18-24 months of age if untreated. Serum bilirubin levels should be kept below 20 mg/dl during the first months of life to prevent brain damage. Management - phototherapy, plasmapheresis & exchange transfusion are required in the initial phases. The definitive treatment is a liver transplant. Dubin-johnson syndrome (option a) is a cause of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. It is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from impaired hepatic excretion of billirubin (2-6 mg/dl). A liver biopsy is often done for the exclusion of other causes & shows brown-black pigmentation. Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 2 (option c) is also known as aria syndrome. There is a marked reduction of udp-gt. In comparison to type 1, jaundice is less severe as bilirubin level significantly decreases following the administration of phenobarbitone. Gilbert syndrome (option d) is the most common cause of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, resulting from a partial deficiency of the enzyme udp-gt. Most patients exhibit chronic, recurrent jaundice (up to 6 mg/dl). Mild fatigue, nausea, anorexia, or abdominal pain may be present.</p>\n<p></p>",
