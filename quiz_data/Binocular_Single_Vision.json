      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Binocular Vision The Worth Four Light Test, also known as the Worth's Four Dot test or W4LT is a clinical test mainly used for assessing a patient's degree of binocular vision and binocular single vision. Binocular vision involves an Image being projected by each eye simultaneously into an area in space and being fused into a single Image. The Worth Four Light Test is also used in the detection of suppression of either the right or left eye . Suppression occurs during binocular vision when the brain does not process the information received from either of the eyes . This is a common adaptation to strabismus, amblyopia and aniseikonia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Binocular vision- In view of the distance between the two eyes, it is obvious that the retinal images of both eyes cannot be identical , since each eye regards a slightly different aspect of any object observed. The two images are fused psychologically, and this fusion of the slightly diverse images, combined with other facts derived from experience, enables the person to appreciate the solidity of objects or perceive the sensation of depth or stereopsis. Assessment of binocular vision- Various tests using different mechanisms to identify the image seen by each eye are used to assess the status of binocular vision. Commonly used tests are Bagolini striated glasses , examination with a synoptophore , Worth 4-dot test and tests for stereopsis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

If the latent deviation is one of convergence, the condition is called esophoria , if that of divergence, exophoria , and if vertical, hyperphoria . If the deviation is torsional, the term cyclophoria is applied. Horizontal deviations are the most common due often to overstimulation of convergence with accommodation in hypermetropia (esophoria) or under-stimulation in myopia (exophoria) . Diagnosis: The diagnosis of heterophoria simply depends on abolishing fusion so that, without its control, the eyes assume their position of rest. The most simple is the cover test : When a distant object is regarded, and both eyes are uncovered, there is no deviation. One eye is then covered so that the eyes dissociate and the latent deviation appears. When the screen is removed, this eye moves at once to regain the position of binocular fixation . The other eye reacts similarly, with the deviation in both being the same. Other tests: Maddox rod test. : Maddox wing test( near tropias/ phorias) Treatment The lower degrees of esophoria and exophoria cause no symptoms and need no special treatment . If symptoms are apparent after any error of refraction has been corrected with spectacles , rational treatment of eso- or exophoria consists in exercising the weak muscles against prisms (with the base of the prism in the direction of deviation) or by the use of the synoptophore .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

Synoptophore tests for sensory functions include: Estimation of grades of binocular vision . Detection of normal/abnormal retinal correspondence (ARC). It is done by determining the subjective and objective angles of the squint. In normal retinal correspondence, these two angles are equal. In ARC, the objective angle is greater than the subjective angle and the difference between these is called the angle of anomaly.

It consists of the power to superimpose two incomplete but similar images to form one complete image .

It can be demonstrated by presenting separate stimuli to the two eyes, such as a cage picture to one eye and a picture of the parrot to the other eye.

Fusion: It implies the ability of two eyes to produce a composite picture from two similar pictures, each of which is incomplete with small detail . For example, there are two rabbits, each lacking a tail or a bunch of flowers. If fusion is present , one rabbit complete with a tail and holding a bunch of flowers will be seen . Stereopsis: It can obtain an impression of depth by the supreme position of two pictures of the same objects, which have been taken at slightly different angles .

Forced duction test: Positive in cases of incomitant squint due to mechanical restriction .

The test is performed under local anaesthesia but sometimes under general anaesthesia in the case of very young children. The patient is asked to look in the direction in which movement is being tested and the maximum range is noted. The eyeball is then held at the opposite limbus with toothed forceps and rotated maximally further in the same direction. Interpretation: The test is said to be positive if there is a resistance to full passive movement and negative if it is possible to passively rotate the eyeful with the forceps . A negative result on testing forced duction implies a paralytic or innervational squint . A positive forced duction test indicates a restriction due to contracture or fibrosis of the ipsilateral antagonist or an orbital space-occupying lesion preventing full movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: Option: B . To detect ocular muscle spasms - The extraocular muscle function test is performed to evaluate any weakness, or other defect in the extraocular muscles which results in uncontrolled eye movements.

To measure the angle of deviation - The alternate prism cover test (APCT) is the most frequently used method to measure the angle of deviation in patients with strabismus, but it can only be used when both eyes have sufficient vision for fixation.

The test is based on the principle of diplopic projection Maddox Rod Test involves the use of a Maddox rod and the Maddox tangent scale. It uses a specially constructed device, consisting of a series of parallel cylinders, that converts a point source of light into a line image . A patient is asked to fix on a point light 6 meters away . The optical properties of the cylinders cause the streak of light to be situated 90\u00b0 to the orientation of the parallel cylinders. Because fusion is precluded by the Maddox rod, heterophorias, and heterotopias cannot be differentiated . The Maddox rod can be used to test for horizontal and vertical deviations, and when used in conjunction with another Maddox rod, for cyclo-deviations.

The two eyes move independently of each other. The principal visual direction of the central fovea & the visual directions of the other retinal points relative to the principal direction is innate . Therefore, monocular fixation is present at birth & is poor . At 2-3 weeks of age, the infant begins to make movements of regard. At 4-5 weeks of age, he/she sustains central fixation of large near objects. At 6 weeks, fixation alternates rapidly between the two eyes and a short time later the child fixates binocularly & performs conjugate pursuit movements. Initially, pursuit movements are saccadic in character but become smooth and gliding between 3 & 5 months of age.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.A condition in which both eyes are simultaneously directed to the same targe Option: C.
