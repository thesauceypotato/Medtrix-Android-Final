      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Failure of GUT to return to the body cavity from its physiological herniation Failure of GUT to return to the body cavity from its physiological herniation. Exomphalos(omphalocele) is herniation of abdominal viscera through an enlarged umbilical ring. The viscera, which may include liver, small and large intestines, stomach, spleen, or bladder, are covered by amnion inside and amnion outside. The origin of omphalocele is a failure of the bowel to return to the body cavity from its physiological herniation during the 6th to 10th weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Exomphalos describes a central abdominal wall defect in which prolapsed viscera are covered in a thin, three-layered membrane (peritoneum, Wharton\u2019s jelly and amnion) in continuity with the umbilical cord. Association: Exomphalos minor (<5 cm, liver not involved) is commonly associated with other anomalies and the defect is easily closed. Chromosomal anomalies: Can occur in 20-50% of cases; the risk of an associated chromosomal anomaly gets higher when the omphalocele is detected earlier in gestation Trisomy 18: considered the most common associated chromosomal anomaly Trisomy 13 Trisomy 21 Turner syndrome Klinefelter syndrome Pallister-Killian syndrome Other Syndromic associations Beckwith - Wiedemann syndrome Pentalogy of Cantrell OEIS complex: O mphalocele, bladder/cloacal exstrophy, imperforate anus, spinal anomalies omphalocele-radial ray (ORR) complex Differential Diagnosis : Physiological GUT herniation: This diagnosis should only be entertained in early pregnancy prior to 11.4 weeks or in gestation with crown rump length less than 55 mm. The physiologic midgut herniation should not exceed 7 mm in diameter Gastroschisis refers to extra-abdominal herniation (evisceration) of fetal or neonatal bowel loops (and occasionally portions or the stomach and or liver) into the amniotic cavity through a para-umbilical anterior abdominal wall defect. Associated anomalies are rare in a gastroschisis (unlike an omphalocele) except for related bowel abnormalities (i.e. intestinal atresia, malrotation or stenosis from vascular compromise). A fetus with a gastroschisis may have intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) Management : In exomphalos major the sac can be dressed with a topical antibacterial agent (e.g. manuka honey, silver sulfadiazine), allowing epithelialisation and later closure of the ventral hernia. If an early closure of an exomphalos major is attempted, close observation for an abdominal compartment syndrome is mandated.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Neonatal abdominal wall defects Gastroschisis Environmental risk factors (young maternal age, drug use) Bowel complications common (atresia, matting, volvulus) Associated anomalies rare Exomphalos Frequent association with aneuploidies and other genetic syndromes (e.g. Beckwith-Wiedemann) Other structural anomalies common (e.g. cardiac malformations) Large defects may contain liver (exomphalos major) and require delayed or staged closure</p>\n<p></p>",

Granny slips- Above, Below, Above and below</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Knotting Techniques : Knot tying is one of the most fundamental techniques in surgery and a poorly constructed knot may jeopardize an otherwise successful surgical procedure General Principles : The knot must be tied firmly, but without strangulating the tissues. The knot must be as small as possible to minimize the amount of foreign material. The knot must be tightened without exerting any tension or pressure on the tissues being ligated , i.e. the knot should be bedded down carefully, only exerting pressure against counter-pressure from the index finger or thumb. The suture material must not be \u2018sawed\u2019 as this weakens the thread and cuts through delicate tissue like a cheese wire. The suture material must be laid square during tying ; otherwise, tension during tightening may cause breakage or fracture of the thread. When tying an instrument knot, the thread should only be grasped at the free end , as gripping the thread with the needle holder can damage the material, resulting in breakage or fracture. The standard surgical knot is the reef knot with a third throw for security , although with monofilament sutures six throws are required for security. When added security is required, a surgeon\u2019s knot using a two-throw technique is advisable to prevent slippage . When using a continuous suture technique, an Aberdeen knot may be used for the final knot. When the suture is cut after knotting, the ends should be left about 1\u20132 mm long to prevent unravelling . This is particularly important when using monofilament material</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option C : Square Knot  (Reef Knot) Two throws of opposite type made Right side suture run over the left and then left side suture run over the right.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Gastrinoma triangle The gastrinoma triangle, also known as Passaro\u2019s triangle. The triangle is formed by joining the following three points: Superiorly: Confluence of the cystic and common bile ducts Inferiorly: Junction of the second and third portions of the duodenum Medially: Junction of the neck and body of the pancreas GASTRINOMA: Most Common functioning malignant pancreatic endocrine tumor (Insulinoma: MC benign) A/w Zollinger Ellison syndrome Site : duodenum Presentation: peptic ulcer ,refractory diarrhea (d/t inactivation of enzyme) Diagnosis Fasting serum gastrin more than 100pg/ml BAO >15 mEq/h Secretin stimulation test Localization - Octreotide scan (SRS) is the pre-operative study of choice for gastrinoma Gastrinomas most commonly arise in 1st part of duodenum within Passaro\u2019s triangle. Those which arise out of this triangle are at increased risk of malignancy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Gastrinoma/Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (ZES) Gastrinoma/Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (ZES) is a malignant pancreatic endocrine tumor that functions abnormally. It is more commonly found in men with a mean age of 50 years . It occurs in two forms: sporadic (75%) and MEN-1 association (25%). Those associated with MEN-1 are almost always multiple, early onset, and more common in the duodenum. The most common site of Gastrinoma is the duodenum (50-70%) followed by the pancreas (20-40%). In the duodenum, the most common site is the first part, followed by the second and third parts. Gastrinoma causes increased gastrin secretion, leading to marked gastric acid hypersecretion, which can cause peptic ulcers. All gastrinomas also produce chromogranin A . The most common presenting symptoms are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and GERD . Diarrhea is caused by the inability of the intestinal tract to absorb the large volumes of fluid secreted by the stomach, acid-induced injury to the mucosa of the upper small intestine, precipitation of bile salts, and inactivation of pancreatic lipase by low pH. The diagnosis of ZES is confirmed by hypergastrinemia with increased secretion of gastric acid . Elevated serum gastrin levels alone are not sufficient to diagnose ZES; basal gastric acid hypersecretion must be demonstrated. A fasting serum gastrin level >100 pg/mL and levels >1000 pg/mL are diagnostic. Elevated serum gastrin level with a pH <2 in the gastric aspirate is almost diagnostic of ZES. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) is the imaging test of choice for localizing both primary and metastatic gastrinomas. Acid secretion is controlled by PPIs, and pharmacologic control of acid secretion with PPIs has rendered total gastrectomy and other surgical acid-reducing procedures unnecessary. The best predictor of survival for patients with gastrinoma is the presence of liver metastases . LN metastases are not predictive. Resection of all gross disease and metastases may provide palliation of symptoms and may prolong survival. Distal pancreatectomy is recommended for gastrinoma involving the body or tail of the pancreas, while pancreaticoduodenectomy is recommended for gastrinoma involving the head of the pancreas. In MEN-1 , hyperparathyroidism should be treated first because it can complicate the management of gastrinoma. Neck exploration should be performed before the resection of gastrinoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The provocative tests, such as the secretin stimulation test, calcium stimulation test, secretin-plus-calcium stimulation test, bombesin test, and protein meal test , are highly useful if the diagnosis is in doubt. The secretin provocation test is the best. An increase of >200 pg/mL in the gastrin value after administration of secretin is diagnostic. A unique characteristic of acid-induced diarrhea is that it can be halted by nasogastric aspiration of gastric secretions. Most patients have peptic ulcers (duodenal ulcers are the most common). ZES must be excluded in all patients with intractable peptic ulcers, severe esophagitis, or persistent secretory diarrhea.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is a pseudodiverticula that arises posteriorly in the midline of the neck and usually projects left laterally. The main symptom is dysphagia , with undigested food regurgitating into the mouth, swelling of the neck, gurgling noise after eating, halitosis, and a sour metallic taste in the mouth. It is usually seen in patients over 50 years and is associated with cervical webs in 50% of patients. Diagnosis is through a barium swallow , and complications include pneumonia and lung abscess due to aspiration, perforation, bleeding, and carcinoma. The treatment of choice is surgical therapy, which can include cricopharyngeal myotomy, myotomy with excision of the sac, diverticulopexy, or diverticulo-esophagostomy using a linear cutting staple gun ( also known as the Dohlman procedure). Other options: Option A: Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital anomaly of the small intestine, and the treatment depends on the presence of symptoms or complications. Surgical removal (resection) of the diverticulum is recommended in cases of symptomatic or complicated Meckel's diverticulum. Option C: Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory disorder that affects the muscles and skin. The treatment involves the use of immunosuppressive medications and corticosteroids to control inflammation and improve muscle strength. Option D: Menetrier's disease is a rare disorder characterized by the thickening of the stomach lining and the formation of large folds (rugae). Treatment involves the use of medications to decrease stomach acid secretion and promote healing of the stomach lining. Surgical resection may be considered in severe cases or when complications arise, such as bleeding or obstruction.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Comparison of Meckel\u2019s diverticulum, Zenker\u2019s diverticulum, Dermatomyositis, Menetrier\u2019s disease Meckel's Diverticulum Zenker's Diverticulum Dermatomyositis Menetrier's Disease Definition True diverticulum arising from the ileum Pseudodiverticulum arising posteriorly in the midline of the neck A connective tissue A rare, acquired hypertrophic gastropathy Location Distal ileum, near the  ileocecal valve Posterior midline of the neck Affects the skin and muscles throughout the body Fundus and body of the stomach Pathogenesis Persistence of the vitelline duct or omphalomesenteric duct during embryonic development Increased intraluminal pressure due to neuromuscular incoordination in the esophagus Unknown etiology, autoimmune-mediated Overexpression of transforming growth factor alpha in gastric mucosa Symptoms Usually asymptomatic. but can present with painless rectal bleeding, intestinal obstruction, and abdominal pain Dysphagia, regurgitation, swelling of the neck, halitosis, sour metallic taste in the mouth Symmetrical proximal muscle weakness, skin rash, dysphagia, lung involvement Early satiety, weight loss, abdominal pain. edema, diarrhea Diagnosis Technetium-99m pertechnetate scan, CT  scan, or laparoscopy Barium swallow or esophagoscopy Clinical evaluation, muscle biopsy, electromyography, skin biopsy Endoscopy, biopsy, laboratory evaluation Complications Bleeding, perforation inflammation, intussusception, and malignancy Pneumonia, lung abscess, perforation, and bleeding Interstitial lung disease, dysphagia,  respiratory failure, and malignancy Anemia, protein loss, and risk of gastric carcinoma Treatment Surgical resection of the diverticulum Cricopharyngeal myotomy, myotomy with excision of sac, diverticulopexy, or diverticulo-esophagostomy Corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, physical therapy Supportive care, H2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, surgical gastrectomy in severe cases</p>\n<p></p>",

Prospective studies of health care workers exposed to HCV through a needlestick or other percutaneous injury have found that the incidence of anti-HCV seroconversion (indicating infection) averages 1.8% (range, 0% to 7%) per injury HIV: To estimate the rate of HIV transmission, data were combined from more than 20 worldwide prospective studies of health care workers exposed to HIV-infected blood through a percutaneous injury.

Accurate measurement is via analysis of blood drawn from a long central line placed in the right atrium. (AR)Estimations can be made from blood drawn from lines in the superior vena cava, but these values will be slightly higher than those of a mixed venous sample (as there is relatively more oxygen extraction from the lower half of the body). (SMCQ)Normal mixed venous oxygen saturation levels are 50\u201370%. Levels below 50% indicate inadequate oxygen delivery and increased oxygen extraction by the cells. Consistent with hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock. Sepsis : High mixed venous saturations (>70%) are seen in sepsis and some other forms of distributive shock. In sepsis, there is disordered utilization of oxygen at the cellular level and arteriovenous shunting of blood at the microvascular level. Therefore, less oxygen is presented to the cells, and those cells cannot utilize what little oxygen is presented. Thus, venous blood has a higher oxygen concentration than normal. Patients who are septic should therefore have mixed venous oxygen saturations above 70%; below this level, they are not only in septic shock but also in hypovolaemic or cardiogenic shock. Although the SvO2 level is in the \u2018normal\u2019 range, it is low for the septic state, and inadequate oxygen is being supplied to cells that cannot utilize oxygen appropriately. This must be corrected rapidly. Management : Hypovolaemia should be corrected with fluid therapy, and low cardiac output due to myocardial depression or failure should be treated with inotropes (dobutamine) to achieve a mixed venous saturation greater than 70% (normal for the septic state).

This involves painting the affected area with iodine , which is allowed to dry before applying dry starch , which turns blue on exposure to iodine in presence of sweat . Sweating is stimulated by salivary stimulation. PREVENTION: There are a number of quite invasive techniques described to prevent Frey\u2019s syndrome following parotidectomy. These include Sternomastoid muscle flap Temporalis fascial flap Insertion of artificial membranes between the skin and the parotid bed. All these methods replace the barrier between the skin & the parotid bed to minimize inappropriate regeneration of autonomic nerve fibres. Management : Antiperspirants, usually containing aluminium chlorohydrate Denervation by tympanic neurectomy The injection of botulinum toxin into the affected skin</p>\n<p></p>",

Immediate intervention is required to relieve the pressure and restore lung function. The insertion of an intercostal drain (ICD), also known as a chest tube, is the standard treatment for tension pneumothorax. Inserting a Chest Drain Site of Insertion: Triangle of Safety Boundaries: Anterior to mid-axillary line Above level of nipple Below and Lateral to Pectoralis Major This usually gets inserted in 5th ICS level. Steps in ICD Insertion: Meticulous Sterility maintained. Insert Local Anaesthesia up to Pleura. Sharp dissection to Cut only the Skin. Blunt Dissection using Artery Forceps through the muscles - Intercostal and Serratus anterior. Oblique tract is made so that the parietal pleura is tunneled to avoid leakage of air. Drain in cases of Hemothorax and Pneumothorax should aim the Apex Drain for Empyema and Pleural effusion should be at Base Drain should pass at the upper edge of the rib to avoid injury to neurovascular bundle.

Check the drain location by a Chest X ray.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>A tension pneumothorax is caused by excessive pressure build up around the lung due to a breach in the lung surface which will admit air into the pleural cavity during inspiration but will not allow any air to escape during expiration. The breach acts as a one-way valve. This leads to lung collapse . The removal of the air is through the surgical incision by inserting an underwater drain in the pleural cavity. This excessive pressure can also prevent the heart from pumping effectively which may lead to shock.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- When it comes to the insertion of an ICD for tension pneumothorax, the following statements are generally true: OPTION A.

OPTION B. Direction of insertion is posterior and superior: The ICD is inserted in a direction that is posterior (towards the back) and superior (upwards) to ensure proper placement in the pleural space.
