Once inside, it divides into anterior and posterior branches. The anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery ascends vertically to supply the dura and the calvaria. Importantly, this artery courses in close proximity to the pterion.

However, the MCA and its divisions run deep within the brain, within the depths of the lateral sulcus and over the insular cortex.

The superior head attaches to the articular disc and the capsule of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). This muscle plays a crucial role in the opening of the mouth, protrusion of the mandible, and moving the jaw from side to side. Dysfunction or spasms of this muscle could contribute to jaw locking during yawning.

Medial pterygoid:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Masseter: The masseter muscle is one of the primary muscles of mastication (chewing). It originates from the zygomatic arch and inserts onto the lateral aspect of the mandibular angle and ramus. Its primary function is to elevate the mandible, assisting in closing the mouth.
