Due to which surface tension increases and compliance decreases.</li><li>\u2022 Surfactant (Lecithin/Dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl Choline) is produced by specialized cells called type II alveolar cells in the lungs. Surfactant molecules have a hydrophilic (water-attracting) head and a hydrophobic (water-repellent) tail. This unique structure allows surfactant to lower the surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveoli. It reduces the attractive forces between water molecules, preventing the alveoli from collapsing during expiration.</li><li>\u2022 Compliance refers to the ability of the lungs to expand and recoil efficiently during breathing. Without surfactant, the surface tension within the alveoli would be high, making it difficult for the lungs to inflate during inspiration and causing them to collapse more readily during expiration.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective</li><li>\u27a4 In preterm infants, especially those born before the lungs have matured at around 28 weeks, the lack of adequate surfactant leads to increased surface tension and decreased compliance, contributing to the development of respiratory distress syndrome.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

This triad represents the most characteristic manifestations of maternal rubella infection during pregnancy, especially when infection occurs during the first trimester. While mental retardation can occur in children with CRS, it is not part of the classical diagnostic triad but rather an additional manifestation that may be present in severe cases.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Cataract - Correct component of the CRS triad. Cataracts are typically bilateral but can be unilateral and develop from damage to the developing lens during embryogenesis.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Cataract</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Deafness - Correct component of the CRS triad. Sensorineural hearing loss is the most common manifestation of CRS, affecting up to 80% of infected infants.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Deafness</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Heart Defects - Correct component of the CRS triad.
