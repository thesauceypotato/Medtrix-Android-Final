This indicates fixed obstruction in upper airway/central airway FEV1/FVC is <0.7 and There is bronchodilator reversibility, since the FEV1 value increased to 12% after bronchodilator therapy. Thus we can say that the patient has obstructive etiology with response to bronchodilator leading to positive bronchodilator reversibility. FEV1 is the forced expiratory volume in one second or the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in one second, after full inspiration.

Obstructive lung disease is characterized by airway obstruction and it is associated with inflammation of the airways and problems exhaling. Types of obstructive lung disease include:- asthma, bronchiectasis and COPD (chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema). Obstructive lung disease results in air trapping in the lungs which expands the lung volume over time. A decrease in the FEV1/FVC ratio suggests an obstructive condition.</p>\n<p></p>",

Hyperkinetic movements are not typically seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Chorea Ballismus Athetosis Rapid Rapid Slow Involuntary Involuntary Involuntary Non-stereotypical Non-stereotypical Non-stereotypical Semi-purposeful / non- purposeful Non-purposeful Non-purposeful Dance-like violent flinging movement writing More on distal More on proximal Has propensity affecting upper limb</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Huntington's Disease or HD is a progressive or degenerative brain disorder or also known as a Neurodegenerative . Huntington's slowly diminishes the ability to think, walk, and talk . Chorea are jerking motions which is a developed symptom of HD . HD slowly ruins the nerves in your brain. Etiology and Pathophysiology Inherited disorder, considered autosomal dominant Progressive atrophy of the basal ganglia and some portions od the cerebral cortex Appears during the middle adult years Onset usually occurs between the age of 30-50, death usually follow 12 years after onset</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA TRD Mode of inheritance Repeats involved Examples of presentation Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy Autosomal dominant CAG\u226549 Chromosome 12 Symptom onset is variable and depends on trinucleotide repeat length; can present with ataxia, dementia, depression, anxiety, chorea, etc. Fragile-X syndrome X-linked dominant CGG>200 Intellectual disability, epilepsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autistic-like features Friedreich's ataxia Autosomal recessive GAA\u226570 Chromosome 9 Progressive ataxia, dysarthria, depression, etc. Huntington's disease Autosomal dominant CAG\u226540 Chromosome 4 Chorea, dementia, depression Myotonic dystrophy Autosomal dominant CTG>50 Chromosome 19 Intellectual disability or psychiatric symptoms can occur but main presentation is usually with muscle weakness, etc. Spinobulbar muscular atrophy X-linked recessive CAG\u226538 Progressive muscles weakness and atrophy, fasciculation, etc. Spinocerebellar ataxia Autosomal dominant Various, depending on the subtype Variability in age at onset dependent on trinucleotide repeat length. Psychosis and dementia can occur with some subtypes, but progressive ataxia is the main presentation</p>\n<p></p>",
