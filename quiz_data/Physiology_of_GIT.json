The major endocrine involved is gastrin released from G cells in the antrum. Normally, as gastric acid lowers gastric pH to around 3, somatostatin is secreted by cells located next to the G cells to inhibit further gastrin release.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>B In a patient with lactose intolerance, there is no rise in serum glucose levels but the breath hydrogen and internal methane production would increase because of the metabolism of lactose by the intestinal bacteria. Patients with lactase deficiency cannot digest milk products that contain lactose (milk sugar). The operons of gut bacteria quickly switch over to lactose metabolism, which results in fermentation that produces copious amounts of gas (a mixture of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane). This gas, in turn, may cause a range of abdominal symptoms including stomach cramps, bloating, and flatulence. The gas is absorbed by blood (especially in the colon) and exhaled from the lungs. Blood glucose levels do not increase because lactose is not digested into glucose and galactose in these patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Lactose intolerance also called lactase deficiency or hypolactasia, is the inability to digest and metabolize lactose, a sugar found in milk. Lactose intolerance is not an allergy because it is not an immune response but is caused by lactase deficiency. Primary lactase deficiency is a genetically determined absence or decrease in the enzyme is noted. Jejunal morphology is normal. In non caucasian groups, primary lactase deficiency is abnormal in adulthood. Secondary, acquired, or transient lactase deficiency is due to the small intestinal mucosal disease, abnormalities of brush border cells, and transport processes. It is often associated with celiac sprue.</p>\n<p></p>",

Zollinger\u2013Ellison syndrome: This syndrome is seen in patients with gastrinomas secreting gastrin. These tumors can occur in the stomach and duodenum, but most of them are found in the pancreas.

Herring-Breuer inflation reflex: It is triggered to prevent the over-inflation of the lung. Pulmonary stretch receptors present on the wall of the bronchi and bronchioles of the airways respond to excessive stretching of the lung during large inspirations. Once activated, they send action potentials through large myelinated fibers of the vagus nerve to the inspiratory area in the medulla and apneustic center of the pons. In response, the inspiratory area is inhibited directly and the apneustic center is inhibited from activating the inspiratory area. This inhibits inspiration, allowing expiration to occur. Option B. Juxta pulmonary capillary (J) receptor reflex: Juxtacapillary receptors, J-receptors, or pulmonary C-fiber receptors are sensory nerve endings located within the alveolar walls in juxtaposition to the pulmonary capillaries of the lung, and are innervated by fibers of the vagus nerve. The stimulation of the J-receptors causes a reflex increase in breathing rate and is also thought to be involved in the sensation of dyspnea, the subjective sensation of difficulty breathing. The reflex response that is produced is apnea followed by rapid breathing, bradycardia, and hypotension (pulmonary chemoreflex). Option C. Irritant airway reflex: Rapidly adapting receptors (RARs) occur throughout the respiratory tract from the nose to the bronchi. In the larynx are usually called 'irritant' receptors. They probably cause cough, the expiration reflex, and other laryngeal reflexes: cardiovascular, mucus secretion, bronchoconstrictor, and laryngo constrictor. Those in the trachea and larger bronchi are very mechanosensitive; they cause cough, bronchoconstriction, and airway mucus secretion.</p>\n<p></p>",

The portion of the ileum containing the ileocecal valve projects slightly into the cecum , so that increases in colonic pressure squeeze it shut, whereas increases in ileal pressure open it. It is normally closed. Each time a peristaltic wave reaches it, it opens briefly, permitting some of the ileal Chyme to squirt into the cecum. When food leaves the stomach, the cecum relaxes, and the passage of Chyme through the ileocecal valve increases (gastro ileal reflex). This is presumably a vagal reflex.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The primary functions of the ileocecal valve are to separate ileal and colonic contents, thereby minimizing bacterial colonization of the small intestine, and to regulate the emptying of ileal contents into the colon.
