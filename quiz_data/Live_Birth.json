      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Precipitate Labour Labour terminating in a very short time than taken on the average, either in primiparae or multiparae is called Precipitate Labour. In this, delivery occurs suddenly and rapidly without any knowledge of the mother. All 3 steps of labour are merged into one. It is possible in multiparae with a large roomy pelvis, but very rare in primiparae. They may not be able to distinguish the sense of fullness produced by the descent of a child from the feeling of evacuation. The child may die from - Suffocation by falling into the lavatory pan, head injury, and fracture of the skull with subdural haemorrhage often bilateral, by a fall on a hard floor or haemorrhage from the torn fetal end of the cord. MLI - Mother may be falsely charged with Infanticide; Mother may actually kill the child and blame it on precipitate labour. Precipitate Labour - Here all three stages of labour are merged into one thereby labour happening in a very short period of time thereby happening rapidly even without the knowledge of the The process of labour is usually complete within 3 hrs.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A . Stillborn - A stillborn child is born after 28 weeks of pregnancy and does not breath or show any other signs of life at any time after being completely born. Option: B. Dead-born - The child here dies in Utero and shows the following signs after it is born- Rigor Mortis, Robert Sign, Maceration, Spalding\u2019s Sign, and Mummification. Option: D. Liveborn - If the fetus gets delivered after 28 weeks and respires at least once is known as liveborn. Various tests are present to confirm it - Wredin\u2019s Test, Breslau\u2019s 2nd life test, Plocquet\u2019s test, etc.</p>\n<p></p>",

Before birth, the middle ear contains gelatinous embryonic connective tissue but no air. With respiration, the sphincter at the pharyngeal end of the Eustachian tube relaxes and air replaces the gelatinous substance in a few hours to five weeks. The middle ear must be opened under water by removing tegmen tympani. A bubble of air comes out if the test is Positive. These changes in the Middle Ear are tested by Wredin\u2019s Test.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Fodere\u2019s Test - Also known as Static Test. The lungs are ligated across their hila and separated. The average weight of both lungs before respiration varies from 30-40g and after respiration from 60-66g. The increase in weight is due to the increased flow of blood. Option: C.

It is based on the Specific gravity of the lung tissue comparative of before and after respiration. The lung tissue floats in water along with a piece of liver used as a control. If the lungs float separately, then they are cut into 12-20 small pieces and then submerged again in water. Now if they float, they are squeezed above a sponge and then submerged again. Now if they float, it is indicative of Livebirth as the lungs then contain some residual air. There may be some fallacies as in both respired lungs but not floating and also in non-respired lungs but floating., False -ve and False +ve respectively. The expanded lungs may sink from- Atelectasis (non-expansion) of the lungs due to air not entering the lungs due to feeble respiration, acute edema, pneumonia, congenital syphilis, complete absorption of air from the lungs by the blood( if circulation continued after stoppage of respiration), obstruction by Alveolar duct membrane.
