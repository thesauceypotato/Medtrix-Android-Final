Previously, treatment of idiopathic central precocious puberty was with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Currently, the most effective treatment for central precocious puberty is the use of a long-acting GnRH agonist, such as leuprolide (Lupron) and others. During the first 1 or 2 weeks of therapy, there is a flare-up effect of increased gonadotropins and sex steroids, a predicted side effect of these medications.

After a decade of quiescence, pulsatile secretion of GnRH increases and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is reactivated (gonad arche), probably in response to metabolic signals from the periphery. FSH and LH levels rise moderately before age 10, followed by a gradual increase in estradiol concentrations, which stimulate breast development (thelarche).

McCune-Albright Syndrome is characterized by the c lassic triad of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia of bone, irregular caf\u00e9 au lait spots on the skin and GnRH-independent sexual precocity Precocious puberty is the result of the secretion of estrogen from functioning ovarian cysts. The caf\u00e9 au lait spots are usually large, do not cross the midline and have irregular \u201ccoast of Maine\u201d margins. They are located on the same side as the bony lesion Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome is hypothalamic amenorrhea+ mental retardation + polydactyl + retinitis pigmentosa. Fr\u00f6hlich Syndrome is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism + obesity + genital hypoplasia Both these are causes of delayed puberty and not precocious puberty</p>\n<p></p>",
