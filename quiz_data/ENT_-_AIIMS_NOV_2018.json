      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>BPPV BBPV is the best answer. Vertigo with change in head position is characteristic of BPPV.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo in clinical practice. The patient complains of episodic vertigo lasting for seconds in certain head positions. Hearing is absolutely normal. Pathogenesis BPPV occurs because of free floating debris in the endolymph of posterior semicircular canal. The free floating debris moves in certain head positions, stimulating the cupula leading to vertigo. This vertigo disappears when the debris settles down in 10\u201320 seconds. Most common cause is head trauma. Other causes are middle ear infection, viral  labyrinthitis,  and  prolonged bed rest. Diagnosis It is diagnosed by doing Hallpike Test which is an appositional test. In this test, the nystagmus is watched for while changing the position of the head of the patient while sitting and lying down. Management Epley\u2019s maneuver or canalith repositioning maneuver: This Involves repositioning the debris from posterior semicircular canal back into the utricle by placing the patient\u2019s head in a sequence of five positions. Meniere\u2019s Disease It is also known as endolymphatic hydrops. It is frequently a unilateral condition and is seen more commonly in young females (20\u201340 years). It is largely idiopathic. Clinical Features Vertigo: It is the first  symptom  of  Meniere\u2019s  disease  and  lasts  for  at  least  20 minutes till a maximum of up to 24 hours. This sudden onset of vertigo of Meniere\u2019s disease is associated with vagal symptoms, i.e., nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and bradycardia. SN hearing loss and tinnitus can be seen. Investigations Rinne test: Positive Weber test: Toward the normal ear ABC: Shortened Schwabach: Shortened Recruitment: Positive SISIS: 70\u2013100% (because of recruitment) Management Salt and water restrictions Labyrinthine sedatives Vasodilators Meniett device Vestibular neuronitis This condition is characterized by acute onset vertigo, nystagmus and tinnitus with nausea and vomiting lasting for days to weeks. This is most likely because of the viral infection involving the vestibular nerve. The cochlear part is not involved, so the hearing remains normal. The caloric test shows diminished response. It is managed by labyrinthine sedatives.</p>\n<p></p>",
