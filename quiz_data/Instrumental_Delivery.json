P/V examination findings are \u2013 os fully dilated, 70% effaced, membranes ruptured, the pelvis is adequate, and the fetal head station is +2. The uterine contractions are adequate at a rate of 3/10 min for 30 sec. After 45 minutes of full dilatation, now the mother is exhausted. The fetal heart rate was 100, with no beat-to-beat variability. She is a known case of grade 2 NYHA heart failure. Hence she was delivered with the help of a forceps application. Which of the following is not an indication of forceps delivery in the above question?",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>45 minutes after full dilatation According to the given scenario, a prolonged second stage of labour (nullipara>2 hours, multipara >1 hour) is the indication and not 45 minutes. Hence it is incorrect.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Criteria for forceps delivery: Favourable position and station. OS fully dilated. The cervix is fully dilated. Membranes ruptured. The head of the baby rotated. Uterus contracting. Episiotomy given. Head engaged. Bladder empty. Adequate pelvis. No CPD.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option A . Non-reassuring fetal heart rate, fetal distress eg: low birth weight, postmaturity. Option B. Maternal effects like maternal exhaustion, and inadequate expulsion efforts, where expulsive efforts are to be avoided cardiac disease, hypertensive crises, cerebrovascular diseases, and spinal cord injuries. Option D. Known cases of grade 2 NYHA heart failure are an important indication to cut short the second stage of labour. Another indication can be preeclampsia, post caesarean pregnancy.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Maximum traction in primi is 20 kgs and in multi is 13 kgs, applied along occipitomental diameter.</p>\n<p></p>",
