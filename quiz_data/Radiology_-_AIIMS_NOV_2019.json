Hydatid cyst ; Hydatid disease, or cystic echinococcosis, is a parasitic infection caused by a tapeworm. It can cause cysts to grow in your liver and other organs. Option B. Lung Abscess ; Lung abscess is defined as necrosis of the pulmonary tissue and formation of cavities containing necrotic debris or fluid caused by microbial infection. The formation of multiple small (< 2 cm) abscesses is occasionally referred to as necrotizing pneumonia or lung gangrene Option D. Thoracic Duct Malformations ;The thoracic duct passes through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm into the posterior mediastinum continuing cephalad between the aorta and azygos vein until approximately the level of the fifth thoracic vertebra where it passes behind the esophagus.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>A lung consolidation can also be fluid, but it is present inside the lungs, unlike pleural effusion, which is present in the space outside the lungs. Hence, lung consolidation cannot move when the position is changed. This criterion is used to differentiate pleural effusion and lung consolidation.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

While scoliosis can occur in people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, the cause of most childhood scoliosis is not known</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B. Neurofibromatosis ; NF1 is caused by mutations in the gene that controls production of a protein called neurofibromin (neurofibromin 1). This gene is believed to function as a tumor suppressor. In about 50% of people with NF1, the disorder results from gene mutations that occur for unknown reasons (spontaneous mutation) Option C. Degenerative arthritic ; Osteoarthritis is sometimes referred to as degenerative arthritis or degenerative joint disease. It is the most common type of arthritis because it's often caused by the wear and tear on a joint over a lifetime. It is most often found in the hands, knees, hips and spine.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Scoliosis Signs and Symptoms Curved posture. Difficulty sitting or standing.

Stratosphere Sign ;  If lung sliding is absent, it will appear on the M-mode images as uniform horizontal straight lines known as the stratosphere sign or the barcode sign where the grainy/sandy appearance is not seen due to the absence of motion. The stratosphere sign suggests pneumothorax as a probable cause Option C. Troposphere Sign Option D.
