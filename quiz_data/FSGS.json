Option: C. \u03b1-actinin: It is an actin-binding protein that is found in many cell types, including podocytes. Mutations in the ACTN4 gene, which encodes \u03b1-actinin-4, have been linked to a rare form of familial FSGS that is resistant to steroid treatment. Option: D. CD2AP: CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) is a scaffolding protein that is involved in the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier.
