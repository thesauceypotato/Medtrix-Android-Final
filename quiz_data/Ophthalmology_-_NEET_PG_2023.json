Clinical features of congenital glaucoma Lacrimation, photophobia, and blepharospasm often form the classic triad of symptoms of congenital glaucoma. Corneal signs . Corneal signs include oedema, enlargement, and Descemet\u2019s breaks . Corneal oedema. It is the first sign. Corneal enlargement . It occurs along with the enlargement of globe-buphthalmos it usually seen in children less than 3 years of age. Normal infant cornea measures 10.5 mm. A diameter of more than 13 mm confirms enlargement. Tears and breaks in Descemet\u2019s membrane (Haab\u2019s striae) The sclera becomes thin and appears blue due to underlying uveal tissue. The anterior chamber becomes deep . Iris may show iridodonesis and atrophic patches in the late stage. The lens becomes flat due to stretching of zonules and may even subluxate backward.

Loss/damage to the epithelium is termed an epithelial defect. It can be demonstrated clearly by staining with 1 percent sodium fluorescein dye and viewed with cobalt blue filter light. If superficial without any inflammation, an epithelial defect is also called an abrasion or erosion and usually heals within 12-24 hours by regeneration of the epithelial cells from the periphery, which slide over to cover the defect. Inflammation in the cornea is visible as a greyish haze or loss of clarity. If accompanied by an outpouring of leucocytes, the appearance is more off-white or yellowish, and this hazy area is termed as an infiltration.

The deepest (basal) layer is made up of columnar cells, the next 2-3 layers of wing or umbrella cells, and the most superficial two layers are made of flattened cells . Bowman's membrane . This layer consists of an acellular mass of condensed collagen fibrils Stroma (substantia propria). This layer is about 0.5 mm in thickness and constitutes most of the cornea (90% of the total thickness). It consists of collagen fibrils (type-I and type-V fibrillae intertwined with filaments of type-VI collagen) embedded in a hydrated matrix of proteoglycans (chondroitin sulphate and keratan sulphate) Pre- Descemet's membrane, also known as Dua's layer , was discovered in 2013 by Dr. Harminder Dua, an Indian ophthalmologist working in Great Britain. Located anterior to the Descemec's membrane, it is about 15 micrometer thick acellular structure that is very strong and impervious to air. Descemet's membrane (posterior elastic lamina) . The Descemet's membrane is a strong homogenous basement membrane of the corneal endothelium, which is separated from the stroma by the pre-Descemet's membrane. Endothelium . It consists of a single layer of flat polygonal (mainly hexagonal) epithelial cells (misnamed as the endothelium) which on slit-lamp biomicroscopy, appear as a mosaic.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Immature Senile Cataract, phacoemulsification with IOL This is a classic case presentation of Immature senile cataracts. A patient with senile cataract often presents with a history of gradual progressive deterioration and disturbance in vision. Decreased visual acuity is the most common complaint of patients with senile cataracts. Increased glare is another common complaint of patients with senile cataracts. This complaint may include an entire spectrum from a decrease in contrast sensitivity in brightly lit environments or disabling glare during the day to debilitating glare with oncoming headlights at night. At times, the nuclear changes are concentrated in the inner layers of the lens , resulting in a refractile area in the center of the lens, which often is seen best within the red reflex by retinoscopy or direct ophthalmoscopy. Such a phenomenon, which some call \u201clens within a lens phenomenon,\u201d may lead to monocular diplopia that is not correctable with spectacles, prisms, or contact lenses.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The progression of cataracts may frequently increase the dioptric power of the lens resulting in a mild-to-moderate degree of myopia or myopic shift. Consequently, presbyopic patients report an increase in their near vision and less need for reading glasses as they experience the so-called second sight. However, such occurrence is temporary, and, as the optical quality of the lens deteriorates, the second sight is eventually lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B : Lamellar Cataract -Also called as Zonular Cataract. Option C : Rosette cataract - Blunt Trauma Option D : Sunflower cataract - Wilson's disease</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Typically, myopic shift and second sight are not seen in cortical and posterior subcapsular cataracts. A cortical cataract generally is not clinically relevant until late in its progression when cortical spokes compromise the visual axis. The visual significance of oil droplet nuclear cataracts and small posterior subcapsular cataracts is evaluated best with a normal-sized pupil to determine if the visual axis is obscured.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
