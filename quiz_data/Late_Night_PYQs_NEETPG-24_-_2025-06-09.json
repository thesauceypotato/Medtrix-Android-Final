This combination is used during the initial induction phase of treatment.</li><li>\u2022 Liposomal amphotericin B is a polyene antifungal that binds to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, creating pores that lead to cell death.</li><li>\u2022 5-flucytosine is an antimetabolite that inhibits DNA and protein synthesis in fungal cells. The combination therapy provides synergistic effects against Cryptococcus, especially in the central nervous system infections like meningitis.</li><li>\u2022 Treatment of cryptococcal meningitis typically follows a three-phase approach:</li><li>\u2022 Treatment of cryptococcal meningitis typically follows a three-phase approach:</li><li>\u2022 Induction phase - liposomal amphotericin B plus 5-flucytosine Consolidation phase - fluconazole Maintenance phase- fluconazole</li><li>\u2022 Induction phase - liposomal amphotericin B plus 5-flucytosine</li><li>\u2022 Induction phase -</li><li>\u2022 Consolidation phase - fluconazole</li><li>\u2022 Consolidation phase -</li><li>\u2022 Maintenance phase- fluconazole</li><li>\u2022 Maintenance phase-</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Fluconazole: Fluconazole is used in the maintenance & Consolidation phase of cryptococcal meningitis treatment, not as the primary drug of choice for acute infection.

Fluconazole:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. 5-Flucytosine: While 5-flucytosine is an important component of the treatment regimen for cryptococcal meningitis, it is not used as monotherapy. It has limited efficacy when used alone and is primarily used in combination with amphotericin B to enhance fungicidal activity.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. 5-Flucytosine:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Terbinafine: Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal that inhibits squalene epoxidase, interfering with ergosterol synthesis.
