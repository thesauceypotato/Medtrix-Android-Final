B) Rucaparib</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Rucaparib is a PARP (Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase) inhibitor. PARP inhibitors work by blocking DNA repair mechanisms in cancer cells. In patients with BRCA mutations (who already have impaired DNA repair), PARP inhibition leads to synthetic lethality and cell death. The name helps identify PARP inhibitors as they end in \"parib\" (from Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase inhibitor).</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Palbociclib: Incorrect. This is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor used in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. While it might be useful in this patient's case, it is not a PARP inhibitor.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Palbociclib:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Vorinostat : Incorrect. This is a histone deacetylase inhibitor used in certain hematologic malignancies, not a PARP inhibitor.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Vorinostat</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Ustekinumab : Incorrect. This is a monoclonal antibody against interleukins used in psoriasis and other autoimmune conditions, not a PARP inhibitor.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Ustekinumab</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 PARP inhibitors (drugs ending in \"parib\") are particularly effective in cancers with BRCA mutations due to their mechanism of synthetic lethality in cells with impaired DNA repair.</li><li>\u27a4 Breast Cancer</li><li>\u27a4 Breast Cancer</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

D) It has a short duration of action due to rapid renal excretion</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Thiopentone's short duration of action is due to redistribution, not rapid renal excretion. Due to its high lipid solubility, it rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters the brain, causing quick onset of anesthesia. However, it then redistributes to other tissues (muscle and fat), leading to a rapid decrease in brain concentration and therefore a short duration of action. The drug remains in the body but is no longer in sufficient concentration in the brain to maintain anesthetic effects.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
