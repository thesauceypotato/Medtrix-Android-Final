      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Medulla In the given scenario, the college student has contracted meningitis, which is causing a centrally mediated increase in his respiratory rate. This means that the increase in respiratory rate is being controlled by the respiratory control center in the brain, which is located in the medulla. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Medulla.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The basic respiratory rhythm is generated in the medulla of the brain. The medulla contains several groups of neurons that form the respiratory control center, which includes the dorsal respiratory group (DRG) and the ventral respiratory group (VRG). These groups of neurons work together to control the rate and depth of breathing. The medulla has the respiratory rhythmic center. The pons have collections of neurons known as the pneumotaxic center and apneustic center.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- The basic respiratory rhythm is initiated by a small group of synaptically coupled pacemaker cells in the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex on either side of the medulla between the nucleus ambiguus and the lateral reticular nucleus. This basic rhythm can be modified by many factors, including higher centers in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus and input from the reticular activating system and pontine respiratory centers, including the pneumotaxic center in the nucleus para-brachialis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>RESPIRATORY CONTROL SYSTEM OF THE BRAIN Respiration is controlled by two separate neural mechanisms. One voluntary and one involuntary. Nerves from the cerebral cortex communicate with the motor neurons that directly innervate the diaphragm and the other respiratory muscles. This is responsible for the voluntary component. Other areas of the brain-classically referred to as the respiratory centers located in the medulla and pons are responsible for the involuntary or automatic component. They, too, communicate with the motor neurons supplying the respiratory muscles. This center has two groups of neurons. One group is situated dorsally\u2014the dorsal respiratory group\u2014 and contains neurons that control the motor neurons that supply the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles. Another group of neurons in the medulla, situated ventrally, the ventral respiratory group, is active during forced respiration.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dysfunctional central chemoreceptors The most likely cause of the infant's apnea in this scenario is dysfunctional central chemoreceptors. The central chemoreceptors are responsible for detecting changes in PaCO2 levels and are essential for regulating ventilation. In this case, the infant's ventilation did not increase when PaCO2 was increased, indicating that the central chemoreceptors were not responding appropriately.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The central chemoreceptors respond to changes in [H+] in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which are brought about by changes in arterial PCO2. The failure of CO2 to increase ventilation indicates that the central chemoreceptors are not functioning properly. The peripheral chemoreceptors are stimulated by hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidemia, and thus are functioning appropriately because ventilation decreased when PO2 was increased (hyperoxia).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A . Bronchospasm: Obstructive sleep apnea is caused by upper airway obstruction due to hypotonic pharyngeal or genioglossus muscles or too much fat around the pharynx, but not because of obstruction of the tracheobronchial tree by bronchospasm. Option B. Diaphragmatic fatigue: Diaphragmatic fatigue can cause hypoventilation, but is not associated with apneic episodes, perhaps because of the increased contribution of the accessory muscles of respiration. Option C. Decreased irritant receptor sensitivity: The reflex effect of stimulation of the irritant receptors by mechanical or chemical irritation of the airways is bronchoconstriction and cough.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Receptors: Aortic arch\ntransmits via vagus nerve to solitary nucleus of medulla (responds to changes\nin BP).

When CO2 levels increase, carbonic anhydrase in the brain catalyzes the formation of H+ ions, which in turn stimulate the central chemoreceptors. Therefore, option A, an increase in CO2 tension, is the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The central chemoreceptors are located in the medulla oblongata, near the respiratory centers. They are highly sensitive to changes in CO2 levels in the CSF, but they also respond to changes in blood pH levels , which are influenced by CO2 levels in the blood.

CO2 readily penetrates membranes, including the blood-brain barrier, whereas H+ and HCO3\u2013penetrate slowly.</p>\n<p></p>",
