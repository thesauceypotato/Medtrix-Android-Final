It is highly elevated in biliary obstruction and alcoholism. Serum \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is the sensitive indicator of alcohol use. For chronic viral hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver, AST: ALT ratio less than 1 For alcoholic liver disease, AST: ALT ratio >2:1 Lactate dehydrogenase isozyme-5 (LDH-5) is also a major diagnostic test for liver diseases</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Phosphocreatine We do not store a significant amount of ATP and need a continuous supply; it must be constantly resynthesized. This occurs in several ways using one of the three energy systems: \u2013    Phosphagen (immediate source) \u2013    Anaerobic (somewhat slow, uses carbohydrates) \u2013    Aerobic (slow, uses either carbohydrate or fat) Phosphagen This system uses creatine phosphate (CP) and has a very rapid rate of ATP production. The creatine phosphate is used to reconstitute ATP after it is broken down to release its energy. The total amount of CP and ATP stored in muscles is small, so there is limited energy available for muscular contraction. It is, however, instantaneously available and is essential at the onset of activity, as well as during short-term high-intensity activities lasting about 1\u201330 seconds in duration, such as sprinting, weight-lifting, or throwing a ball. Aerobic glycolysis has a slow rate of ATP production and is predominantly utilized during longer-duration, lower-intensity activities after the phosphagen and anaerobic systems have fatigued.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Increased conversion of fatty acid to acetyl CoA Increased conversion of fatty acid to acetyl CoA > D. Decreased in cholesterol synthesis In type I DM, insulin is decreased or not produced. So lipolysis increases, leading to increased beta oxidation, increased production of acetyl CoA, and hence increased ketogenesis. Ketoacidosis is the most prominent feature of type 1 DM. Studies have revealed that in such cases cholesterol synthesis will be decreased. Decreased insulin levels cause fatty acid synthesis to decrease and glucagon levels to increase. As decreased insulin levels cause decreased acetyl CoA carboxylase activity, hence decreased production of malonyl CoA, an allosteric inhibitor of CPT-I the RLE of beta oxidation. So uninhibited beta oxidation, i.e., fatty acid conversion to acetyl CoA. Adipose triacylglycerol\u2019s are degraded and fatty acids are released. They are converted to ketone bodies in the liver and ketoacidosis can occur. Non enzymatic decarboxylation of acetoacetate forms acetone, which causes the odor associated with diabetic ketoacidosis.</p>\n<p></p>",
