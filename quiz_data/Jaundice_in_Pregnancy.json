      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>2 and 4 The given clinical case scenario is that of Hepatitis B infection in pregnancy. Management of HBV during pregnancy: HBV infection can be prevented by vaccination, and the recombinant vaccine is safe in pregnancy. A seronegative pregnant woman should have HB immunoglobulin (HBIG), 0.06 mL/kg IM, soon after exposure and a second dose after one month. Then she should be given recombinant DNA vaccine intramuscularly 1 mL, three doses at 0, 1, and 6 months. All infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should have HBIG 0.5 mL IM within 12 hours of birth. (STATEMENT 2) Active immunization with HB vaccine (0.5 mL) is also given IM at a separate site at the same schedule . This is very effective (85\u201395 percent) in protecting the infant from HBV infection. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated.(STATEMENT 1)</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV): The virus is transmitted by parenteral route, sexual contact, vertical transmission and also through breast milk. The risk of transmission to fetus ranges from 10% in first trimester to as high as 90% in third trimester and it is specially high (90%) from those mothers who are seropositive to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 'e'-antigen (HBeAg). Neonatal transmission mainly occurs at or around the time of birth through mixing of maternal blood and genital secretions. Approximately 25% of the carrier neonate will die from between late childhood to early adulthood. hosis or hepatic carcinoma, HBV is not teratogenic Maternal infection : The acute infection is manifested by flu like illness as malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. In majority, it remains asymptomatic. Jaundice is rare and fever is uncommon. Clinical course (HBV) : Nearly 90-95% of patients clear the infection and have full recovery. 1% develop fulminant hepatitis resulting massive hepatic necrosis. 10-15% become chronic and 10% of these chronic cases suffer from chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Diagnosis is confirmed by serological detection of HBsAg, HBeAg (denote high infectivity) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and HBV DNA titer (107-10\u00b9\u00b9). Screening: All pregnant women should be screened for HBV infection at first antenatal visit and it should be repeated during the third trimester for 'high risk' groups (intravenous drug abusers, sexual promiscuity, hemophilics, patients on hemodialysis or having multiple sex partners).</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Similar to HIV, perinatal transmission of HBV depends on maternal viral load. Lamivudine and HBIG effectively reduce the transplacental transmission of HBV to the fetus. Lamivudine is given at 150 mg/day for 34 weeks.</p>\n<p></p>",

Although few these days due to potent antiemetics and antihistaminics. It is limited to the first trimester and more in the first pregnancy and younger age group. It is due to increased HCG, which rises at six weeks, peaks at 9-10 weeks, and subside by 16 weeks. However, other hormones, like estrogen progesterone, thyroxine, prolactin, leptin, and adrenocortical hormones, are also implicated. A, D -both are the same, aka obstetric cholestasis, which presents more often in 3rd trimester and presents with generalized pruritis. Vomiting is not severe and has increased bile salts. It is not related to shock-like features. C-AFLP is the most common cause of acute liver failure in pregnancy. Presents in 3rd trimester and has features of acute liver failure like hypoglycemia, encephalopathy, and coagulopathy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>DEFINITION: It is a severe type of vomiting of pregnancy which has got deleterious effect on the health of mother and/or incapacitates her in day-to-day activities. The adverse effects of severe vomiting are-dehydration, metabolic acidosis (from starvation) or alkalosis (from loss of hydrochloric acid), electrolyte imbalance (hypokalemia) and weight loss.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>HBIG 0.5ml IM within 12 hours of birth and hep B vaccine IM simultaneously. All infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should have HBIG 0.5ml IM within 12 hours of birth and hep B vaccine IM simultaneously at a separate site. This is very effective to protect infant from HBV infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV): The virus is transmitted by parenteral route, sexual contact, vertical transmission and also through breast milk. The risk of transmission to fetus ranges from 10% in first trimester to as high as 90% in third trimester and it is specially high (90%) from those mothers who are seropositive to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 'e'-antigen (HBeAg). Neonatal transmission mainly occurs at or around the time of birth through mixing of maternal blood and genital secretions. Approximately 25% of the carrier neonate will die from cirrhosis or hepatic carcinoma, between late childhood to early adulthood HBV is not teratogenic. Maternal infection : The acute infection is manifested by flu like illness as malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. In majority, it remains asymptomatic. Jaundice is rare and fever is uncommon. Clinical course (HBV): Nearly 90-95% of patients clear the infection and have full recovery. 1% develop fulminant hepatitis resulting massive hepatic necrosis. 10-15% become chronic and 10% of these chronic cases suffer from chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Diagnosis is confirmed by serological detection of HBsAg, HBeAg (denote high infectivity) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and HBV DNA titer (107-10\u00b9\u00b9). Screening: All pregnant women should be screened for HBV infection at first antenatal visit and it should be repeated during the third trimester for 'high risk' groups (intravenous drug abusers, sexual promiscuity, hemophilics, patients on hemodialysis or having multiple sex partners).</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Similar to HIV, perinatal transmission of HBV depends on maternal viral load. Lamivudine and HBIG effectively reduce the transplacental transmission of HBV to the fetus. Lamivudine is given at 150 mg/day for 34 weeks.</p>\n<p></p>",
