B)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Glycogen synthase is a key enzyme involved in glycogenesis, the process of synthesizing glycogen, which serves as a storage form of glucose in the liver and muscles. Glycogen synthase catalyzes the addition of glucose molecules to the growing glycogen chain by creating alpha-1,4-glycosidic linkages between glucose units. This enzyme is regulated by various factors, including insulin, which promotes glycogen synthesis by activating glycogen synthase.</li><li>\u27a4 Mutations or dysregulation of glycogen synthase can lead to Glycogen Storage Disease 0 (GSD 0), a disorder resulting from mutations in the GYS2 gene encoding liver glycogen synthase. C/f include fasting hypoglycemia, hunger between meals, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), and other metabolic abnormalities due to impaired glycogen synthesis.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
