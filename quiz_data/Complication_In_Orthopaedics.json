Common sites: Some of the sites where avascular necrosis commonly occurs are given in Table-7.5. Consequences: Avascular necrosis causes deformation of the bone. This leads to secondary Table-7.5: Common sites of avascular necrosis Site                                   Cause Head of the femur             Fracture neck of the femur.

Diagnosis: Avascular necrosis should always be suspected in fracture where it is known to occur. Pain and stiffness appear rather late. Radiological changes as given below appear earlier (Fig-7.4). Sclerosis of necrotic area: The avascular bone is unable to share disuse osteoporosis as occurs in the surrounding normal bones. Hence, it stands out densely on the X-ray. Deformity of the bone occurs because of the collapse of necrotic bone. It is possible to diagnose avascular necrosis on bone scan before changes appear on plain X-rays. It is visible as 'cold area' on the bone scan. Osteoarthritis supervenes giving rise to diminished joint space, osteophytes (lipping of bone from margins) etc. Treatment: Avascular necrosis may be prevented by early, energetic reduction of susceptible fractures and dislocations. Once it has occurred, the following treatment options remain: Delay weight bearing on the necrotic bone until it is revascularised, thereby preventing its collapse. It takes anywhere from 6-8 months for the bone to revascularise. Revascularisation procedure by using vascularised bone grafts (e.g. vascularised bone pedicle graft from greater trochanter in an avascular femoral head in fracture of the neck of the femur). Excision of the avascular segment of bone where doing so does not hamper functions e.g. fracture of the scaphoid. Excision followed by replacement e.g., in fracture of the neck of the femur, the avascular head can be replaced by a prosthesis. Total joint replacement or arthrodesis may be required once the patient is disabled because of pain from osteoarthritis secondary to avascular necrosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>MRI The X-ray shows flattening of the femoral head and degenerative changes associated with the Avascular necrosis of the femoral head. The most sensitive and specific investigation for avascular necrosis is MRI. MRI allows accurate assessment of the extent of involvement and can also identify associated bone marrow changes. X-ray may be normal in the early stages of the disease. Avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis of the femoral head occurs because of an interruption in the blood supply to the femoral head which causes bone death. This leads to the collapse of the femoral head causing secondary osteoarthritis subsequently. MRI - The most sensitive and specific investigation for avascular necrosis is MRI</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>AVASCULAR NECROSIS Blood supply of some bones is such that the vascularity of a part of it is seriously jeopardized following fracture, resulting in necrosis of that part. Common sites: Some of the sites where avascular necrosis commonly occurs are given in Table-7.5. Consequences: Avascular necrosis causes deformation of the bone. This leads to secondary Common sites of avascular necrosis Site                                   Cause Head of the femur             Fracture neck of the femur. Posterior dislocation of the hip Proximal pole of scaphoid                           Fracture through the waist of the scaphoid osteoarthritis a few years later, thus causing painful limitation of joint movement. Body of the talus               Fracture through neck of the talus Diagnosis: Avascular necrosis should always be suspected in fracture where it is known to occur. Pain and stiffness appear rather late. Radiological changes as given below appear earlier (Fig-7.4). Sclerosis of necrotic area: The avascular bone is unable to share disuse osteoporosis as occurs in the surrounding normal bones. Hence, it stands out densely on the X-ray. Deformity of the bone occurs because of the collapse of necrotic bone. Osteoarthritis supervenes giving rise to diminished joint space, osteophytes (lipping of bone from margins) etc. It is possible to diagnose avascular necrosis on bone scan before changes appear on plain X-rays. It is visible as 'cold area' on the bone scan. Treatment: Avascular necrosis may be prevented by early, energetic reduction of susceptible fractures and dislocations. Once it has occurred, the following treatment options remain: Delay weight bearing on the necrotic bone until it is revascularised, thereby preventing its collapse. It takes anywhere from 6-8 months for the bone to revascularise. Revascularisation procedure by using vascularised bone grafts (e.g. vascularised bone pedicle graft from greater trochanter in an avascular femoral head in fracture of the neck of the femur). Excision of the avascular segment of bone where doing so does not hamper functions e.g. fracture of the scaphoid. Excision followed by replacement e.g., in fracture of the neck of the femur, the avascular head can be replaced by a prosthesis. Total joint replacement or arthrodesis may be required once the patient is disabled because of pain from osteoarthritis secondary to avascular necrosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Immobilization Treatment of myositis ossificans (MO): when MO is active, immobilization is the best treatment & any attempt at removal of the mass is hazardous. When silent and ALP/ESR levels are normal, it can safely be removed (generally after 1.5 years) if causing a block in movements. Indomethacin / low-dose radiation/bisphosphonates can be given prophylactically in high-risk patients to prevent MO formation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>MYOSITIS OSSIFICANS (POST-TRAUMATIC OSSIFICATION) This is ossification of the haematoma around a joint, resulting in the formation of a mass of bone restricting joint movements, often completely. Causes: It occurs in cases with severe injury to a joint, especially when the capsule and the periosteum have been stripped from the bones by violent displacement of the fragments. It is common in children because in them the periosteum is loosely attached to the bones. It is particularly common around the elbow joint. There is also a relatively high incidence in patients with prolonged or permanent neuronal damage from head injury, and in patient with paraplegia. Massage following trauma is a factor known to aggravate myositis. Consequences: The bone formation leads to stiffness of the joint, either due to thickening of the capsule or due to the bone blocking movement. In extreme cases, the bone bridges the joint resulting in complete loss of movements (extra-articular ankylosis). Radiologically, an active myositis and a mature myositis have been identified. In the former, the margins of the bone mass are fluffy (Fig-7.5); in the latter the bone appears trabeculated with well- defined margins. Treatment: Massage following injury is strictly prohibited. In the early active stage of myositis the limb should be rested, and NSAID is given. In late stages, it is possible to regain movement by physiotherapy. In some cases, once the myositic mass matures, surgical excision of the bone mass may help regain movement.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
