      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. C) Galactokinase</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The 3-month-old girl presents with cataracts and a positive test for reducing sugars in the urine, but negative for glucose. These findings suggest a metabolic disorder involving galactose. The deficiency of galactokinase, an enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of galactose to galactose-1-phosphate, leads to the accumulation of galactose in the blood (galactosemia) and urine (galactosuria).</li><li>\u2022 In the lens of the eye, accumulated galactose is converted to galactitol, a sugar alcohol, by the enzyme aldose reductase. Galactitol causes osmotic changes in the lens, leading to water retention and cataract formation. The absence of other systemic findings such as liver damage or neurologic effects, which are associated with other disorders of galactose metabolism, points to an isolated galactokinase deficiency.</li><li>\u2022 Thus, the girl's clinical and biochemical presentation is most consistent with galactokinase deficiency.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Aldolase B: Aldolase B is involved in the metabolism of fructose. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to hereditary fructose intolerance, a severe disorder characterized by hypoglycemia, vomiting, failure to thrive, and liver and kidney damage upon fructose ingestion. Cataracts are not typically seen in this condition. Since the presentation in this case is related to galactose metabolism rather than fructose metabolism, aldolase B deficiency is not the correct answer.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Aldolase B:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Fructokinase: Fructokinase deficiency causes essential fructosuria, a benign condition in which fructose is excreted in the urine due to the inability to phosphorylate fructose to fructose-1-phosphate. This condition does not cause systemic effects, cataracts, or urine findings as described in this case. Thus, fructokinase deficiency is not relevant to the girl's clinical presentation.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Fructokinase:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Galactose 1-phosphate uridylyl transferase (GALT): Deficiency of GALT results in classic galactosemia, a severe condition characterized by cataracts, hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction, and neurologic effects such as developmental delay and seizures. The absence of systemic effects such as liver damage or neurologic symptoms in this child makes GALT deficiency less likely. Additionally, classic galactosemia typically presents earlier in infancy with more severe systemic involvement.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
