L5</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The green line marked on the torso corresponds to the L5 vertebral level. This line is also known as the intertubercular plane or Tuffier's line, which is anatomically aligned with the upper border of the L5 vertebra. The intertubercular plane is significant in clinical settings as it passes through the highest points of the iliac crests, located at the L4-L5 intervertebral disc space. This reference point is crucial for procedures such as spinal anesthesia and lumbar punctures, where accurate identification of vertebral levels is essential.</li><li>\u2022 Clinical Significance:</li><li>\u2022 Clinical Significance:</li><li>\u2022 It serves as a reference point for various medical procedures, particularly those involving the lumbar spine, spinal anesthesia, and the placement of lumbar punctures (spinal taps). When performing a lumbar puncture, healthcare providers often use the intertubercular plane as a landmark to identify the appropriate level for inserting the needle into the subarachnoid space. Tuffier's Line: The term \"Tuffier's line\" is often used interchangeably with the intertubercular plane. Dr. Paul Tuffier, a French surgeon, introduced this reference point in the early 20th century. Variations: It's important to note that individual anatomical variations exist, and the level of the iliac crests can vary among individuals. Therefore, healthcare providers may use additional methods, such as palpation of bony landmarks or radiological guidance, to accurately identify the L4-L5 intervertebral space.</li><li>\u2022 It serves as a reference point for various medical procedures, particularly those involving the lumbar spine, spinal anesthesia, and the placement of lumbar punctures (spinal taps).</li><li>\u2022 When performing a lumbar puncture, healthcare providers often use the intertubercular plane as a landmark to identify the appropriate level for inserting the needle into the subarachnoid space.
