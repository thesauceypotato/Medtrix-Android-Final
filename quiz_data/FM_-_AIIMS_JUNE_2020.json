In some cases ,in spite of good medical attention and care, an individual fails to respond properly or may suffer from adverse reactions to the drug. This is called medical mal occurrence. The injured person cannot get monetary compensation in every mishap or accident which results in injury. if the doctor was careful in the selection of the drug and has taken appropriate measures to overcome the undesirable foreseeable effects. Accident can be defined as an unpredictable event resulting in a recognisable injury. Inevitable accident is an accident not avoidable by any such precautions as a reasonable man can be expected to take. Examples of Medical Maloccurrence - Breaking of a needle during intramuscular injection due to sudden muscular spasm Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve during thyroidectomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Novus actus Interveniens:- It means an unrelated action intervening At times, it occurred that patients might suffer damage or harm due to new action , which intervene or intercede the For example \u2013 suppose an operated patient is shifted to a recovery room and suddenly, due to an earthquake , the ceiling falls over the patient and the patient dies in the accident. Here the falling of the ceiling is a new intervention that has occurred. A doctor may not be held responsible if damage occurred to a patient due to new action, which intervenes in the treatment. Option C. Physician error- It is a preventable adverse effect of care (\"iatrogenesis\"), whether or not it is evident or harmful to the patient. This might include an inaccurate or incomplete diagnosis or treatment of a disease, injury, syndrome, behavior, infection, or other ailment.- Option D. Res ipsa loquitur- In doctrine of Res ipsa loquitur , the facts of the case are sufficient to justify the conclusion that doctor was negligent and negligence of doctor is responsible for the harm suffered by the patient.Examples of Res ipsa loquitur are as follows: Amputation of wrong digit or limb Leaving a swab or instrument in the abdomen of the patient after operation. Giving medicine carelessly or prescribing overdose of medicines produces ill effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>S. 304, A., I.P.C. deals with criminal negligence. \"Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide shall be punished with imprisonment up to 2 years , or with fine , or with both\".</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Defenses against negligence for doctor- No duty owed to the patient Duty discharged as per prevailing / accepted standards Contributory Negligence (only for civil cases) Patient Negligence Medical Maloccurrence Therapeutic Misadventure Diagnostic Misadventure Experimental Misadventure Novus Actus Interveniens Res Judicata 11 .
