If there are multiple sites or widespread infection (For Example- Interloop abscesses between loops of the small intestine), surgical drainage is necessary and can be performed either by laparoscopic or open approach.

A deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon and is culture-positive or not cultured when the patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38\u00b0C) or localized pain or tenderness.

Issues with Hair : Hair removal may be necessary to facilitate adequate exposure to the site and preoperative skin marking. Suturing and the application of wound dressings can be complicated by the presence of hair. Apart from these practical issues, hair has been associated with a lack of cleanliness and the potential to cause surgical site infection (SSI). However, there is also the belief that hair removal inversely increases the risk of SSI by causing microscopic trauma to the skin. Shaving results in epidermal micro-trauma and bacterial colonization which is associated with a higher risk of wound infection. Hair Removal Techniques : Razors Clippers cut the hair close to the skin without actually touching it, whereas razors involve a sharp blade drawn directly over the skin. A third method for hair removal is the application of depilatory creams containing chemicals. The drawbacks are the necessity to leave the cream in place for approximately 15-20 minutes for the hair to be dissolved and the potential for allergic reactions. According to World Health Organization, guidelines hair should not be removed unless it interferes with the surgical procedure. If hair removal is required, the evidence supports the use of clippers, which cut the hair close to the patient\u2019s skin, for all sites. The use of razors (shaving) before surgery has been shown to increase the incidence of SSI when compared to clipping, depilatory use, or no hair removal at all. Clipping: Clipping rather than shaving when hair removal is necessary improves the safety and quality of care that patients receive. Thus, clipping not shaving guidelines recommend that hair removal using electric clippers should occur as close to the time of the surgical procedure as possible. Ideally, this should be done outside the operating room to minimize the dispersal of loose hair and the potential for contamination of the sterile field or surgical wound.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A: Length of patient stay should be kept to a minimum standardized to prevent SSI Option: B: Antiseptic skin preparation should be standardized to prevent SSI Option: C: Staff should always wash their hands between patients to prevent SSI</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Faulty closure technique</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Surgical wound dehiscence (SWD) is the separation of the margins of a closed surgical incision that has been made in the skin, with or without exposure or protrusion of underlying tissue, organs, or implants. Separation may occur at single or multiple regions, or involve the full length of the incision, and may affect some or all tissue layers. A dehisced incision may, or may not, display clinical signs and symptoms of infection. Causes of SWD : Technical issues with the closure of the incision \u2013 the unraveling of suture knots including faulty inadequate closure is the most important factor for wound dehiscence. Mechanical stress \u2013 coughing can cause breakage of the sutures or rupture of the healing incision after suture or clip removal/reabsorption Disrupted healing \u2013 due to comorbidities or treatments that hamper healing, or as a result of a surgical site infection (SSI) SWD may occur because of technical issues with the closure of the incision. Surgical incisions are closed to bring together the sides of the wound to facilitate healing and minimize scar formation. Surgical incision closure is achieved with sutures, staples, adhesive tapes, or topical tissue adhesives. The most appropriate closure material and technique for a surgical incision depends on a wide variety of factors including the number of tissue layers to be closed, the anatomical location of the incision, the condition of the patient, and surgeon experience/preference. SWD may occur if the method of incisional closure fails or is not strong enough to hold the edges and sides of the incision together. For example, SWD may occur if suture knots slip or unravel, or sutures break, stretch, or cut through tissue because they have been placed too close to the edge of the incision, too far apart, and/or put under too much tension.</p>\n<p></p>",
