Frequently, a chest radiograph reveals a military reticulonodular pattern (more easily seen on underpenetrated film), although no radiographic abnormality may be evident early in the course and among HIV-infected.

The clinical manifestations include Bacillary angiomatosis caused by henselae and associated with exposure to flea-bitten cats . It presents with skin lesions which can be confused with Kaposi sarcoma Cat scratch disease caused by henselae.
