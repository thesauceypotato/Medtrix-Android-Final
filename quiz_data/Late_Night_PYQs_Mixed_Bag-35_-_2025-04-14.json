B) Phagocytosis is enhanced</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Phagocytosis is enhanced: This statement is incorrect. NET formation does not directly enhance phagocytosis. Instead, it is a distinct mechanism where the neutrophil traps and kills pathogens extracellularly, without engulfing them through phagocytosis.</li><li>\u2022 Phagocytosis is enhanced:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a defense mechanism employed by neutrophils to trap and kill extracellular pathogens. During NET formation, neutrophils undergo a process called NETosis, which involves chromatin decondensation and the release of DNA along with antibacterial enzymes into the extracellular space. This forms a mesh-like structure that can trap and kill bacteria.</li><li>\u2022 Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Induced by sepsis: True. NETs are induced by various stimuli, including sepsis. In septicemia-like conditions, the presence of pathogens triggers the formation of NETs as a response to the infection.</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Induced by sepsis:</li><li>\u2022 Option C: Higher risk of SLE: True. NET formation also has some negative consequences. The exposure of nuclear antigens during NETosis can lead to an increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The nuclear antigens released during NET formation can be recognized as \"self\" by the immune system, leading to the production of autoantibodies and the development of SLE.</li><li>\u2022 Option C: Higher risk of SLE:</li><li>\u2022 Option D: Affected cell does not survive: True. In NET formation, the neutrophil undergoes a form of cell death called NETotic cell death. The affected neutrophil does not survive the process of NETosis, as it involves the release of its cellular contents, including DNA and enzymes. This process is sometimes referred to as \"beneficial suicide\" because the neutrophil sacrifices itself to create the extracellular trap that can capture and kill pathogens.</li><li>\u2022 Option D: Affected cell does not survive:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Neutrophil extracellular traps are induced by sepsis, increase the risk of developing SLE due to exposure of nuclear antigens, and result in the death of the affected neutrophil, but they do not enhance phagocytosis.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
