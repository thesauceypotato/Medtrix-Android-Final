The fetish may be only incidentally associated with the human body, g........ a flower. In some cases, a picture of the fetish object provides the sufficient stimulus. Sometimes, stealing the articles provides adequate sexual satisfaction, though often the fetish article is stored to the satisfaction of the fetish, or touching it gives him sex pleasure, or he may masturbate into the object. It is almost exclusively seen in males. It is harmless, but rarely it may drive the person to obtain his fetish object through violence, or other criminal act, e.g., things may be stolen, or women may be attacked either as part of robbery with violence or because the fetish provides the trigger for rape or indecent assault.</p>\n<p></p>",
