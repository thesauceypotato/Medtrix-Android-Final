It gives a more complete expression of protein quality than the amino acid score. It is a biological method & requires special laboratory facilities. The protein requirement varies with the NPU of dietary protein. If NPU is low, more protein is required & vice versa . The NPU of protein in the Indian diet varies between 50 \u2013 80. NPU = ( N 2 retained by body / N 2 intake) X 100</p>\n<p></p>",

During the process of hydrogenation, unsaturated fatty acids are converted into saturated acids, and the EFA content is drastically reduced. The main advantage of vanaspati is its ghee-like consistency and its keeping quality even in hot humid climates. Partial hydrogenation, the process used to increase the shelf-life of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) creates trans fatty acids and also removes the critical double bonds in essential fatty acids. Metabolic studies have demonstrated that trans-fatty acids render the plasma lipid profile even more atherogenic than saturated fatty acids, by not only elevating LDL cholesterol but also by decreasing HDL cholesterol.</p>\n<p></p>",

Studies have shown that amino acid imbalance caused by an excess of leucine is the main cause of pellagra in both jowar and maize eaters. Excess leucine interferes in the conversion of tryptophan to niacin and hence it\u2019s a deficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B . Thiamin (Vitamin B1) deficiency occurs due to the consumption of highly polished rice and causes beriberi and Wernick\u2019s encephalopathy. Beriberi may occur in 3 main forms in humans- dry (peripheral neuritis), wet (cardiac), and infantile beriberi. Wernick\u2019s encephalopathy is seen in alcoholics and is characterized by ophthalmoplegia, polyneuritis, ataxia, and mental deterioration. Option: C . Zinc is a trace element required by the body. Zinc deficiency has been reported to result in growth failure and sexual infantilism in adolescents and in loss of taste and delayed wound healing Option: D. Ergotism is a condition caused by ergot fungus (Claviceps purpurea). It is a field fungus and food grains such as bajra, rye, sorghum and wheat have a tendency to get infested during the flowering stages of ergot fungus. Consumption of ergot-infested grain leads to ergotism. Symptoms include nausea, repeated vomiting, giddiness, and drowsiness. In chronic cases, painful cramps in limbs and peripheral gangrene may occur.</p>\n<p></p>",

Being a water-soluble vitamin, further losses take place during the washing and cooking of rice. So, it is advised people avoid highly polished rice and consume parboiled and under-milled rice.

In fluorosis-endemic areas, it may be as high as 3 to 12 mg per liter. Fluorine is a double-edged sword because prolonged ingestion of fluorides through drinking water in excess of the daily requirement is associated with dental and skeletal fluorosis; and inadequate intake with dental caries.
