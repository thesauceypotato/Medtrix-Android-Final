Annual incidence of approximately 1/830, 000. M:F = 3:1; median age at presentation 30 - 40 years. Sites: Peripheral lymph nodes generally \u2013 cervical, axillary, inguinal. Mesenteric lymph nodes can be affected. Mediastinal involvement is rare. Clinical features Usually presents as localized disease; usually stage I / II (70 - 80%); 20% may present with advanced stage disease. Advanced stage disease treated as an aggressive B cell lymphoma. Presents with peripheral lymphadenopathy; rarely mediastinal or bone marrow involvement; often long history of localized disease \u00b7 M > F. Wide age range; may present in children. B symptoms are uncommon (5 - 10%). Late recurrences more common than in classic Hodgkin lymphoma. Diagnosis Biopsy of the involved lymph node with immunohistochemistry. LP cells in a background of small lymphocytes admixed with histiocytes. LP cells: CD45+, CD20+, PAX5+ OCT+, BCL6+, CD15-, CD30 variable (Mostly negative); Subset positive for IgD, mainly in young males. Background: small B cells and T cells positive for CD4, PD-1 and partial CD57. Prognostic factors Excellent prognosis; remission rate of 90 - 100% after primary therapy and overall 10 year survival rates > 90% in limited stage disease.</p>\n<p></p>",

Carcinoid syndrome:It is caused by neuroendocrine tumors, known as carcinoids, that produce and release hormones, including serotonin, into the bloodstream. This results in various symptoms such as flushing, diarrhea, wheezing, and other systemic manifestations. Option D. Vitamin B12 deficiency: It can occur due to various reasons, including impaired absorption. Parietal cells in the stomach produce the intrinsic factor, which is required for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the small intestine.

In vitamin B12 deficiency, there is an increased production of oxidants like homocysteine. This leads to relative glutathione depletion leading to the activation of the tyrosinase enzyme. This results in the increased synthesis of melanin leading to pigmentation particularly at knuckles and oral mucosa. Folic acid deficiency results in megaloblastic anemia associated with neurological symptoms. Fe deficiency results in hypochromic microcytic anemia with the hair, skin (pallor), and nail changes (koilonychia). Vitamin B6 deficiency also leads to anemia which is not responsive to the vitamin B12, folic acid, or iron supplementation as it is requires as a coenzyme for the ALA synthase enzyme of heme synthesis.</p>\n<p></p>",

Deposits of antibodies build up in glomerular basement membrane which helps filter wastes and extra fluids from the blood. Damage to basement membrane affects the kidney's ability to create urine normally, which in turn causes blood and protein to leak into the urine. The 2 forms of this disease are MPGN I and MPGN II. Most people with the disease have type I. MPGN II is much less common. It also tends to get worse faster than MPGN I. Causes of MPGN include: Autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, sarcoidosis). Cancer (Leukaemia, lymphoma). Infections (HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Endocarditis, Malaria).</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Frozen section It is quite difficult to visualize the lipids in histology because they are dissolved in the solvents used for the preparation of the tissues. This means that the lipids can disappear from the tissue during the preparation and especially when it comes to paraffin sections. It is for this reason that  Frozen sections are more commonly used for lipid visualization. However, not all lipids are eliminated by solvents. This is the case of lipids that bind to other molecules such as lipoproteins, lipofuscins and myelin. On the contrary, triglycerides are always removed by the solvents during the preparation of paraffin tissues. The cell membranes are composed of a large amount of lipoproteins, and although these are not dissolved by the solvents, it is very difficult to demonstrate them by conventional methods of lipid staining. IHC: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the most common application of immuno staining. It involves the process of selectively identifying antigens (proteins) in cells of a tissue section by exploiting the principle of antibodies binding specifically to antigens in biological tissues. Frozen section: Fat tissue A frozen section (cryo section) is a pathological laboratory technique used for rapid microscopic analysis / diagnosis of a specimen / disease Usually used with oncologic surgery Rapid diagnosis can guide intra-operative patient management</p>\n<p></p>",
