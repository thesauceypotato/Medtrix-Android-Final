      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Respiratory Papillomatosis The image shows multiple papillomas all over the larynx. So it is respiratory papillomatosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Juvenile Laryngeal Papilloma Juvenile laryngeal papilloma is children's most common benign tumor of the larynx. It is seen at 2 to 5 years of age. It is caused by human papillomavirus subtype 6 and 11, and 11 is more aggressive.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. Carcinoma larynx usually presents in males between 50 to 70 years of age\u2014risk factors include smoking, alcohol infection with HPV, and irradiation to the neck. Option C. Vocal nodules appear symmetrically on the free edge of the vocal cord, at the junction of the anterior one-third, with the posterior two-thirds, as this is the area of maximum cord vibration and is thus subject to maximum trauma. Option D. Vocal polyp is unilateral, arising from the same position as a vocal nodule. It is soft, smooth and often pedunculated. It may flop up and down the glottis during respiration or phonation. Hoarseness is a common symptom.</p>\n<p></p>",
