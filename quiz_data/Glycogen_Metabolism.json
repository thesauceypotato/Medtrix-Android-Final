      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Compact The compactness of glycogen allows storage in a smaller space as compared to equivalent glucose. Glycogen is stored in large cytosolic granules. The elementary particle of glycogen, the \u03b2-particle, is about 21 nm in diameter and consists of up to 55,000 glucose residues The other reason is that a high cellular concentration of glucose would cause the cell to take up water by osmosis and lyase. By converting glucose to glycogen, the osmotic activity of glucose is greatly reduced. For example, 400mM glucose stored as glycogen is only about 0.01 \u03bcM with a drastic reduction in osmolarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B: Can be reduced from multiple branches/ends There is only a single reducing end per glycogen with a free carbonyl group but there are multiple non-reducing ends (Option B is a false statement) Option C: Can be stored at multiple sites There are only 2 major sites for the storage of glycogen. These are the liver and muscle. Only liver glycogen can be used to maintain blood glucose whereas muscle glycogen can only be used to provide energy for muscle contraction (Option C is a false statement) Option D:  Can provide glucose as much as needed and when needed for 1 week Liver glycogen can provide glucose only for 12-18 hours of fasting, after that, the main source of blood glucose is gluconeogenesis (Option D is a false statement).</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>3 In any cell or tissue other than muscle, glycogen gives rise to glucose which is phosphorylated by hexokinase to glucose-6-phosphate using ATP and then undergoes further glycolysis. However, muscle lacks glucose-6-phosphatase so the end product of glycogenolysis is glucose-6-P instead of glucose. This glucose-6-phosphate formed in glycogen degradation in muscles can directly enter the glycolysis without the need for ATP-requiring hexokinase reaction (See fig below). Thus, one less ATP is required for the investment stage (for conversion of glucose to glucose 6-P) of glycolysis in muscles only. Hence, the net yield of ATP from glycolysis of 1 glucose molecule increases by 1. So, we can say that: If starting material is glucose, then Net ATP/Glu from glycolysis = 2 ATPs But if starting material is glucose-6-P, then net ATP/Glu from glycolysis = 3 ATPs</p>\n<p></p>",

Instead, glycogenolysis requires the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, which is the RLE of glycogenolysis.

But this is not the reason for muscle glucose staying in the muscle cells after glycogenolysis.
