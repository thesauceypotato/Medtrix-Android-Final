Follicular carcinoma typically presents as a solitary thyroid nodule with a strong tendency for hematogenous spread rather than lymphatic spread. While it commonly metastasizes to bones (particularly thoracic vertebrae and skull) via blood vessels, lymph node involvement is rare, except in the Hurthle cell variant which may show lymph node metastases.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid - Incorrect because papillary carcinoma has a high propensity for lymph node metastasis. It frequently spreads to Level VI (central compartment) lymph nodes, and lymph node involvement is often present even in early disease. In fact, enlarged cervical lymph nodes may be the presenting feature of papillary carcinoma in some cases.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid - Incorrect because medullary carcinoma frequently metastasizes to lymph nodes. Involvement of lymph nodes occurs in 50-60% of cases of medullary carcinoma. This tumor, which arises from parafollicular C cells, also commonly spreads hematogenously, with the liver being the most common site of distant metastasis.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid - Incorrect because anaplastic carcinoma is characterized by rapid growth, extensive local invasion, and early lymph node metastasis. Being the most aggressive thyroid malignancy, it shows infiltration of surrounding structures including lymph nodes early in its course, along with distant metastases typically to the lungs.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

The characteristic endoscopic finding in CMV esophagitis is the presence of large, linear or serpiginous (snake-like) ulcers, often located in the distal esophagus.
