Patients with delayed sleep phase disorder would have excessive daytime sleepiness if they forced themselves to wake up before the end of their sleep-wake cycle.

However, these changes would not be accompanied by symptoms such as daytime sleepiness and unusual tiredness in the evenings . Option: D.

Melatonin is an important hormone for sleep onset, and melatonin levels decrease with aging . In theory, melatonin should decrease sleep latency . Furthermore, this patient's sleep latency is within the standard deviation of normal (i.e. less than 30 minutes), and it is unclear how much benefit she would receive. Option: C. Diphenhydramine is potentially inappropriate for patients more than 65 years of age due to its anticholinergic effects that can precipitate delirium, constipation, dry mouth, and urinary retention. Option: D. Bilevel positive airway pressure is a non-invasive form of respiratory support for patients with obstructive sleep apnea . Although this patient has daytime sleepiness and night-time awakenings, she lacks other features of obstructive sleep apnea such as obesity, snoring, hypertension, morning headaches, or awakenings with choking.</p>\n<p></p>",
