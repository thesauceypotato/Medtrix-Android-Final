      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Foreign body in the esophagus The initial plain radiographic series is crucial in the diagnosis of an esophageal foreign body, because the location and characteristics of the esophageal foreign body direct treatment. The most common site of foreign body lodgement is the upper esophagus at the level of the thoracic inlet. On the frontal chest radiograph, an opaque foreign body is depicted at the midclavicular level.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>A coin in the esophagus is depicted in the coronal plane of a frontal image because of the inherent configuration of the esophagus. If the coin is in the sagittal plane of the frontal image, the foreign body most likely is in the trachea. The orientation is generally caused by the incomplete circumferential cartilaginous rings along the posterior aspect of the trachea that allow the coin to protrude posteriorly. If the presence of a nonradiopaque foreign body is suspected, contrast-enhanced esophagography is indicated. Positive findings on the esophagram include irregularity of the contrast medium column or esophageal mucosa, as well as deviation in the expected course of the esophagus. Underlying stricture formation, with or without proximal esophageal dilatation or diverticula formation caused by chronic esophageal perforation, also may be present.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B. Foreign body in the Trachea; Upon aspiration of a foreign body into the larynx or proximal trachea, there is always the potential for respiratory compromise or for further inhalation into the distal airways causing subacute symptoms including shortness of breath, wheezing, or coughing. Option C. Subcutaneous Foreign Body;Very small particles that remain under the skin often don't cause problems or need further treatment. But sometimes they can cause an infection. Option D, Radiological artefact; X-ray artifacts can present in a variety of ways including abnormal shadows noted on a radiograph or degraded image quality, and have been produced by artificial means from hardware failure, operator error and software (post-processing) artifacts. There are common and distinct artifacts for film, computed (CR) and digital radiography (DR).</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Three special types of foreign body ingestions with a higher risk of complications are button batteries (also called \u201cdisc\u201d or \u201ccoin\u201d batteries), multiple magnets, and sharp-pointed objects. If a button battery becomes impacted in the esophagus, an electrical current is created between the positive and negative poles. This current can cause thermal injury plus produces hydroxide ions with a rapid rise in the local pH resulting in a caustic alkaline injury. While a single, small, smooth magnet will usually pass without complications, multiple magnets create complications. Tissue may become trapped between the magnets leading to pressure ischemia, perforation, fistula formation, obstruction, or volvulus. Sharp-pointed objects stuck in the esophagus also have a higher risk of perforation and need urgent removal.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Putty kidney Presence of sterile pyuria in this patient is a classic feature of genitourinary TB, which later involves the spread of infection to kidneys in the form of Putty kidney, as shown in the radiograph. Sterile pyuria is a form of pyuria that occurs without a detected presence of bacteria. Genitourinary tuberculosis (GUTB) typically involves hematogenous spread of chronic latent pulmonary infection to the kidneys, epididymis, or fallopian tubes; prostate seeding has also been reported but is extremely rare. Other genitourinary organs are affected by local spread. In the kidneys, when multiple granuloma form at the site of metastatic foci, they are typically bilateral, cortical, and adjacent to the glomeruli, and they may remain inactive for decades. Although both kidneys are seeded, clinically significant disease, which is caused by capillary rupture and delivery of proliferating bacilli into the proximal tubules, usually develops in only one kidney. The medullary hypertonic environment impairs the phagocytic function. Growing granuloma may erode into the calyceal system, spreading the bacilli to the renal pelvis, ureters, bladder, and other genitourinary organs. Depending on the status of the patient's defense mechanisms, fibrosis and strictures may develop with chronic abscess formation. Extensive lesions can result in nonfunctioning kidneys.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Extensive parenchymal calcification in a non-functioning kidney forming its cast is called a 'putty kidney' or 'autonephrectomy' which is a characteristic of end-stage renal TB. Ureteral TB is an extension of the disease from the kidneys, generally to the ureterovesical junction, and develops in about one half of all patients with renal TB. It only rarely affects the middle third of the ureter.Ureteral TB often causes ureteral strictures and, sometimes, hydronephrosis . Occasionally, severe cases can cause stricture of virtually the entire ureter.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B. Nephrocalcinosis Option C. Calcified psoas abscess; Psoas abscess is a collection of pus located in the iliopsoas muscle compartment. It can occur either via contiguous or hematogenous spread from distant sites Option D. Staghorn calculi ; A staghorn calculus, a type of kidney stone with branches, happens in some cases because of repeated infections. The branches can block urine from leaving the kidney, causing kidney failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Bladder TB is secondary to renal TB and usually starts at the ureteral orifice. It initially manifests as superficial inflammation with bullous edema and granulation. Fibrosis of the ureteral orifice can lead to stricture formation with hydronephrosis or scarification (ie, golf-hole appearance) with vesicoureteral reflux . Severe cases involve the entire bladder wall, where deep layers of muscle are eventually replaced by fibrous tissue, thus producing a thick fibrous bladder.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hollow viscus perforation Given case scenario is indicative of hollow viscus perforation. Perforated hollow viscus is characterized by loss of gastrointestinal wall integrity with subsequent leakage of enteric contents. Direct trauma or tissue ischemia and necrosis lead to full-thickness disruption of the gastrointestinal wall and perforation. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient presenting with an acute abdomen. Often, patients describe initially localized, visceral pain that becomes diffuse, dramatic, and severe, and progresses to peritonitis. Alternatively, patients with advanced age, obesity, immunosuppression, or contained perforation may present with minimal findings.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The presence of extraluminal air in an acutely ill patient with abdominal pain is an ominous sign that usually indicates perforation of a hollow viscus. Common causes include gastroduodenal peptic ulcer disease, perforation of a gastrointestinal neoplasm, acute appendicitis with perforation, and acute colonic or (less often) small bowel diverticulitis, including Meckel\u2019s diverticulitis. Other considerations include iatrogenic perforations caused by foreign bodies, or spontaneous rupture of the distal esophagus (Boerhaave\u2019s syndrome), as well as ischemia leading to necrosis. Anatomic considerations depend on the underlying cause of the hollow viscus perforation. Patients with esophageal perforation typically present with pneumomediastinum, which may dissect into the neck, pleural space, or pericardial space, as well as the retroperitoneum and intraperitoneal cavity. Figure : Axial computed tomography image reveals foci of free intraperitoneal air (arrows) as well as significant retroperitoneal air, predominantly within the anterior pararenal space around the pancreas (arrowheads). At surgery, the patient was found to have perforated ulcers within both the first and third portion of the duodenum, accounting for the intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal air, respectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B. Liver abscess ; A liver abscess is defined as a pus-filled mass in the liver that can develop from injury to the liver or an intraabdominal infection disseminated from the portal circulation.[1] The majority of these abscesses are categorized into pyogenic or amoebic, although a minority is caused by parasites and fungi Option C. Thoracic empyema ; Empyemas are purulent inflammatory collections within a body cavity. Contrast this with abscesses, which arise within parenchymal tissue, rather than occupying a pre-existing anatomical space. Option D. Gastric volvulus ; Gastric volvulus is a specific type of volvulus that occurs when the stomach twists on its mesentery. It should be at least 180\u00b0 and cause bowel obstruction to be called gastric volvulus. Merely gastric rotation on its root is not considered gastric volvulus.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In esophageal rupture secondary to Boerhaave\u2019s syndrome there is failure of the cricopharyngeus muscle to relax in coordination with vomiting. The esophageal tears are typically within the posterolateral aspect of the distal esophagus, several centimeters proximal to the gastroesophageal junction. This area has been demonstrated to be an anatomically weak point. In patients with peptic ulcer disease, the duodenum is more commonly affected than the stomach. Within the duodenum, ulcers are most commonly found within the first portion. Based on preoperative imaging, the sites of gastroduodenal ulcer perforation are typically within the duodenum or are juxtapyloric in location. In patients with small bowel diverticulosis, the diverticula may be categorized as congenital or acquired. In acquired, or true, diverticula, all three layers of the bowel wall are involved. Plain radiography is useful in the initial evaluation of suspected hollow viscus perforation to detect the secondary signs of extraluminal air. However, the precise location and underlying cause of perforation are unlikely to be detected with radiography. CT abdomen with IV contrast is the preferred imaging modality to confirm the presence of free air within the peritoneal cavity  (pneumoperitoneum) and localize the site of the perforated viscus.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Option B: Saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS or SHG) is a procedure to evaluate the uterus and the shape of the uterine cavity. SHG uses ultrasound and sterile fluid to show the uterus and endometrial (uterine lining) cavity. The ovaries are also seen at the time of SHG. SHG should not be performed in women who are pregnant or who are suspected to be pregnant or in women with an active pelvic infection. SHG is usually done after the menstrual period finishes. In women not menstruating (such as those on medications suppressing the menstrual cycle, postmenopausal women, etc.), it may be done at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>A hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is a fluoroscopic examination of the uterus and the fallopian tubes, most commonly used in the investigation of infertility or recurrent spontaneous abortions.
