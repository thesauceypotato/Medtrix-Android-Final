      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Canal wall down mastoidectomy The aim of surgery in middle ear infections is to make the ear safe. Since attic cholesteatoma, in this case, is complicated by lateral sinus thrombosis, modified radical mastoidectomy (canal wall down procedure) will be justified. In this case, the disease will be exteriorised so the cavity can be subsequently examined and cleaned if a cholesteatoma is left behind or recurs. Intact canal wall mastoidectomy and simple mastoidectomy are \"canal wall up\" procedures. Even after removing the cholesteatoma, obliteration of the mastoid cavity runs the risk of burying the cholesteatoma and subsequent complications.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>COMPARISON OF CANAL WALL UP AND CANAL WALL DOWN PROCEDURES Canal wall up procedure Canal wall down procedure Meatus Normal appearance Widely open meatus communicating with mastoid Dependence Does not require routine cleaning Dependence on doctor for cleaning mastoid cavity once or twice a year Recurrence or residual disease High rate of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma Low rate of recurrence or residual disease and thus a safe procedure Second look surgery Requires second look surgery after 6 months or so to rule out cholesteatoma Not required Patients limitations No limitation. Patient allowed swimming Swimming can lead to infection of mastoid cavity and it is thus curtailed Auditory rehabilitation Easy to wear a hearing aid if needed Problems in fitting a hearing aid due to large meatus and mastoid cavity which sometimes gets infected</p>\n<p></p>",

Rosen's incision is the most commonly used for stapedectomy. It requires the meatus and canal to be wide enough to work. It consists of two parts: (i) a small vertical incision at the 12 o\u2019clock position near the annulus and (ii) a curvilinear incision starting at 6 o\u2019clock position to meet the first incision in the posterosuperior region of the canals, 5\u20137 mm away from the annulus.

Lempert I is a semicircular incision from 12 o\u2019clock to 6 o\u2019clock in the posterior meatal wall at the bony\u2013cartilaginous junction. Option: C. Lempert II Starts from the first incision at 12 o\u2019clock and then passes upwards in a curvilinear fashion between the tragus and the crus of the It passes through the incisura terminalis and thus does not cut the cartilage. Option: D. Wilde\u2019s incision starts at the highest attachment of the pinna, follows the curve of the retro auricular groove, lying 1 cm behind it, and ends at the mastoid tip.</p>\n<p></p>",
