The diagnosis should be considered in appropriate cases of progressive cervical myelopathy, paresthesias of the feet and hands, or wasting of the hands. Symptoms Neck and shoulder pain with stiffness (Early) Radicular arm pain- Due to Impingement of bone and soft tissue overgrowth on nerve roots Most common in C5, C6. Asymmetric Slowly progressive spastic paraparesis- Compression of the cervical cord accompanied by paresthesias in the feet and hands. Vibratory sense is diminished in the legs Romberg sign Sensory level for vibration or pinprick on the upper thorax Coughing or straining produces leg weakness or radiating arm or shoulder pain. Dermatomal sensory loss in the arms atrophy of intrinsic hand muscles Increased deep tendon reflexes in the legs , extensor plantar response. A tendon reflex in the arms is often diminished at some level; most often at the biceps (C5-C6). Advanced cases Urinary urgency or In individual cases, radicular, myelopathic, or combined signs may predominate.

The common causes are tumor , epidural abscess or hematoma , herniated disk, and spondylotic vertebral pathology. Epidural compression due to malignancy or abscess often causes warning signs of neck or back pain, bladder disturbances, and sensory symptoms that precede the development of paralysis. Spinal subluxation, hemorrhage , and noncompressive etiologies such as infarction are more likely to produce myelopathy without antecedent symptoms. MRI with gadolinium, centered on the clinically suspected level, is the initial diagnostic procedure if it is available; it is often appropriate to image the entire spine (cervical through sacral regions) to search for additional clinically silent lesions. Once compressive lesions have been excluded, noncompressive causes of acute myelopathy that are intrinsic to the cord are considered, primarily vascular, inflammatory, and infectious etiology.</p>\n<p></p>",
