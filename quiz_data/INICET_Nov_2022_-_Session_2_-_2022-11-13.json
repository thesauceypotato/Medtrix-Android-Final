The fibers of the fornix arise from the hippocampus, which is involved in the formation and consolidation of memories, and then project through the fornix to other parts of the limbic system.

Caudate Nucleus : The caudate nucleus is a component of the basal ganglia and is involved in motor control and cognitive functions.

Purpose : The goal of PMCS is to improve maternal and fetal outcomes by relieving the compression of the inferior vena cava (IVC) by the gravid uterus, which enhances venous return and diaphragmatic displacement. This, in turn, improves respiratory dynamics and resuscitative efforts. Fetal Outcome : The infant has a higher chance of survival if PMCS is performed within 10 minutes of maternal death. Surgical Technique : A classical upper-segment cesarean section with a vertical uterine incision is performed. Location : PMCS does not need to be done in the operating theatre (OT); it can be done wherever the patient is located to expedite the process.</li><li>\u2022 Timing : According to the AHA 2020 Guidelines for CPR, perimortem cesarean should be considered if there is no return of spontaneous circulation within 5 minutes in a pregnant woman who has experienced total cardiopulmonary arrest.</li><li>\u2022 Timing</li><li>\u2022 Purpose : The goal of PMCS is to improve maternal and fetal outcomes by relieving the compression of the inferior vena cava (IVC) by the gravid uterus, which enhances venous return and diaphragmatic displacement.

A) B, A, C, D</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The sequence of cardinal movements in the mechanism of labor is a series of positions and motions that the fetus goes through as it navigates through the birth canal. These movements are:</li><li>\u2022 Engagement : This is when the fetal head enters the pelvic inlet and the widest part of the head has passed through the pelvic brim. Descent : The downward movement of the fetal head within the pelvic inlet. Flexion : The fetal head bends so the chin is brought closer to the chest, presenting the smallest diameter to the birth canal. Internal Rotation : The fetal head rotates to align with the maternal pelvis. Extension : The fetal head extends as it passes under the symphysis pubis, followed by the crowning (the fetal head remains visible at the vulva without slipping back). Crowning : The fetal head is visible at the vulva without slipping back. Restitution : The fetal head rotates to the position it was in when it engaged in the pelvis. External Rotation : The fetal shoulders rotate to align with the head.
