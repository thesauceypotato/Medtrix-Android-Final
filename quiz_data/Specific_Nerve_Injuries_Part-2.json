This includes splintage, hand therapy, and steroid injection has been proven to be beneficial. Alternatively, a patient could be referred for either open or endoscopic release. Clinical Features Women Men = 8: 1; age group 40-50 Burning pain, paraesthesia, tingling and numbness in the distribution of median nerve, increased by activities, most troublesome in night and relieved by hanging the arm over the side of bed, or shaking the arm. Clumsiness & weakness in tasks requiring fine manipulation such as fastening buttons. Sensory symptoms can often be reproduced by percussing over the median nerve (Tinel's sign) or by holding the wrist fully flexed for a minute or two (Phalen's test) One specific test is Durken's test(Carpal compression test) which produces paresthesia in response to compression In late cases weakness of thumb abduction and wasting of thenar muscles occur. Splints, NSAID's corticosteroid injection & open surgical division of transverse carpal ligament ae methods of management.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B.
