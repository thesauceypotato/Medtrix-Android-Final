Liver cirrhosis is primarily caused by alcoholic behavior. It causes portal hypertension. Hence, esophageal varices occur in the esophagus, a site of the Portacaval anastomoses. It causes hematemesis. Excessive blood loss causes shock. Endoscopic band ligation can be done for treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Esophageal cancers are caused by smoking and poorly controlled acid reflux. The symptoms include trouble in swallowing, unintentional weight loss, chest pain, angina, and coughing or hoarseness. There is no enlargement of the esophageal veins. Hence, it is the wrong answer. Option: B. GERD is a gastroesophageal reflux disorder due to the malfunctioning of the lower esophageal sphincter. It doesn\u2019t cause hematemesis and shock. Hence, it is the wrong answer. Option: C. Esophagitis is the inflammation of the esophagus that can be due to bacterial infections.

Culdocentesis is the process of fluid extraction from the rectouterine pouch of Douglas . This is performed by inserting a needle through the posterior fornix of the vagina. It is used to extract excess fluid from the peritoneal cavity or to drain a pelvic abscess in the rectouterine pouch in cases of ovarian cysts and ectopic pregnancies.

It is a prenatal diagnostic test. Here, an ultrasound transducer is used to determine the fetus's and umbilical cord's position. Then a fetal blood sample is then collected from the umbilical cord for further testing. Hence, it is the wrong answer. Option: B. Paracentesis is also a type of body fluid sampling procedure. It is also referred to as peritoneocentesis, paracentesis, or abdominal paracentesis. Here, the peritoneal cavity is punctured by a needle to sample peritoneal fluid or remove the excess liquid. Hence, it is the wrong answer. Option: D. Cystocentesis is a veterinary procedure. Here, a needle is placed into the urinary bladder through the abdominal wall to remove a urine sample or assist in micturition in some conditions. Hence, it is the wrong answer.</p>\n<p></p>",

It can cause obstructive jaundice (Icterus) due to obstruction of the biliary tract. In obstructive jaundice, the bile pigments aren't released into the GIT. Hence the stool is light-colored. Also, lacking bile salts reduces fat absorption, resulting in less dense (floating) and foul-smelling stool. Pancreatic head cancer can result in obstructive jaundice; hence it is the correct answer. The head and uncinate process of the pancreas is closely related to the bile duct. Accordingly, cancer can compress it, resulting in obstructive jaundice.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

Hence, a maneuver that involves clamping of this artery is called the Pringle maneuver. The patient is suffering from severe liver cirrhosis as he is an alcoholic. The brutal blood loss is due to variceal bleeding caused by portal hypertension. The surgeon can stop the bleeding by preventing blood flow to the liver. This is done by obliterating the hepatic artery. Pringle maneuver is the clamping of the portal triad in the hepatoduodenal ligament, a part of the lesser omentum. The hepatic artery is one of the blood supplies to the liver. Hence, clamping would restrict blood flow significantly, thus stopping the bleeding to an extent. Therefore, it is the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Kocher maneuver is the dissection of the peritoneal attachments of the duodenum laterally. It is done to create a space for inspecting the duodenum, pancreas, and other retroperitoneal structures.

After the completion, the inferior vena cava, the abdominal part of the aorta below the superior mesenteric artery, and the retroperitoneal organs on the right side are exposed. Hence, it is the wrong answer. Option: D. Mattox maneuver is an experimental technique to access the left and central retroperitoneal organs and vessels. Hence, it is the wrong answer.</p>\n<p></p>",
