      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Spigelian hernia Here, the abdominal contents herniate through the linea semilunaris of the rectus sheath . The hernia is not prominent as the others due to the fibrous nature of the aponeurosis forming the linea semilunaris. Differential diagnosis includes appendicitis, hematoma of the rectus sheath, and diverticulosis. Spigelian hernia is a hernia that occurs through the Spigelian fascia (it is the combined ventral aponeuroses of the external abdominal oblique, internal abdominal oblique, and transversus abdominis muscles). It protrudes to a small extent due to the toughness of the Spigelian fascia along the linea semilunaris. The symptoms include changes in bowel function, constipation, bleeding, and abdominal pain when lifting, coughing, or having a bowel movement. Hence, it is the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Diverticulitis is the inflammation of the out pouches seen in diverticulosis. The bacterial biome in the colon will be significantly altered in these cases. But the vignette shows an average bacterial count. Hence, it is the wrong answer. Option: B. Richter\u2019s hernia is a rare type of strangulation that is distinct from the other types of hernia as only one wall of the intestine gets herniated. The common sites of this hernia include the femoral ring, inguinal canal, and incision sites. Hence, it is the wrong answer. Option: C. Parastomal hernia is a type of incisional hernia wherein the abdominal contents herniate through a site of the earlier incision. They commonly occur along the line of alba. Hence, it is the wrong answer.</p>\n<p></p>",
