The condition is most commonly asymptomatic .

The reaction is thought to be caused by the release of cytokines, specifically tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8), as a result of the immune respons e to the bacterial infection. These cytokines are known to cause fever, chills, headache , and other flu-like symptoms that can occur shortly after treatment is started. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is generally self-limited and does not require specific treatment , although symptomatic relief may be provided with medications such as acetaminophen .

Modes of spread: By ingestion of infected food or milk (primary intestinal TB) or infected sputum (secondary intestinal TB) Contagious spread from infected adjacent foci Hematogenous spread from distant TB focus Through lymphatic channels Direct contact with an infected animal (Mycobacterium bovis) Medical Therapy : A standard four-drug regimen, consisting of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, is recommended for ATT in intra-abdominal/gastrointestinal tuberculosis.
