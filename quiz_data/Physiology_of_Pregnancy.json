      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Positive feedback mechanism Many control systems operate within the organs to control the function of individual parts of the organ. Positive feedback can lead to instability in some cases. Initiating stimulus causes more of the same stimulus creating a vicious cycle. Other examples are Blood clotting, LH surge, action potential, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The feedback mechanism is the physiological regulatory system in a living body that works to return the body to the normal internal state or homeostasis. A positive feedback mechanism, as the name suggests, is a pathway that in response to a deviation in the output causes the output to change even more in the direction of the initial deviation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A: It is a stabilizing mechanism . Majority of control systems work by this mechanism. It helps to maintain homeostasis. E.g. Baroreceptors, temperature control, secretion of hormones, etc Options C and D: Feedforward and adaptive control are the same thing. It is anticipatory control; no stimulus is required e.g., salivation in anticipation of food, wearing woolen clothes before going out in winter, changing stance while climbing stairs, etc.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The production of hCG by trophoblast cells Menstruation normally occurs in a nonpregnant woman about 14 days after ovulation, at which time most of the endometrium of the uterus sloughs away from the uterine wall and is expelled to the exterior. If this should happen after an ovum has been implanted, the pregnancy would terminate. However, this sloughing is prevented by the secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) by the newly developing embryonic tissues. hCG also inhibits ovulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. Higher prolactin levels between 50-100 ng/mL may cause irregular menstrual periods and significantly decrease a woman's fertility. Option C. Prostaglandins in the corpus luteum (CL) reportedly serve as luteotropic and luteolytic agents. Option D. The follicular phase ends with the abrupt elevation of serum LH (and FSH) levels that causes the rupture of the follicle and the release of its mature oocyte (ovulation).</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Only after priming of the uterine endometrium by progesterone and estrogen Progesterone prepares the endometrium to receive and nourish a fertilized egg . If pregnancy does not occur, estrogen and progesterone levels decrease. The decrease in progesterone triggers menstruation or the shedding of the lining. Once the lining is completely shed, a new menstrual cycle begins.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The rapidly increasing progesterone secreted by the ovarian corpus luteum; first promotes increasing progesterone receptors on the fallopian tube smooth muscle cells; then the progesterone activates the receptors, exerting a tubular relaxing effect that allows entry of the ovum into the uterus. After reaching the uterus, the developing blastocyst usually remains in the uterine cavity an additional 1 to 3 days before it implants in the endometrium; thus, implantation ordinarily occurs on about the fifth to seventh day after ovulation. Before implantation, the blastocyst obtains its nutrition from the uterine endometrial secretions, called \u201cuterine milk.\u201d When the conceptus implants in the endometrium, the continued secretion of progesterone causes the endometrial cells to swell further and to store even more nutrients. These cells are now called decidual cells, and the total mass of cells is called the decidua.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Rest Options are not correct because Option A. In humans, the embryo reaches the uterus in the early blastocyst stage, around 6 days after ovulation . At this stage, the embryo consists of 50 to 150 cells (blastomeres) with a fluid-filled cavity (blastocoele). The blastomeres have differentiated into the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass. Option B. Functional and morphological changes that occur within the endometrium to form the decidual lining into which the blastocyst implants. Option C. The zygote travels down the fallopian tube, where it becomes a morula. Once it reaches the uterus, the morula becomes a blastocyst. The blastocyst then burrows into the uterine lining \u2014 a process called implantation.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube. The ova remains fertile in the fallopian tube for 12 to 24 hours. Sperms undergo capacitation in the oviduct and remain fertile for up to 48 hours. The blastocyst enters the endometrial cavity on the sixth day, with implantation occurring on the seventh day. Trophoblastic tissue is the driving force for implantation; the presence of the endometrium is not required. The corpus luteum is \u201crescued\u201d from regression by hCG secreted by the syncytiotrophoblasts. The corpus luteum produces progesterone until about 8 to 10 weeks when the developing placenta can maintain progesterone production. Early secretion of progesterone by the corpus luteum is important in the maintenance of early pregnancy. Prolactin is necessary for milk production, which is maintained after delivery by the infant\u2019s suckling. Oxytocin is necessary for milk ejection.</p>\n<p></p>",

The female pronucleus is the female egg cell once it has become a haploid cell, and the male pronucleus forms when the sperm enters into the female egg.
