In presence of liver damage- short-acting benzodiazepines, such as oxazepam or lorazepam, are preferred. Thiamine must be administered before giving glucose, to prevent the precipitation of Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy. For delirium tremens, intravenous benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice, parenteral thiamine (and other B vitamins) must be administered,  and antipsychotics can be used to manage hallucinations and agitation.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>\u21b3 Reference: Kaplan & Sadock\u2019s Synopsis of Psychiatry, 12th edition, Page No 281.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
