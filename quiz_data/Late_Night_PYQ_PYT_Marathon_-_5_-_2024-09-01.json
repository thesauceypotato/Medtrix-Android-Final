This is because slight movements stimulate the biological processes necessary for bone healing, including the proliferation of blood vessels and the development of new bone tissue. These micro movements encourage the formation of a callus, which is an essential part of the fracture healing process.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Rigid immobilization: While immobilization is crucial to prevent displacement of the fracture, it also limits movement at the fracture site, which can delay callus formation by preventing the necessary biological stimulus.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Rigid immobilization:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Compression plating: This method provides rigid stabilization to the fracture site, reducing movement and thereby typically not promoting significant callus formation. Compression plating is more associated with primary bone healing without visible callus formation.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Compression plating:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Intraosseous nailing: Like compression plating, intraosseous nailing stabilizes the fracture internally, limiting micro movements.

Congenital curvatures are due to anomalous development of the vertebrae (failure of formation and/or segmentation). In most cases, congenital scolioses are non-hereditary. It is believed to be related to an insult to the fetus during spine embryological development (between the 5 th -8 th week of gestation). 25% of curves are non-progressive, 25% mildly progressive and 50% highly progressive and will require treatment. The mainstay of treatment is either observation or surgery. The rigidity of the curve is assessed, and the rib hump measured. Associated malformations must be looked for clinically: look for foot or leg asymmetry, craniofacial malformation, a Klippel-Feil web neck, and cardiac and urinary malformations. Full-body-width Postero-anterior (PA) and lateral X-rays are essential. After 1 year of age, X-rays should be taken standing, with the legs in extension and the pelvis level, to compensate for any leg length discrepancy. The Cobb angle will be measured. CT scans shows a bony bar. Congenital scoliosis can be classified into defect of formation or defect of segmentation: Fully segmented hemivertebra (two growth plates) with a contralateral bar Unilateral unsegmented bar Two consecutives fully segmented hemivertebrae Fully segmented hemivertebra Semi segmented hemivertebra Wedge vertebra (partial failure of formation) Incarcerated hemivertebra (smaller and induce little deformity as the hemivertebra sits in a non-growing block; the alignment of the pedicles usually remains straight)</li><li>\u2022 Congenital scoliosis is the most frequent congenital deformity of the spine.</li><li>\u2022 Congenital curvatures are due to anomalous development of the vertebrae (failure of formation and/or segmentation).</li><li>\u2022 In most cases, congenital scolioses are non-hereditary.</li><li>\u2022 It is believed to be related to an insult to the fetus during spine embryological development (between the 5 th -8 th week of gestation).</li><li>\u2022 25% of curves are non-progressive, 25% mildly progressive and 50% highly progressive and will require treatment.</li><li>\u2022 The mainstay of treatment is either observation or surgery.</li><li>\u2022 The rigidity of the curve is assessed, and the rib hump measured.</li><li>\u2022 Associated malformations must be looked for clinically: look for foot or leg asymmetry, craniofacial malformation, a Klippel-Feil web neck, and cardiac and urinary malformations.</li><li>\u2022 Full-body-width Postero-anterior (PA) and lateral X-rays are essential.</li><li>\u2022 After 1 year of age, X-rays should be taken standing, with the legs in extension and the pelvis level, to compensate for any leg length discrepancy.</li><li>\u2022 The Cobb angle will be measured.</li><li>\u2022 CT scans shows a bony bar.</li><li>\u2022 Congenital scoliosis can be classified into defect of formation or defect of segmentation: Fully segmented hemivertebra (two growth plates) with a contralateral bar Unilateral unsegmented bar Two consecutives fully segmented hemivertebrae Fully segmented hemivertebra Semi segmented hemivertebra Wedge vertebra (partial failure of formation) Incarcerated hemivertebra (smaller and induce little deformity as the hemivertebra sits in a non-growing block; the alignment of the pedicles usually remains straight)</li><li>\u2022 Fully segmented hemivertebra (two growth plates) with a contralateral bar Unilateral unsegmented bar Two consecutives fully segmented hemivertebrae Fully segmented hemivertebra Semi segmented hemivertebra Wedge vertebra (partial failure of formation) Incarcerated hemivertebra (smaller and induce little deformity as the hemivertebra sits in a non-growing block; the alignment of the pedicles usually remains straight)</li><li>\u2022 Fully segmented hemivertebra (two growth plates) with a contralateral bar</li><li>\u2022 Unilateral unsegmented bar</li><li>\u2022 Two consecutives fully segmented hemivertebrae</li><li>\u2022 Fully segmented hemivertebra</li><li>\u2022 Semi segmented hemivertebra</li><li>\u2022 Wedge vertebra (partial failure of formation)</li><li>\u2022 Incarcerated hemivertebra (smaller and induce little deformity as the hemivertebra sits in a non-growing block; the alignment of the pedicles usually remains straight)</li><li>\u2022 Treatment: Treatment consists of either observation of the curve or surgery, or, rarely, bracing. Observation should be applied only for non-progressive curves with a balanced spine. Bracing is inefficient in congenital scoliosis. It may be indicated for long flexible curves or to control the compensatory lumbar curve or help rebalancing the spine, or it may be used after an operation, for instance, until the fusion is solid. Surgery is the mainstay of care. Prophylactic surgery: surgery that will prevent further worsening or allow progressive correction over time. These operations are in situ fusion and hemi epiphysiodesis. In situ fusion can be done with a single posterior fusion, with or without instrumentation or with an anterior fusion, or a 360\u00b0 fusion.</li><li>\u2022 Treatment: Treatment consists of either observation of the curve or surgery, or, rarely, bracing.
