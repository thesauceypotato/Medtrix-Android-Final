Ophthalmic division Ophthalmic nerve- Passes through the lateral portion of the cavernous sinus, then through the superior orbital fissure into the orbit.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Buccinator The food getting stuck between the cheek and teeth while eating, is due to buccinator muscle.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The buccinator muscle is a facial muscle that is responsible for compressing the cheeks and expelling air between the lips, such as in blowing a trumpet. It is also involved in mastication and holding food in the mouth while chewing. Its purpose is to pull back the angle of the mouth and to flatten the cheek area, which aids in holding the cheek to the teeth during chewing. This action causes the muscle to keep food pushed back on the occlusal surface of the posterior teeth, as when a person chews.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Levator labii superioris The levator labii superioris muscle elevates and everts the upper lip. This action is used when expressing some facial expressions Option: C. Zygomaticus major The zygomaticus major muscle, also known as the smiling muscle, is responsible for raising the upper lip and corners of the mouth to create facial expressions. Option: D. Orbicularis oris The orbicularis oris muscle contributes to the form and shape of the lips. Contraction of this muscle closes and protects the lips.</p>\n<p></p>",
