The clotted blood becomes fluid, so the position of the postmortem staining is altered, and the fluid blood collects in the serous cavities. Putrefactive effusion of foul-smelling blood-stained fluid into the pleural cavities usually ~tarts at about the time when the skin becomes macerated. Such effusions usually do not exceed 60 to 100 ml. unless death results from drowning, when several hundred ml. of drowning medium, which oozed out through the lungs and visceral pleura, may be present in the thoracic cavities.

The maggots become pupae (dark-brown, barrel-shaped, 6 mm. in length) in 3 to 6 days, and the pupae become adult flies in three to six days.
