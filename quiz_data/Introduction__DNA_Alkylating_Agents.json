Tetrahydrofolic acid is responsible for the synthesis of several amino acids, purines, and thymidine, a required molecule for DNA synthesis. By inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, methotrexate induces a deficiency of tetrahydrofolic acid in the setting of normal folate levels.

These metabolic abnormalities can then lead to renal failure and possibly multiple organ failure and death. This syndrome can be prevented with aggressive intravenous hydration and the administration of allopurinol. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that reduces uric acid production. Keep in mind that normal uric acid levels in children are lower than those for adults (2.0-5.5 mg/dL.) Uric acid production increases dramatically during puberty, and males reach adult uric acid levels between the ages of 12 and 14.

These autoantibodies have been associated with an encephalomyelitis with a diverse array of presenting features that include slurred speech and gait anomalies. Her smoking history puts her at risk for SCLC. Treatment for SCLC involves a platinum agent such as carboplatin or cisplatin in combination with etoposide. The stabilization of the topoisomerase II-DNA complex during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle by etoposide results in the induction of double-stranded DNA breaks and prevents the completion of the G2 phase. Side effects of etoposide include bone marrow suppression, alopecia, and nausea and vomiting.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. is not correct: The prevention of progression through the cell cycle by etoposide causes cells to undergo apoptosis rather than necrosis.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dactinomycin (actinomycin D) Dactinomycin is used to treat some kinds of cancer that affect the testicles (testicular cancer), uterus, or womb (gestational trophoblastic neoplasia), kidneys (Wilms' tumor), bones and muscles (Ewing's sarcoma).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: C. Dactinomycin intercalates between and eventually binds to DNA base pairs. This distortion of the DNA chains makes the DNA an unsuitable template for RNA polymerase, and ultimately RNA and protein synthesis is inhibited. Dactinomycin is cell cycle-nonspecific. It is the drug of choice for Wilm\u2019s tumor and is the 2nd drug for ectopic pregnancy. Option : A. Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor. This is an oral agent used for postmenopausal women with early or advanced breast cancer. In postmenopausal women, the major source of estrogen (which supports the growth and replication of estrogen-dependent tumors) is androgens. Those androgens are metabolized by aromatase to estrogens. As a result, anastrozole depletes estrogens and can arrest tumor cell growth. Option: B . Cytarabine (also called cytosine arabinoside) is a pyrimidine analog (antimetabolite) that is metabolized to the active moiety, ara-CTP. The ara-CTP becomes incorporated into DNA, with the main ultimate effect being; the suppression of DNA synthesis. It is highly specific for cells in S-phase. Fluorouracil, also an antimetabolite, inhibits thymidylate synthetase. It is not phase-specific, but its activity depends on cells not being in the G0 stage.</p>\n<p></p>",

For CLL it is a preferred treatment. It is given by mouth. Common side effects include bone marrow suppression. Option: D. Melphalan is a chemotherapy medication used to treat multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, melanoma, and AL amyloidosis. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein.

Nausea and vomiting are common as are teratogenesis and gonadal atrophy, although in the latter cases these are variable, according to the drug, its schedule, and route of administration. Treatment also carries a major risk of leukemogenesis and carcinogenesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Alkylating\nagents: Nitrogen\nMustards Bendamustine Cyclophosphamide Estramustine Ifosfamide Mechlorethamine Melphalan Platinum\nanalogs 7.
