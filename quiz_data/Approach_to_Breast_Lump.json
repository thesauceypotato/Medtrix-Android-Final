The rash began as small vesicles on the nipple and spread to the areola. It has become a painful ulcer with a yellow, watery discharge that is occasionally blood-tinged. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled salbutamol. Her younger sister was diagnosed with endometrial cancer a year ago. Examination shows a weeping, ulcerated lesion involving the entire left nipple-areolar complex. There are no breast masses, dimpling, or axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Mastitis is characterised by tenderness, warmth, erythema, and oedema of the affected breast and nipples, as well as reactive lymphadenopathy. All of these findings are seen in this patient. However, mastitis typically develops in breastfeeding women , most frequently within a month postpartum, making this diagnosis unlikely in this postmenopausal woman. Option: C.

However, a breast examination would typically reveal a new, fluctuant mass rather than the persistent breast lump found in this patient, which has already been present for a year.

Menarche was at the age of 14, and her last menstrual period was at the age of 51. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a non-tender, firm, hard mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Mammography shows large, dense breasts, with a 1.7 cm mass in the right upper outer quadrant. The patient undergoes right upper outer quadrant lumpectomy with subsequent sentinel node biopsy, which reveals moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma and micro-metastasis to one axillary lymph node.

This patient's findings of moderately differentiated tumor cells are consistent with an intermediate histologic tumor grade . While higher histologic grades negatively affect the prognosis in breast cancer patients , nodal status is a more important factor. Option: C. A positive HER2 receptor status in breast cancer patients is associated with aggressive tumor growth, high-grade tumors, and a poor prognosis , especially if the oestrogen and progesterone hormone receptor status is also negative. Since this patient's HER2 receptor status is negative, it does not have a negative impact on this patient's prognosis. Regardless, another factor is even more important. Option: D. While a positive receptor status is a risk factor for increased cancer growth, a negative receptor status is associated with a poorer prognosis since it means targeted hormone therapy cannot be given.

The examination begins with the patient in an upright sitting position.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For All Options:- Option: A. The breasts are visually inspected for obvious masses, asymmetries, and skin changes. The examiner supports the patient\u2019s arm and palpates each axilla from a posterior approach to detect the presence of enlarged axillary lymph nodes. The supraclavicular and infraclavicular spaces are similarly palpated for enlarged nodes. Palpation of the breast is always done with the patient lying supine on a solid examining surface, with the arm stretched above the head. Palpation of the breast while the patient is sitting often leads to inaccurate interpretation because the overlapping breast tissue may feel like a mass, or a mass may go undetected within the breast tissue. Option: B. Eczema begins on the areola , whereas Paget disease originates on the nipple and secondarily involves the areola. Option: C. Dimpling of the skin or nipple retraction is a sensitive and specific sign of underlying cancer . Still, flattening or inversion of the nipple can also be seen in subareolar duct ectasia . The finding is frequently bilateral in these cases, with a long history confirming the condition. Option: D. Fibroadenomas, cysts, and carcinomas can all be firm on Palpation.

The primary imaging modality for screening asymptomatic women is mammography . Statement 2. On screening mammography, two views of each breast are obtained and readied later. Diagnostic mammography is read during the performance so that additional views may be performed, like magnification or compression views. Statement 3. Mammography in women younger than 30, whose breast tissue is dense with stroma and epithelium, produces an image without many definitions . As women age, the breast tissue is involuted and is replaced by fatty tissue. So, on mammography, fat absorbs relatively little radiation and provides a contrasting background that favours the detection of small lesions. USG is preferred in younger patients. Statement 4.

If used with appropriate shielding, mammography carries a limited risk to the foetus. The mammographic parenchymal density increases and becomes diffuse.
