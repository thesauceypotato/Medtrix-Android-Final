      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Early syphilis Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction- occurs due to the release of endotoxin when large numbers of organisms are killed by antibiotics. It is seen in early syphilis. It can start between 1 and 12 hours after antibiotics are started It is seen in 50% of patients with primary syphilis and about 90% of patients with secondary syphili It is not a dose-related phenomenon; Symptoms: Fever, chills, muscle pains, and headaches It is self-limiting and usually resolves within 24 to 48 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Treatment : Early syphilis Inj Benzathine Penicillin G 2.4 MIU I.M Penicillin allergic patients: Cap. Doxycycline 100mg BD for 14 days Latent syphilis Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 mIU I.M 3 doses at weekly interval Neurosyphilis Aqueous Crystalline Penicillin</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Late congenital syphilis: It is not correct as the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is not typically seen in congenital syphilis. Option C. Latent syphilis: It is not associated with clinical manifestations, and Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is not seen unless treatment is initiated. Option D. Syphilis of the cardiovascular system: It is also not correct, as it refers to tertiary syphilis, which is typically asymptomatic and not treated with penicillin, so there is no reason for the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction to occur.</p>\n<p></p>",
