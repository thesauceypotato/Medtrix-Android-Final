Decreased anterior brain metabolism which is generally more pronounced on the left side. Again, evidence suggests that antidepressants at least partially normalize these changes. Point 2. Depression may be associated with a relative increase in nondominant hemispheric activity Point 3. A reversal of hypofrontality occurs after shifts from depression into hypomania , such that greater left hemisphere reductions are seen in depression compared with greater right hemisphere reductions in mania. Point 4. Reduction or reduced cerebral blood flow or metabolism, or both, in the dopaminergically innervated tracts of the mesocortical and mesolimbic systems occur in depression. Point 5. In addition to a global reduction of anterior cerebral metabolism, increased glucose metabolism has been observed in several limbic regions , particularly among patients with relatively severe recurrent depression and a family history of mood disorder. During episodes of depression, increased glucose metabolism is correlated with intrusive ruminations Therefore , Option C is correct.</p>\n<p></p>",
