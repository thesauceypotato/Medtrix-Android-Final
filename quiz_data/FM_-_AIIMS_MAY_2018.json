Generally, statements in affidavits are presumed to have been made on personal knowledge , unless it appears affirmatively, or by fair inference, that they could not have been, and were not on such knowledge. In the court procedures, this phrase refers to the personal understanding of circumstances and events, which is retold and explained by a witness in a courtroom , during a court hearing on the concrete lawsuit. In other words, the witness has been an eye-witness of these circumstances or events and so has accepted directly. Therefore, they have clear and detailed personal knowledge of it.

Meconium is seen at the end of the large intestine. Scrotum is wrinkled and contains both testes. Placenta weighs 500 g. Ossification centers are usually present in the lower end of the femur. Tenth month (full-term child) Length 48 to 52 cm; crown-rump length 28 to 32 cm; weight 2.5 to 5 kg; average about 3\u20134 kg. The length is much less variable than the weight. The length is much less variable than the weight. The male infant weighs about 100 g. more than the female. The circumference of the head is 33 to 38 cm. Six fontanels are usually present in the neonatal skull. The anterior fontanel (bregma) is located at the junction of sagittal and coronal sutures. The posterior fontanel (occipital) lies at the junction of sagittal and lambdoid sutures. At each sphenoparietal junction, a lateral fontanel is present. The poster lateral fontanels (mastoid) as located at the mastoid- occipital junctions. Anterior fontanel is 4 x 2.5 cm. At full term the head of a child is nearly one-fourth of the whole length of the body. The surface of the brain shows convolutions and the grey matter begins to form. The scalp hair is dark, 3 to 5 em long. The face is not wrinkled. Lanugo is absent except on the shoulders. The skin is pale and covered with vernix caseosa. The nails project beyond the end of fingers, but reach only the tip of the toes. The cartilages have formed in the nose and ears. The testes are present in the scrotum ; vulva is closed and labia minora are covered by full developed labia majora. The rectum contains dark brownish, green or black meconium. The umbilicus is situated midway between pubis and xiphoid cartilage. The umbilical cord is 50 to 55 cm. long, and one em. thick. The center of ossification is found in the lower end of femur and sometimes in the cuboid and in the upper end of the tibia.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A.5 months-Ossification centers are present in the middle segments of the sacrum. Option B.6 months-The testes are seen close to the kidneys. Option D.8 months- foetal length 40 cm .</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Rule of Hasse : This is a rough method of calculating the age of the fetus. The length of the foetus is measured from the crown to the heel in centimetres. During the first five months of pregnancy the square root of the length gives the approximate age of the foetus in months, e.g. a foetus of 16 em. is four months. Morrison's Law: During the last five months, the length in em. divided by five gives the age in months , e.g, A fetus of 35 em. is 7 months.</p>\n<p></p>",

They are not bacterial poisons and are not derived from bacteria. They are found only when the food becomes too disagreeable to be eaten . Most of the ptomaines are non-poisonous except neurine and mydalien , which are produced in traces 5 to 7 days after death. The symptoms resemble that of Ptomaines are not the causative agents of food poisoning.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A . Ptomaine -These are alkaloidal bodies which are formed as the result of bacterial decomposition of protein. When they are formed in the dead tissues, they are known as cadaveric alkaloids. Option B. Serotonin-Serotonin is a chemical that carries messages between nerve cells in the brain and throughout your body. Serotonin plays a key role in such body functions as mood, sleep, digestion, nausea, wound healing, bone health, blood clotting and sexual desire. Option C.
