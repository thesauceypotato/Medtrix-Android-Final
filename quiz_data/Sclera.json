When the deep episcleral plexus does not blanch, the diagnosis is usually scleritis. Option: C. Episcleritis is a relatively common, benign, self-limited inflammation of the episcleral tissues. However, if the condition does not resolve in 3 weeks , a systemic workup should be done to rule out systemic involvement. Approximately 26-36% of patients have an associated systemic disorder.

It is important to differentiate episcleritis from scleritis since they differ in terms of prognosis and their association with systemic diseases. Scleritis, which is much less common than episcleritis, is more commonly associated with connective tissue or vasculitic diseases than episcleritis. Moreover, ocular complications such as decreased vision, anterior uveitis, peripheral ulcerative keratitis, and ocular hypertension are more commonly seen in scleritis than in episcleritis. Option: C. Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis is a nodular inflammation of the cornea or conjunctiva that results from a hypersensitivity reaction to a foreign antigen. It was historically seen in poor, malnourished children with positive tuberculin skin tests. Currently, microbial proteins of Staphylococcus aureus are the most common causative antigens in phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis. Risk factors for S. aureus exposure include chronic blepharitis and suppurative keratitis. Option: D. Ochronosis (Alkaptonuria): Homogentisic acid accumulates and is metabolized into melanin-like compounds with brown pigmentation of cartilage (ear, nose, heart valves) and sclera.

Anterior necrotizing scleritis with inflammation: It is an acute severe form of scleritis characterised by intense localised inflammation associated with areas of infarction due to vasculitis. The affected necrosed area is thinned out and the sclera becomes transparent and ectatic with uveal tissue shining through it. It is usually associated with anterior uveitis . Option: C. Anterior necrotizing scleritis without inflammation (scleromalacia perforans): This specific entity typically occurs in elderly females usually suffering from longstanding rheumatoid arthritis. It is characterised by development of yellowish patch of melting sclera (due to obliteration of arterial supply); which often together with the overlying episclera and conjunctiva completely separates from the surrounding normal sclera. This sequestrum of sclera becomes dead white in colour, which eventually absorbs leaving behind it a large punched out area of thin sclera through which the uveal tissue shines. Spontaneous perforation is extremely rare. Option: D. Posterior scleritis: It is an inflammation involving the sclera behind the equator. The condition is frequently misdiagnosed. It is characterised by features of associated inflammation of adjacent structures, which include: Exudative retinal detachment, Macular oedema, Proptosis and Limitation of ocular movements</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>It is treated by: Topical steroids Oral steroids on heavy doses tapered slowly.

The autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common systemic association of scleritis and is characterized by a symmetrical deforming inflammatory polyarthropathy, with a spectrum of possible extra-articular manifestations.

All forms of immune-mediated scleritis have been described in RA and the clinical course is often more aggressive than when there is no systemic association. Other ocular manifestations of RA include keratoconjunctivitis sicca (secondary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome), ulcerative keratitis and acquired superior oblique tendon sheath syndrome (very rare). Option: C. Crohn\u2019s disease is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory bowel disease of unknown cause. Extraintestinal complications occur frequently during the course of the disease. The commonest of these are peripheral arthritis and erythema nodosum.

Acute anterior scleritis is rare and may be complicated by the development of scleromalacia perforans. Acute episcleritis and increased bowel activity show a close correlation. Option: D. Relapsing polychondritis is a rare idiopathic condition characterized by small vessel vasculitis involving cartilage resulting in recurrent, often progressive, inflammatory episodes involving multiple organ systems such as the ears, nasal cartilage, respiratory system, heart and joints.
