The most common cause of primary polycythemia is polycythemia vera , a myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with mutations that lead to erythropoietin-independent growth of red cell progenitors . Polycythemia presents with Aquagenic pruritus ie pruritus seen due to warm bath because of Basophil lysis . Secondary causes of Polycythemia include: Hypoxia COPD Smoking Cyanosis heart disease High altitude Tumours Renal Cell carcinoma Hemangioblastoma</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Raised ESR. False , in polycythemia vera , ESR is decreased due to a decrease in rouleaux formation or an increase in the RBC surface area to volume ratio . Option: B. Decreased LAP score. False , LAP score is increased Option: C. Thrombocytopenia. False , Thrombocytosis is seen because of Panmyelosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Criteria for diagnosis of Polycythemia Vera (PCV): Polycythemia vera (PCV) is characterized by increased marrow production of red cells, granulocytes, and platelets (panmyelosis), but it is the increase in red cells (polycythemia) that is responsible for most of the clinical symptoms.
