Low; on or below the thyroid cartilage. 3.      Direction: Above downwards and from left to right in right-handed person. Sometimes horizontal cuts across the front of the neck are seen which do not show variation in depth at either end. Transverse or from below upwards.

Multiple, cross each other at a deep level; not repeated in depths of the main wound. 5.      Edges: Usually rugged due to overlapping of multiple superficial incisions.

Vessels: As head is thrown back, carotid artery is drawn beneath sternomastoid and against the spine and usually escapes injury. Jugular vein and carotid artery are likely to be cut. 14. Blood stains: If standing, stains on the mirror and on front of body and clothes running from above downwards and splashes on feet. If asleep, blood runs down on both sides of the neck and collects behind the neck and shoulder, stains found on both palms, for the victim attempts to cover the wound. 15. Clothes: Not cut or damaged. May he cut corresponding in position to those in the body; disarrangement, tears and loss of buttons 16. Circumstantial evidence: Quiet place, such as bedroom or locked bath-room; usually stands in front of a mirror in order to direct the hand better; suicidal note or farewell letter may be found.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Opium To obtain the silver it needed to trade for tea with China, the East India Company smuggled opium from India. Opium was illegal in China, but nevertheless in demand. By 1839, East India Company's sale of opium to China paid for the entire tea trade.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Early in the 18th century the Portuguese found that they could import opium from India and sell it in China at a considerable profit. By 1773 the British had discovered the trade, and that year they became the leading suppliers of the Chinese market. The British East India Company established a monopoly on opium cultivation in the Indian province of Bengal, where they developed a method of growing opium poppies cheaply and abundantly. Other Western countries also joined in the trade, including the United States, which dealt in Turkish as well as Indian opium. Britain and other European countries undertook the opium trade because of their chronic trade imbalance with China. There was tremendous demand in Europe for Chinese tea, silks, and porcelain pottery, but there was correspondingly little demand in China for Europe\u2019s manufactured goods and other trade items. Consequently, Europeans had to pay for Chinese products with gold or silver. The opium trade, which created a steady demand among Chinese addicts for opium imported by the West, solved this chronic trade imbalance. The East India Company did not carry the opium itself. Because of the Chinese ban, the company farmed it out to \u201ccountry traders\u201d\u2014i.e., private traders who were licensed by the company to take goods from India to China. The country traders sold the opium to smugglers along the Chinese coast. The gold and silver the traders received from those sales were then turned over to the East India Company. In China the company used the gold and silver it received to purchase goods that could be sold profitably in England. The amount of opium imported into China increased from about 200 chests annually in 1729 to roughly 1,000 chests in 1767 and then to about 10,000 per year between 1820 and 1830. The weight of each chest varied somewhat\u2014depending on point of origin\u2014but averaged approximately 140 pounds (63.5 kg). By 1838 the amount had grown to some 40,000 chests imported into China annually. The balance of payments for the first time began to run against China and in favor of Britain. Meanwhile, a network of opium distribution had formed throughout China, often with the connivance of corrupt officials. Levels of opium addiction grew so high that it began to affect the imperial troops and the official classes. By 1906, the importance of opium in the West\u2019s trade with China had declined, and the Qing government was able to begin to regulate the importation and consumption of the drug. In 1907 China signed the Ten Years\u2019 Agreement with India, whereby China agreed to forbid native cultivation and consumption of opium on the understanding that the export of Indian opium would decline in proportion and cease completely in 10 years. The trade was thus almost completely stopped by 1917.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Narcotics drugs and psychotropic substances Act 1985 It was amended in 1989 and 2001 and repeals three acts Opium act 1857 Opium act 1878 Dangerous drugs act 1930 Narcotic drugs - cocoa leaf , cannabis , opium , poppy straw and includes all manufactured drugs Psychotropic substances ( eg., LSD , amphetamines , tranquilizers , barbiturates , benzodiazepines , ketamine etc.,)</p>\n<p></p>",
