Pathology: Usually the epithelium from 'surface of tympanic membrane migrates onto the posterior meatal wall. If there is failure of this migration or any kind of obstruction to migration caused by wax results in accumulation of the epithelial plug in the deep meatus. Clinical Features Usually patient presents with ear pain, hearing loss, ear discharge or tinnitus. Signs On examination the ear canal is filled with a pearly white mass of keratin material. Removal of this mass may result in widening of bony meatus with ulceration and granuloma. Treatment Removal of keratotic mass by syringing or instrumentation. Treatment. Keratotic mass is removed either by syringing or instrumentation.</p>\n<p></p>",

Sign and symptoms may vary from mild to severe. They usually start two to six days after exposure. Symptoms often come on fairly gradually, beginning with a sore throat and fever. In severe cases, a grey or white patch develops in the throat. This can block the airway and create a barking cough as in croup. The neck may swell in part due to enlarged lymph nodes. Sign & Symptoms The symptoms of diphtheria usually begin two to seven days after infection. Symptoms of diphtheria include fever of 38 \u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F) or above, chills, fatigue, bluish skin coloration (cyanosis), sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, foul-smelling and blood stained nasal discharge, and lymphadenopathy. Children most commonly affected. Oropharynx commonly involved. Larynx and Nasal cavity can be affected. In the oropharynx, a greyish white membrane forms over tonsil and spreads to soft palate and posterior pharyngeal wall. It is quite tenacious and causes bleeding when removed. Cervical lymph nodes involvement giving bull neck. Patient ill, toxemic, fever seldom rise above 38\u00b0c Complications Exotoxin toxic to heart and nerves can cause myocarditis, cardiac arrhythmia and acute circulatory failure. Neurological involvement includes paralysis of soft palate, diaphragm, and ocular muscles</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A- Acute membranous tonsillitis. It is a stage ahead of acute follicular tonsillitis when exudation from the crypts coalesces to form a membrane on the surface of tonsil. OPTION B- In follicular tonsillitis Infection spreads into the crypts which become filled with purulent material, presenting at the openings of crypts as yellowish spots. OPTION D- Aphthous ulcer may involve any part of oral cavity or oropharynx. Sometimes, it is solitary and may involve the tonsil and pillars. It may be small or quite large and alarming. It is very painful.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Treatment Dose of anti-toxin < 48 hr or if membrane limited: 20,000 to 40,000 units >48 hr or extensive membrane: 80k to 120k Antibiotic: benzyl penicillin or erythromycin</p>\n<p></p>",

(Epley Repositioning Maneuver for BPPV )</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>BPPV - benign paroxysmal positional vertigo It is a manoeuvre done to reposition the otoconal debris from the posterior semicircular canal back into the utricle, seen in BPPV. BPPV mostly involves posterior semicircular canal, can also be associated with history of head trauma and ear infection. The vertigo is fatiguable on assuming the same position but can be induced again after period of rest. The manoeuvre consists of five positions (Figure above): Position 1. With the head turned 45\u00b0, the patient is made to lie down in head-hanging position (Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre). It will cause vertigo and nystagmus. Wait till vertigo and nystagmus subside. Position 2. Head is now turned so that affected ear is facing up at a 90\u00b0 rotation. Position 3. The whole body and head are now rotated away from the affected ear to a lateral recumbent position in a 90\u00b0-rotation face-down position. Position 4. Patient is now brought to a sitting position with head still turned to the unaffected side by 45\u00b0. Position 5. The head is now turned forward and chin brought down 20\u00b0.</p>\n<p></p>",
