Optimal cytoreduction implies that tumor nodules no larger than 1 cm in diameter are left behind and survival improves as the amount of residual diseases decreases. Primary cytoreductive surgery, or debulking is central in the treatment of advanced disease because maximal cytoreduction is one of the most powerful predictors of survival in patients with advanced cancer . The determination of residual disease does not include the total volume of tumor cells left behind but rather the diameter of the largest single residual nodule. The mechanism by which primary cytoreductive surgery is felt to improve outcomes: First, surgery removes large volumes of chemoresistant tumor cell clones . Second, the excision of necrotic tissue improves drug delivery to remaining well-vascularized cells. Third, small residual tumor implants should be faster growing and therefore more susceptible to chemotherapy . Fourth, smaller cancer cell populations should require fewer chemotherapy cycles, which lowers the chances of chemoresistance. Finally, the removal of bulky disease potentially enhances the immune system .</p>\n<p></p>",

Epithelial Tumors Derived from the ovarian surface epithelium. Epithelial tumors comprise 50-60% of all ovarian tumors but malignant epithelial tumors comprise 90% of all ovarian cancers. Varieties of epithelial cell tumors Serous (histology resembles the lining of fallopian tubes) Mucinous (histology resembles endocervical epithelium) Endometrioid (histology resembles endometrial lining) Clear cell (histology resembles vaginal mucosa) Transitional cell (Brenners' - histology resembles bladder) Important Points to Remember: In Epithelial Tumors Malignant epithelial tumors include both cystic and solid types These are bilateral in 50 percent of cases Cystic type is more common than the solid These may arise de novo as malignant or more commonly, they result from malignant changes of benign cystic tumors. Serous. The serous histologic subtype resembles cells of the fallopian tube and is the most common, accounting for over 50% of all malignant ovarian tumors. Approximately one-third are malignant, one-sixth are LMP, and half are benign. The mean age of patients at diagnosis is 57 years. Psammoma bodies are present in 25%. Mucinous tumors - lined by cells that resemble the cells of the endocervical glands. Primary ovarian mucinous tumors account for 3% to 4% of epithelial tumors.

Endometrioid tumors resemble the histology of the endometrium. Most of them are malignant; 20% may be LMP. Associated with endometrial cancer, and endometriosis. Endometrioid tumors have a better prognosis because of their early stage at diagnosis. Clear cell.

The pelvic nodes may be involved through peritoneal permeation into the subperitoneal lymphatics. The left supraclavicular nodes are enlarged due to obstruction of the efferent lymphatic channel of the nodes by the tumor emboli, as it enters the thoracic duct just prior to its drainage into the left subclavian vein. Lateral lymphatic spread through the broad ligament to the pelvic nodes may occur. Retrograde lymphatic spread in advanced disease may occur to the inguinal nodes through the round ligament . Transcoelomic: Implantation of malignant cells Occurs by: Direct exfoliation of cells as in papillary cyst adenocarcinoma. Penetration of tumor capsule. Rupture of the capsule Direct : After the capsule is broken, the spread occurs directly to the adjacent organs such as tubes, broad ligament, intestines, omentum, and uterus.

If CA 125 levels decrease a fter treatment - It indicates the response to treatment. If CA 125 levels increase after treatment - It indicates relapse after treatment. an elevated Ca 125 level predicts persistent disease but CA 125 is not sensitive enough to exclude subclinical disease in many patients. Follow-up in patients of ovarian cancer is done by physical and pelvic examination along with an estimation of CA 125 levels. Patient is advised to visit every 3\u20134 months for the first 2 years and then 6 monthly for 5 years. Clinical examination and CA 125 together can detect 90% of recurrences . Radiological procedures are not required in all cases. But when CA 125 is elevated and we have to do PET, a CT scan cannot distinguish between a relapsed tumor and fibrosis whereas a PET scan will exactly demonstrate whether it is a relapsed tumor or a fibrosis . (In a patient treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy fibrosis is common. It can present as a mass so it is essential to differentiate between relapsed tumor and fibrosis.)</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Oophorectomy in 2nd Trimester Patient is presenting in the first trimester with ovarian Mass. In general, the management of ovarian mass in pregnancy is similar to management in non-pregnant females for uncomplicated cases. The principle of treatment in the case of ovarian tumors is to remove the tumor as soon as the diagnosis is made. But this principle should not be followed in the first trimester . Surgery in the first trimester is best avoided , as during surgery a corpus luteal cyst or ovary might be removed which will be detrimental to the pregnancy , and may end up in a miscarriage. Therefore, all such cases should be operated on (ovariotomy/cystectomy ) in the second trimester. Therefore, the best time of elective operation for an ovarian tumor in pregnancy is between 14 to 18 weeks , as the chances of abortion are less and access to the pedicle is easy.</p>\n<p></p>",
