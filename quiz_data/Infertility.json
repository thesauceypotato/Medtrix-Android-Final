The amino acid sequence of the human LH and CG \u03b2-subunits demonstrates approximately 80-percent similarity.

Their \u03b2-subunits have 80% homology : This is the correct answer. Both LH and hCG are glycoprotein hormones consisting of alpha and beta subunits. While the alpha subunits are nearly identical between these hormones, it's the beta subunits that confer their unique biological activities. The \u03b2-subunits of LH and hCG share about 80% homology, meaning they are structurally similar but not identical. This significant degree of similarity in their \u03b2-subunits is what leads to their similar biological activities.</li><li>\u2022 Option A.</li><li>\u2022 Their \u03b2-subunits have 80% homology</li><li>\u2022 Option B. They have nearly homologous \u03b1-subunits : This statement is true but not the reason for their similar biological activity. The \u03b1-subunits of LH and hCG, as well as other glycoprotein hormones like follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), are indeed nearly identical.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. They have nearly homologous \u03b1-subunits</li><li>\u2022 They have nearly homologous \u03b1-subunits</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

They are converted to the same amino acid sequence peripherally : This is also not correct. LH and hCG are secreted in their active forms and do not undergo conversion to a common amino acid sequence in the periphery. They exert their effects through interactions with specific receptors on target cells.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.</li><li>\u2022 They are converted to the same amino acid sequence peripherally</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Williams Gynecology page 335, 3 rd edition</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Williams Gynecology page 335, 3 rd edition</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

This test requires that a woman\u2019s morning oral temperature be graphically charted Oral temperatures are usually 97.0\u00b0 to 98.0\u00b0F during the follicular phase. A postovulatory rise in progesterone levels increases basal temperature by approximately 0.4\u00b0 to 0.8\u00b0F. This biphasic temperature pattern is strongly predictive of ovulation.

Abnormal luteal function may occur as the result of several medical conditions. True isolated LPD implies an underlying pathologic abnormality of the luteal phase in the absence of an identifiable disease process negatively affecting normal LH support of the corpus luteum. No diagnostic test for LPD has proven to be reliable in the clinical setting or in differentiating fertile from infertile women.

Laparoscopic Evaluation : Laparoscopy is considered the gold standard for tubal evaluation. It's a minimally invasive surgical procedure that provides a direct view of the pelvic organs, including the fallopian tubes. Laparoscopy not only allows for the assessment of tubal patency (often combined with chromopertubation, where a dye is passed through the tubes) but also enables visualization of the outer aspects of the tubes and the detection of other pelvic pathologies like endometriosis, adhesions, or fibroids that might affect tubal function. Its main limitation is that it's an invasive procedure requiring anesthesia.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.</li><li>\u2022 Laparoscopic Evaluation</li><li>\u2022 Option C . Saline Infusion Sonography (SIS) : SIS involves the infusion of saline into the uterine cavity during ultrasound examination.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) : MRI can provide detailed images of the pelvic organs, including the uterus and fallopian tubes, without using ionizing radiation.

Anti-M\u00fcllerian Hormone (AMH) : AMH is a hormone produced by the granulosa cells of small ovarian follicles.

Day 2 FSH : This test measures the level of FSH in a woman's blood on the second day of her menstrual cycle. FSH is a hormone that stimulates the ovaries to produce eggs.

Day 15 Antral Follicle Count (Correct Answer): This is not a standard test for ovarian reserve. The antral follicle count (AFC) is typically performed much earlier in the menstrual cycle, generally on day 2-5. The AFC involves counting the number of antral follicles (small follicles) in the ovaries using ultrasound, which can give an estimate of the remaining egg supply. Performing this count on day 15 would not be standard practice, as this is typically after ovulation has occurred, making it less relevant for assessing ovarian reserve.</li><li>\u2022 Option D</li><li>\u2022 Day 15 Antral Follicle Count</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Page 437, Williams Gynecology 3 rd edition</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Page 437, Williams Gynecology 3 rd edition</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Surgical therapy is preferred over medical therapy : This is generally not true. Medical therapy, typically with dopamine agonists like bromocriptine or cabergoline, is the first-line treatment for hyperprolactinemia, including that caused by micro-prolactinomas. These medications are effective in reducing prolactin levels and often lead to tumor shrinkage. Surgical therapy is usually reserved for cases where medical therapy is ineffective or not tolerated.</li><li>\u2022 Option A.</li><li>\u2022 Surgical therapy is preferred over medical therapy</li><li>\u2022 Option B. During pregnancy, cabergoline is preferred over bromocriptine : Actually, bromocriptine is generally preferred over cabergoline during pregnancy.

Clomiphene citrate may be ineffective for ovulation induction (Correct Answer): This is true. Clomiphene citrate is an ovulation induction agent that works by blocking estrogen receptors, leading to an increase in the release of FSH and LH. However, in the presence of elevated prolactin levels, as seen in hyperprolactinemia, the effectiveness of clomiphene may be diminished. Therefore, normalizing prolactin levels with dopamine agonists is often necessary before or in conjunction with using clomiphene.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.</li><li>\u2022 Clomiphene citrate may be ineffective for ovulation induction</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Dopamine-agonist therapy should be increased once pregnancy is achieved : This is not typically recommended. In fact, dopamine agonist therapy is often discontinued once pregnancy is confirmed in women with micro-prolactinomas. This is because the risk of tumor growth during pregnancy is low, and the safety of continued use of these drugs during pregnancy is not fully established.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.</li><li>\u2022 Dopamine-agonist therapy should be increased once pregnancy is achieved</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective</li><li>\u27a4 First-line treatment of hyper-prolactinemia with a mico-adenoma typically involves medical therapy with dopamine agonists, which are effective in lowering prolactin levels and can restore ovulatory function.</li><li>\u27a4 First-line treatment of hyper-prolactinemia with a mico-adenoma typically involves medical therapy with dopamine agonists, which are effective in lowering prolactin levels and can restore ovulatory function.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Page 450, Williams Gynecology 3 rd edition</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Page 450, Williams Gynecology 3 rd edition</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
