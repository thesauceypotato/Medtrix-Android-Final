      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Vossius ring Vossius ring is a well-circumscribed complete or incomplete ring of pigment deposition on the anterior lens capsule surface , usually as a result of significant blunt eye trauma. It is asymptomatic and generally will improve or resolve with time. It is a result of compression of the pigmented posterior iris epithelial cells and/or pupillary ruff against the anterior lens capsule with abrupt blunt force to the eye. Rupture of the cells causes deposition of a circular line of melanin pigment on the lens capsule. The ring of pigment is generally the same diameter as the undilated pupil. Uveitis is another well-known cause of pigment deposition on the lens surface. Intraocular inflammation can result in formation of posterior synechiae. With resolution of inflammation or pharmacologic mydriasis , the synechiae can leave patchy clumps and fragments of pigment on the anterior lens capsule. Uveitis can be distinguished from the Vossius ring based on history and presence of other ocular signs of inflammation including:- cell and flare in the anterior chamber, hypopyon, keratic precipitates, presence of systemic inflammatory disease, etc. KF rings are caused by deposition of excess copper on the inner surface of the peripheral cornea in the Descemet membrane , resulting from iron deposition in basal epithelial cells , in the form of hemosiderin . They are usually yellowish to dark-brown, and may be complete or broken . The rings are best seen using a slit lamp under a cobalt blue filter. A Weiss ring is a much larger, ring-shaped floater that is created by a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) from around the optic nerve head.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Blunt Trauma Of The Eye:- LENS VOSSIUS RING : It is a circular ring of brown pigment seen on the anterior capsule It occurs due to striking of contracted pupillary margin against the lens.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Parietal lobe The parietal lobe is behind the frontal lobe , separated by the central sulcus. Areas in the parietal lobe are responsible for:- integrating sensory information, including touch, temperature, pressure, two-point discrimination, pain and hand-eye coordination. The primary somatosensory cortex , located in the post rolandic area (postcentral gyrus) in the anterior parietal lobes , integrates somesthetic stimuli for recognition and recall of form, texture, and weight. Areas posterolateral to the postcentral gyrus generate visual-spatial relationships and integrate these perceptions with other sensations to create awareness of trajectories of moving objects. Parts of the MID parietal lobe of the dominant hemisphere are involved in abilities such as:- calculation, writing, left-right orientation, and finger recognition. The nondominant parietal lobe integrates the contralateral side of the body with its environment, enabling people to be aware of this environmental space, and is important for abilities such as drawing. Acute injury to the nondominant parietal lobe may cause neglect of the contralateral side (usually the left), resulting in decreased awareness of that part of the body , its environment , and any associated injury to that side ( anosognosia ).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Lesions in the angular gyrus can cause:- deficits in writing, calculating, left-right disorientation, and finger-naming (Gerstmann syndrome)</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The frontal lobe is generally where higher executive functions including:- emotional regulation, planning, reasoning and problem solving occur. This is why in frontotemporal dementia , personality changes are often the first signs of the disease. The temporal lobe contains regions dedicated to processing sensory information, particularly important for hearing, recognizing language, and forming memories. The occipital lobe is the major visual processing centre in the brain. The primary visual cortex , also known as V1 , receives visual information from the eyes, which is related to several secondary visual processing areas, which interpret depth, distance, location and the identity of seen objects.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Diplopia Charting vs Hess Chart: Diplopia Charting is the record of separation of the diplopic or double images in the nine positions of gaze and is especially important in patients who are bedridden , have torsional diplopia or Hess chart plotting is not possible. It can be plotted in patients who cooperate and can appreciate the double vision and with incomitant or comitant deviation. The light is carried to both eyes and tested with all positions of gaze. In the direction of the action of the paralyzed muscle , the double vision or the separation would be greatest because of the under action of the muscle and overaction of the antagonist muscle and yoke muscle. HESS Charting:- It aids in the diagnosis of ocular motility defects by measuring the deviation and the amount of underaction and overaction of muscles . It is a repeatable and reliable record of the condition and is, therefore, a good way to show improvement or deterioration of the condition . The principle is the foveal projection. The chart is plotted based on Hering\u2019s and Sherrington\u2019s law of innervation . The dissociation of two eyes is by the means of colors or mirrors (as in Less screen).

Infected women frequently transmit C. trachomatis infection to their infants during birth. Vaginal delivery is the usual route of transmission of C. trachomatis from infected mother to infant, as the eyes are coated with chlamydia as the baby passes down the birth canal. Maternally-acquired infection with C. trachomatis is the commonest cause of neonatal conjunctivitis in industrially developed countries and it is a significant cause of this condition in the developing world . Conjunctivitis develops between 5-14 days after delivery, usually in one eye but affecting the other after 2-7 days. Oedema and erythema of the eyelids is common , along with an eye discharge that may be watery initially, but becoming purulent later. Although chlamydia conjunctivitis is usually mild , infection of the hair follicles will increase the amount of discharge and prolong the period of infection. The most serious complication of neonatal chlamydia infection is pneumonia caused by nasopharyngeal C. trachomatis infection or aspiration of infected genital secretions during delivery.
