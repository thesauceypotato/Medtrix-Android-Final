Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP), also known as ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP), comprises a group of chronic autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering diseases. Diagnosis is principally clinical, but a biopsy of the mucous membrane often shows supportive changes (linear antibody and complement BMZ deposition). Fine lines of subconjunctival fibrosis and shortening of the inferior Fornices are typical features of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. Symblepharon formation refers to adhesion between the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva and is seen in this disease. Dry eye occurs as a prominent feature due to the destruction of goblet cells and accessory lacrimal glands and occlusion of the main lacrimal ductules. Monitoring should include the measurement of forniceal depth and noting the position of adhesions.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP) Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid Previously sometimes referred to as benign mucous membrane pemphigoid , this is a rare but severe disease of unknown origin affecting both eyes . It generally affects those older than 50 years and is of insidious onset with remissions and exacerbations. There is a loss of hemidesmosomal attachment of the epithelium to the basement membrane. Symptoms: include foreign body sensation, redness, watering, and photophobia. Signs: Vesicles occur on the conjunctiva, but greyish-white membranous patches are commonly seen . Progressive cicatrization follows, eventually leading to essential shrinkage of the conjunctiva, formation of inferior symblepharon, shallowing of the inferior fornix, severe dry eye, superficial punctate keratopathy, entropion, trichiasis, pannus, keratinization and consequent opacification of the cornea . Similar lesions may be found in the nose, mouth, palate, pharynx, Oesophagus, anus, vagina, urethra, and, more rarely, on the skin. Investigations : The diagnosis is made by conjunctival biopsy for immunofluorescence staining and dermatological, otorhinolaryngological, and gastrointestinal specialist consultations. Management: Depending on the severity of involvement, treatment with artificial tears, protective moisture-retaining glasses, punctal occlusion, topical and systemic steroids, dapsone, immunosuppressive therapy, surgery by mucous membrane grafts and keratoprosthesis for end-stage corneal disease. Local treatment, such as transplantation of the mucous membrane, is disappointing, as is general treatment.

One of the manifestations of angular conjunctivitis is an eczematous condition of the surrounding skin varying in intensity from a slight scruffiness to a well-marked area of redness and maceration, associated with considerable itching and smarting. Moraxella species are involved in causing angular conjunctivitis Nasal tract of healthy people and the nasal discharge of patients with angular conjunctivitis act as the source of infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>ANGULAR BACTERIAL CONJUNCTIVITIS It is a type of chronic conjunctivitis characterized by mild-grade inflammation confined to the conjunctiva and lid margins near the angles (hence the name) associated with maceration of the surrounding skin. Etiology Causative organisms . Moraxella Axenfield (MA) is the commonest causative organism. MA bacilli are placed end to end, so the disease is also called 'Diplo bacillary conjunctivitis.' Rarely, staphylococci may also cause angular conjunctivitis. Source of infection is usually the nasal cavity. Mode of infection. Contaminated fingers or handkerchiefs transmit infection from the nasal cavity to the eyes. Pathology The causative organism, i.e., MA bacillus, produces a proteolytic enzyme that acts by macerating the epithelium. This proteolytic enzyme collects at the angles by the action of tears and thus macerates the epithelium of the conjunctiva, lid margin, and skin, the surrounding angles of the eye. Vascular and cellular responses follow the maceration in the form of mild-grade chronic inflammation. The skin may show eczematous changes. Clinical features Symptoms: Include Irritation, burning sensation, and feeling of discomfort in the eyes. History of collection of dirty-white foamy discharge at the angles. Redness in the angles of eyes. Signs: Include Hyperaemia of bulbar conjunctiva near the canthi. Hyperaemia of lid margins near the angles. Excoriation of the skin around the angles.

Differentiation between such malignant and benign lymphoid lesions presents a diagnostic challenge as the majority of patients with either lesion can present with the same constellation of signs and symptoms It exhibits a polyclonal proliferation and presents in three different histologic types: follicular, diffuse, and sheet-like.

However, BRLH is thought to result from a chronic inflammatory response of lymphoid cells to antigenic stimulation. The disorder displays a predilection for the male gender and the most common site of involvement is the nasal conjunctiva. Due to the clinical resemblance of BRLH to conjunctival lymphoma and the potential risk of malignant transformation, thorough examination and assessment of such lesions are warranted.

Steroids are not recommended in acute Conjunctivitis, otherwise infection may flare up and bacterial corneal ulcers may develop.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Treatment includes the following: Topical drugs : Control of infection is most effectively achieved by the use of antibiotic drops. Ideally, the appropriate drug should be chosen after tests of bacterial sensitivity have been undertaken. Clinically, one or other of the \u2018broad-spectrum\u2019 antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in a frequency of four to six times a day are prescribed empirically . Antibiotic ointment is applied by expressing a small quantity directly into the lower fornix and is smeared along the lids at bedtime or, in the case of children, as often as they are put to sleep. It prevents the lids from sticking together\u2014 a twofold benefit\u2014of preventing discharge from being retained and obviating pain on opening them. With control of the infection by antibiotics the pain,redness, discharge and other signs of inflammation startresolving. Topical steroid medication to hasten resolution should not be used in infectious conjunctivitis. After an attack of mucopurulent conjunctivitis, the conjunctiva generally returns to normal. If the case has been neglected and chronic inflammatory signs persist,treatment should be the same as that for chronic conjunctivitis. Systemic medications are rarely required. Oral analgesic anti-inflammatory medication and/or antibiotics are only indicated for systemic features such as pyrexia and sore throat in case of pharyngoconjunctival fever or if there is severe accompanying preseptal cellulitis Supportive management : The eyes should not be bandaged, as this prevents drainage of the secretion, but if there is any discomfort in bright light, a sunshade or dark goggles should be worn. Since the disease is contagious, care must be taken to prevent its spread. Thepatient must keep his hands clean , and no one else should be allowed to use his towel, handkerchief, pillow or other fomites.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Irrigation of the conjunctival sac with sterile lukewarm saline once or twice a day will help by removing the deleterious material. Option: C. Topical antibiotics : main treatment of acute Conjunctivitis. Broad spectrum antibiotics should be used. Chloramphenicol ( 1%) or gentamicin (0.3%). If a patient does not respond to these antibiotics the quinolone antibiotics drops such as Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, gatifloxacin may be used. Option: D. Dark goggles should be used to prevent photophobia.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Based on clinical presentation, the chief forms of infective conjunctivitis may be divided into two broad groups: Infectious or infective conjunctivitis Acute conjunctivitis (resolving in less than 4 weeks) may be further classified based on type of discharge (mucoid or mucopurulent), conjunctival reaction (follicular or papillary) or aetiology (bacterial,viral, chlamydial or fungal). Chronic conjunctivitis (of more than 4 weeks\u2019 duration) includes inflammatory conjunctivitis, angular conjunctivitis, some types of follicular conjunctivitis including trachoma and granulomatous conjunctivitis. Neonatal conjunctivitis or ophthalmia neonatorum includes a limited spectrum of acute conjunctivitis and is dealt with separately.</p>\n<p></p>",

Mode of Infection Corneal infection with Acanthamoeba results from direct corneal contact with any material or water contaminated with the organism . Risk factors of contamination : Contact lens wearers using homemade saline (from contaminated tap water and saline tablets) is the commonest situation recognised for acanthamoeba infection in Western countries. Trauma associated with contaminated matter such as vegetable matter, sail water diving, and windblown contaminants. and hot tub use forms non-contact lens-related situations.

Acanthamoeba keratitis can also occur as an opportunistic infection in patients with herpetic keratitis, bacterial keratitis, bullous keratopathy, and neuroparalytic keratitis. Clinical features: Signs: Gradual worsening keratitis Symptoms: These vary from asymptomatic to foreign body sensation , mild pain to severe pain (out of proportion to the degree of inflammation due to perineural invasion ) , watering, photophobia , blepharospasm, and blurred vision . Epithelial lesions: epithelial roughening and irregularities , Epithelial ridges , Radial keratoneuritis, reported in 50% of cases, seems to be a pathognomonic early sign; pseudo dendrites formation occurs, and at this stage, it is commonly mistaken for herpes simplex keratitis.

Laboratory diagnosis : Corneal scrapings may be helpful in some cases, as under Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is reliable in experienced hands for recognizing Acanthamoeba cysts. Calcofluor white stain is a fluorescent brightener that stains the cysts of Acanthamoeba bright apple green under a fluorescence microscope. Lactophenol-stained cotton film is also useful for demonstrating acanthamoeba cysts in the corneal scrapings. Culture on non-nutrient agar (E. coli-enriched ) may show trophozoites within 48 hours, which gradually turn into cysts. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amoebic DNA is reported to be useful.
