The presence of any of the following indicates life-threatening asthma. Cyanosis, silent chest, poor respiratory efforts, exhaustion or fatigue, altered sensorium, PEFR<30% of predicted, and oxygen saturation <90%. Such patients should immediately receive oxygen by mask or hood. An injection of terbutaline or adrenaline is given subcutaneously, inhalation of salbutamol or terbutaline and ipratropium is started, an injection of hydrocortisone (5 mg/kg) is given and arrangements are made to transfer the patient to an intensive care unit (ICU) preferably with an accompanying physician. If the patient shows improvement, the salbutamol/ terbutaline inhalation is continued every 20-30 minutes, and hydrocortisone (3-5 mg/kg) is continued every 6-8 hours till the patient starts accepting orally. If the patient does not improve or deteriorate a slow IV infusion of magnesium sulfate (SO mg/kg) or a loading dose of theophylline is given. If there is no improvement with this management, the patient is prepared for mechanical ventilation. Patients should also be screened for causes of poor response such as acidosis, pneumothorax, electrolyte imbalance and infection, and treated accordingly.</p>\n<p></p>",
