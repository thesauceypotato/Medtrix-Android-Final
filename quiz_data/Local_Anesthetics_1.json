      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All are correct The cardiotoxicity of bupivacaine is largely contributed to its R isomer. Levobupivacaine and ropivacaine which only have an S isomer are obviously less cardiotoxic. Ropivacaine is less cardiotoxic than levobupivacaine because of other chemical changese., the butyl group is substituted with the propyl group. Ropivacaine and Levobupivacaine are less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine however still more cardiotoxic than lignocaine and prilocaine</p>\n<p></p>",
