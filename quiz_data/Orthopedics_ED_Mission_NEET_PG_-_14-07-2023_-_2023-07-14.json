The aggravating factor was prolonged sitting. The relieving factors included stretching, walking and getting up from sitting. He reported taking no medications or supplements.

Negative tests included right-sided SLR, bilateral Bowstring\u2019s Sign, Thomas test, Patrick/Faber/Distraction test, Thigh thrust test, Gaenslen\u2019s test, Ober\u2019s test, postero-anterior and side SI compression, Ely\u2019s test, Hibb\u2019s test, Yeoman\u2019s test, and Spring/joint mobility tests.
