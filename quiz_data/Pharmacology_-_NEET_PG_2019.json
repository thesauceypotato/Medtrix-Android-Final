If the patient has myasthenia gravis, an improvement in muscle strength lasting for about 5 minutes usually observed. In case edrophonium is not available, the test can be performed with 1.5 mg i.v. neostigmine. Atropine pretreatment may be given to block the muscarinic effects of neostigmine. Edrophonium test is used to distinguish between Myasthenic crisis of autoimmune Myasthenia Gravis and Cholinergic crisis. It is a short acting reversible non-carbamate Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (indirectly acting cholinomimetic). It is based on the scientific rationale that muscular weakness of myasthenic crisis (caused by inadequate cholinergic stimulation) dramatically improves on administration of Edrophonium. In Cholinergic crisis - caused by overtreatment with anti cholinesterases-s resulting in muscle weakness by induction of persistent depolarization, further administration of Edrophonium causes drastic worsening of muscle weakness.</p>\n<p></p>",

It acts by inhibiting influenza virus neuraminidase enzyme which is needed for release of progeny virions from the infected cell. Spread of the virus in the body is thus checked. Some oseltamivir-resistant strains remain susceptible to zanamivir and vice versa. Other Neuraminidase inhibitor recommended for the same purpose is Zanamivir - available for inhalation in patients over 5 years of age. Both these drugs are used with a risk benefit approach in pregnant women. Oseltamivir is indicated both for prophylaxis as well as treatment of influenza A, swine flu, bird flu and influenza B. Started at the onset of symptoms, it is the most effective drug; reduces the severity, duration and complications of the illness.
