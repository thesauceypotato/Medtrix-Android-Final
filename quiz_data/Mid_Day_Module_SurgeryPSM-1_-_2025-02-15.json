This minimally invasive approach can effectively manage a bile leak, which is a recognized complication after gallbladder surgery. Further diagnostic and therapeutic measures, such as ERCP, MRCP, or surgical intervention, depend on the clinical evolution and findings after the initial drainage.</li><li>\u27a4 fever and right hypochondrial pain post-cholecystectomy,</li><li>\u27a4 fluid collection on ultrasound</li><li>\u27a4 initial step should be ultrasound-guided drainage</li><li>\u27a4 Serious complications after cholecystectomy fall into two major areas: access complications and bile duct injuries. The latter are rare, occurring in approximately 0.5% following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In the main, biliary injury results from poor dissection and a failure to define the surgical anatomy adequately. The first step following resuscitation and administration of appropriate antibiotics is to undertake urgent USG. This will demonstrate whether there is intra- or extrahepatic ductal dilatation. If a fluid collection is present in the subhepatic space, drainage catheters may be required. These can be inserted under radiological control or, if this expertise is not available, at open operation. The anatomy may need to be defined by MRCP or ERCP. The latter is undertaken when therapeutic maneuver are planned, such as the removal of an obstructing stone or the insertion of a stent across a biliary leak. Small biliary leaks will usually resolve spontaneously, especially if there is no distal obstruction. If the CBD is damaged, the patient should be referred to an appropriate expert for reconstruction.</li><li>\u27a4 Serious complications after cholecystectomy fall into two major areas: access complications and bile duct injuries.
