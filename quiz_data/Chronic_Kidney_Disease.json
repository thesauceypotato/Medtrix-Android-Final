Hypotension during dialysis can be frequently prevented by careful evaluation of the dry weight and by ultrafiltration modelling Excessive rapid fluid removal greater than 13 millilitres per kg per hour should be avoided Additional manoeuvres to prevent intra-dialytic hypotension include the performance of sequential ultrafiltration followed by dialysis The management of hypotension during dialysis consists of discontinuing ultrafiltration, administration of 100 to 250 ml of isotonic saline or 10 ml of 23% saturated hypertonic saline, or administration of salt-poor albumin</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

In a patient with end-stage renal disease aka chronic kidney disease, the absolute indication of hemodialysis is pericarditis This is because the pericarditis can cause haemorrhage at any time in the pericardial sac this will result in cardiac tamponade and will cause obstructive shock This is an emergency and critical situation Hence hemodialysis is an absolute indication of pericarditis in CKD</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Absolute indications for Hemodialysis Uremic Pericarditis/Pleuritis Uremic Encephalopathy</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
