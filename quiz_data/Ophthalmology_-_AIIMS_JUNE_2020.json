It consists of 5\u20136 layers of cells . The deepest (basal) layer is made up of columnar cells, next 2\u20133 layers of wing or umbrella cells and the most superficial two layers are made of flattened cells. Tight junctions between superficial epithelial cells prevent penetration of tear fluid into the stroma. Limbal epithelium. The basal epithelial cells of the limbal area constitute the limbal stem cells which amplify, proliferate, and differentiate into corneal epithelium . Damage to this area results in the invasion of conjunctival epithelium on to the cornea Bowman\u2019s membrane. This layer consists of a cellular mass of condensed collagen fibrils. It is about 12 mm in thickness and binds the corneal stroma anteriorly with the basement membrane of the epithelium . It is not a true elastic membrane but simply a condensed superficial part of the stroma. It shows considerable resistance to infection. But once destroyed, it is unable to regenerate and, therefore, heals by scarring. \u201cThe epithelial cells contribute to secretion of tear mucus and the microvilli of the apical epithelial cells increas e the surface for tear adherence.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Signs of Corneal Disease Superficial Punctate epithelial erosions Tiny , slightly depressed , epithelial defects which stain with fluorescein but not with rose Bengal PEE are nonspecific Punctate epithelial keratitis It is the hallmark of viral infections Swollen epithelial cells Visible unstained Stains with rose bengal Epithelial Oedema Sign of Endothelial decompensation Severe acute elevation of IOP Filaments Small comma shaped mucus strands lined with epithelium One end attached with epithelium Pannus Inflammatory or degenerative ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue from limbus</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>BLOOD SUPPLY TO CORNEA: In normal condition, cornea does not contain any blood vessels Anterior ciliary artery , a branch ophthalmic artery forms a vascular arcade in the limbal region and helps in corneal metabolism and wound repair by providing nourishment.

Shake the bottle if indicated on the label. If the bottle has been refrigerated , warm it between your hands to room temperature. Gently clean the eyelids if they are crusty with discharge by wiping the lid from the inner corner to the outer corner with the eye closed using a cotton ball dampened with warm water. Tilt back the head, or lie down , and look upward. Using the thumb and index finger, gently pinch and pull the lower eyelid downward to form a pocket. Place the eye drop or drops into the pouch formed in the lower lid, not directly into the eye. If an eye ointment is used, place a 1/4 inch line of ointment into the lower lid pouch. Close your eye gently for 1 to 3 minutes or as instructed by the doctor to allow the medication to be absorbed. If another drop of eye medication is needed, wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before administering the second eye drop. If you are told to use an eye drop and an eye ointment at the same time, use the eye drop first, wait a few minutes, and then use the ointment.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Horner\u2019s Pupil Horner syndrome: A key examination finding is that anisocoria is accentuated in dim light , since in contrast to a normal fellow pupil, the Horner pupil will dilate only very slowly; the dark-induced anisocoria diminishes with time spent in the dark environment. Pupillary constriction to light and near stimuli is normal. The pupil remains miotic even in the dark room in Horner\u2019s syndrome An Adie pupil (tonic pupil, Adie syndrome) is caused by denervation of the postganglionic parasympathetic supply to the sphincter pupillae and the ciliary muscle, and may follow a viral illness.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Argyll Robertson Pupil AR Pupils are small (miosis), irregular in outline and have light near dissociation. They react poorly to light but very well to near reflex. AR Pupils are usually bilateral and symmetrical. Vision grossly intact. Causes of Optic Neuritis:- Marcus Gunn pupil is seen in optic neuritis. It is also common in retrobulbar optic neuritis due to multiple sclerosis but only for 3-4 weeks. Infection (e.g. syphilis, Lyme disease, herpes zoster), Autoimmune disorders (e.g. lupus neurosarcoidosis, neuromyelitis optica), Inflammatory bowel disease, Drug induced (e.g.chloramphenicol, ethambutol, Isoniazid, streptomycin, quinine, penicillamine, Aminosalicylic acid, phenothiazine, phenylbutazone), Vitamin B12 deficiency Diabetes Mellitus</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Signs of Adie\u2019s pupil: Large , regular (irregularity sometimes reported) pupil . The direct light reflex is absent or sluggish. On slit lamp examination , vermiform movements of the pupillary border are typically seen. Constriction is also absent or sluggish in response to light stimulation of the fellow eye (consensual light reflex). The pupil responds slowly to near, following which re-dilatation is also slow. Accommodation may manifest similar tonicity, with slowed and impaired focusing for near and prolonged re-focusing in the distance. In long-standing cases the pupil may become small (\u2018little old Adie\u2019). Argyll Robertson pupils are caused by neurosyphilis , and have been attributed to a dorsal midbrain lesion that interrupts the pupillary light reflex pathway but spares the more ventral pupillary near reflex pathway \u2013 light\u2013near dissociation results. In dim light both pupils are small and may be irregular. In bright light neither pupil constricts, but on accommodation (near target) both constrict. The pupils do not dilate well in the dark, but cocaine induces mydriasis unless marked iris atrophy is present. A blind pupil is dilated and fixed.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>RSR The Park's Three-Step Test is used to isolate the paretic muscle in acquired vertical diplopia. The Park's Three-Step Test is not intended to be used for assessing horizontal diplopia, nor will it provide useful information in restrictive strabismus or neuromyopathic conditions . This test is most appropriate for neuroparalytic disorders . The Park's Three-Step Test works by observing the vertical deviation in primary gaze , left and right gaze, and right and left head tilt.

The second step is to determine whether the hypertropia increases on the right or left gaze. The third step is determination if the hypertropia increases upon left head tilt or right head tilt. Which eye is hyper deviated in primary gaze? If the left eye is the hyper deviated eye we know that the muscle that is failing is either responsible for pulling the left eye down or for pulling the right eye up. Our suspects in the right eye are the RSR or RIO. In the left eye it\u2019s the LSO or LIR. We can eliminate all others as possibilities. Is the vertical deviation greater in right gaze or left gaze? When we look in right gaze the muscles most responsible for the eyes' vertical position are the right rectus muscles and the left oblique muscles. Therefore our suspects are RSR, RIR, LSO, LIO. The other four can be eliminated. Is the vertical deviation greater with right head tilt or left head tilt? When the head is tilted to the right, the right eye needs to turn inward (incyclotorsion) and the left eye needs to turn outward (excyclotorsion). The muscles responsible for these movements are the RSR, RSO and the LIO, LIR. One of these could be malfunctioning. The other four can be eliminated.
