Enchondroma is the most common skeletal tumor of the hand. Enchondroma is a lesion which has got hyaline cartilage inside it, usually treated by curettage + Bone graft. They are most often solitary tumors. In rare cases, however, multiple tumors can appear as part of a condition such as Ollier\u2019s disease or Maffucci syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Ollier\u2019s disease: Multiple enchondromatoses with deformity & growth stunting (30-35 % malignancy risk) Maffucci syndrome: Multiple enchondromatoses with multiple hemangiomas (100% malignancy risk) + calcified superficial veins (phleboliths).

It is a blood filled cavity. The blood degradation product gives it a brown color, hence the name brown tumor. Brown tumor is a typical finding seen in case of PTH adenoma. High level of PTH \u2193 Increased stimulation of osteoblast \u2193 Increased release of RANK ligand \u2193 Increase osteoclast stimulation \u2193 Lysis \u2193 Formation of cysts(osteo-fibrosis-cystica) \u2193 Filled with blood degradation products-Brown Tumor</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Ollier disease is classified as Spranger type I.

Penile Urethra - The penile urethra is the longest segment (10 to 15 cm) and extends from the lower surface of the urogenital diaphragm to the urethral meatus in the glans penis. The orifices of the bulbomembranous urethral glands are located on the lateral surfaces of the proximal (bulbous) portion of the penile urethra. Option C. Bulbar Urethra - Bulbar (meaning \u201cbulb shaped\u201d) urethral stricture is an obstruction of urine flow through the urethra, which impedes the body's ability to pass urine. Option D. Spongy Urethra - The spongy urethra is the region that spans the corpus spongiosum of the penis. It is divided into the pendulous urethra and the bulbous (or bulbar) urethra. The pendulous urethra is invested in the corpus spongiosum of the penis in the pendulous portion of the penis.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

For this, thoracic movements during breathing are recorded as pressure changes in the surrounding air, which are converted subsequently into changes in the lung volume. This type of measurement only works in a closed set-up. One reason to perform body plethysmography could be to differentiate between restriction and emphysema, that is, chronic lung hyperinflation. Several plethysmographic techniques with different sensors have been used to measure changes in blood volume in a limb, including strain-gauge plethysmography (SGP), impedance plethysmography (IPG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and air plethysmography (APG). These tests rely on the fact that the lower extremity veins are not filled to maximum capacity when the patient is in the supine position . With positional changes or when outflow is occluded by a pressure cuff, the venous system can accommodate increased volume before reaching maximal venous capacitance. With subsequent rapid positional changes or release of an externally inflated pressure cuff, patients with normal outflow exhibit rapid emptying of their lower extremity veins. These tests now routinely use an occlusion cuff, which has increased standardization by avoiding active patient movement and positional changes. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), is a technique in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. It relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid solvent containing the sample mixture through a column filled with a solid adsorbent material . Each component in the sample interacts slightly differently with the adsorbent material, causing different flow rates for the different components and leading to the separation of the components as they flow out of the column. Medical use of HPLC can include drug analysis, but falls more closely under the category of nutrient analysis. While urine is the most common medium for analyzing drug concentrations, blood serum is the sample collected for most medical analyses with HPLC. Other methods of detection of molecules that are useful for clinical studies have been tested against HPLC, namely immunoassays.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In this assay, a standard TEG is run using patient's whole blood. Then, separate assays are run using the patient's blood with added AA or ADP. The contribution of fibrin to the MA is subtracted using a mathematical formula. This allows determination of the MA (AA) and MA (ADP), respectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

The non-contrast image (mask image) of the region is taken before injecting contrast material and therefore shows only anatomy, as well as any radiopaque foreign bodies (surgical clips, stents, etc.) as would a regular x-ray image.
