      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Galeazzi fracture-dislocation Galeazzi fracture is a distal third radial shaft fracture with an associated distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) injury . Diagnosis can be suspected with a distal radius fracture with the widening of the radioulnar joint on AP wrist radiographs and volar/dorsal subluxation of the radioulnar joint on lateral wrist radiographs.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>GALEAZZI FRACTURE-DISLOCATION This injury is the counterpart of the Monteggia fracture-dislocation. Here, there is a fracture of the lower third of the radius with dislocation or subluxation of the distal radio-ulnar joint. It commonly results from a fall on an out stretched hand. DISPLACEMENT The radius fracture is angulated medially and anteriorly (Fig-15.4). The distal radio-ulnar joint is disrupted, resulting in dorsal dislocation of the distal end of the ulna. DIAGNOSIS In an isolated fracture of the distal-half of the radius, the distal radio-ulnar joint must be carefully evaluated for subluxation or dislocation. TREATMENT Perfect reduction is essential for complete restora- tion of functions, particularly rotation of the fore- arm. It is difficult to achieve and maintain perfect reduction by conservative methods (except in children). Most adults require open reduction and internal fixation of the radius with a plate. The dislocated radio-ulnar joint may automatically fall back in place or may require open reduction. COMPLICATIONS Malunion occurs because of displacement of the fragment. It results in deformity and limitation of supination and pronation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For incorrect options:- < Option: B. Monteggia fracture-dislocations consist of a fracture of the ulnar shaft with concomitant dislocation of the radial head as the result of a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH). Option: C. Essex-Lopresti fracture- dislocation is characterized by a fracture of the radial head, dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint, and rupture of the interosseous membrane . Option: D. Barton fractures are intra-articular fractures of the distal radius . It may be dorsal or volar type.</p>\n<p></p>",
