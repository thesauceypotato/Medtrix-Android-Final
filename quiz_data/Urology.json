Medications: Some drugs, like anticoagulants and anti-inflammatory medications, can induce bleeding in the urinary tract. Trauma: Blunt/penetrating renal trauma Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH): In men, an enlarged prostate can cause irritation or blockage of the urinary tract and result in bleeding.

Urethral dilatation rarely cures stricture and most patients require repeated dilations. Direct visual internal urethrotomy (DVIU): Performed using an optical urethrotome . The stricture is incised under visual control using a cold knife passed through the sheath of a rigid urethrotome. Alternatively, a laser fiber (holmium/thulium) can be used. DVIU is indicated for short, non-traumatic bulbar strictures but should not be used in the penile urethra or the sphincter active membranous urethra. Urethroplasty . There are two types of urethroplasty: anastomotic and augmentation. Anastomotic urethroplasty is performed for bulbar urethral traumatic strictures where there is a gap in the urethra. This involves dissection of the two ends of the urethra, spatulation and anastomosis. Augmentation urethroplasty is performed for non-traumatic and long strictures. In this type of urethroplasty the structured segment of urethra is incised and augmented with a patch (graft).

This investigation can be performed in cases where fistula is suspected but cannot be identified on the investigations . Three numbered gauze swabs are placed into the vagina, with swab number 1 placed most proximally, swab number 2 in the middle and swab number 3 most distal in the vagina. A blue dye is then instilled into the bladder through a catheter, and the catheter removed. Blue staining of swab 1 or 2 suggests VVF whereas blue staining of swab 3 suggests a urethra- vaginal fistula or stress urinary incontinence. If swab 1 is wet but not stained blue, this suggests the presence of a ureterovaginal fistula.</li><li>\u27a4 \u2018Three-swab\u2019 test</li><li>\u27a4 performed in cases where fistula is suspected but cannot be identified on the investigations</li><li>\u27a4 Ref : Bailey and Love\u2019s short practice of surgery 28 th edition pg 1506</li><li>\u27a4 Ref</li><li>\u27a4 : Bailey and Love\u2019s short practice of surgery 28 th edition pg 1506</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
