HPVs are DNA Sites in the female genital tract that are susceptible to infection include areas of squamous epithelial trauma and repair, where the virus may access basal cells, and the immature metaplastic squamous cells that are present at the squamocolumnar junction of the cervix Here, the viruses make factors that interfere with host proteins that regulate cell proliferation.
