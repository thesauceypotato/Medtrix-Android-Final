      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>I, IV, V The correct answer is option B. Statement I- Usually affects young children but can occur at any age. It is usually rounded with a diameter of 2\u20134 cm. It increases in size with upper respiratory tract infection. Statement IV- Thyroglossal cysts can occur anywhere in the thyroid duct. It may contain the only functioning thyroid tissue in the body. Rarely carcinoma develops in the cyst. Statement V- Treatment is complete surgical excision, including the body of hyoid bone and core of tongue tissue around the tract in the suprahyoid tongue base to the foramen caecum (Sistrunk\u2019s operation). Statement I- Thyroglossal duct cyst presents as a cystic midline swelling. Statement VI - Simple excision of the cyst without removal of its tract leads to recurrence. Statement III- Sometimes it presents as a draining sinus if it has burst due to infection or has been surgically drained. Because of the attachment of the thyroglossal duct to the foramen caecum at the base of the tongue, it moves with tongue protrusion. So out of the given option combination, option B is the correct answer.</p>\n<p></p>",
