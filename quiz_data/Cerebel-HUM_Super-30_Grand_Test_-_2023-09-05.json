On examination, his temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), and his other vital signs are normal. His cheeks are notably red, almost as if they had been slapped. His pharynx is normal appearing, and the remainder of his head and neck exam is normal. On his extremities there is a fine, erythematous, maculopapular rash but no vesicles or petechiae. A rapid group A streptococcal antigen test done in the office is negative. Identify the organism likely cause of this illness and tell in which human cells does this virus cause lytic infections?",
