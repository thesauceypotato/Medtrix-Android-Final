Nickel is the most common metal cause of allergic contact dermatitis.

Features: Patches of dermatitis at sites of contact with metal objects Most commonly, the ears from earrings, Wrists from watches and bracelets, Neck from necklaces and their clasps, Central back and upper chest from bra components, Central abdomen from studs and zips in trousers, especially jeans, and Dorsa of the feet from shoe buckles.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Allergic contact dermatitis A Type IV hypersensitivity (delayed type) reaction occurs to a substance (allergen) in previously sensitised individuals by the same molecule.
