Persistent right anterior cardinal vein The anterior cardinal veins ( precardinal veins ) contribute to the formation of the internal jugular veins and together with the common cardinal vein form the superior vena cava. The anastomosis between the two anterior cardinal veins develops into the left brachiocephalic vein. The right anterior cardinal (precardinal) vein proximal to the right brachiocephalic vein forms the superior vena cava (SVC) with the common cardinal, and terminal/proximal segment of the posterior cardinal (postcardinal) vein. The more cranial portions of the bilateral anterior cardinal veins persist and form the internal jugular veins. During the course of their development and involution, the anterior cardinal veins form multiple normal permanent structures, as well as potentially some anomalous structures. Option C. Persistent left supra cardinal vein IVC duplication results from a persistent left supra cardinal vein. A double inferior vena cava occurs when the left Sacrocardinal vein fails to lose its connection with the left sub cardinal vein. The left common iliac vein may or may not be present, but the left gonadal vein remains normal. Option D. Persistent right umbilical vein A persistent right umbilical vein (PRUV) is an uncommon vascular anomaly often detected in utero. In a normal situation, the right umbilical vein begins to obliterate in the 4th week of gestation and disappears by the 7th week. With a PRUV, the right umbilical vein remains open, and the left umbilical vein usually obliterates. A PRUV may also be supernumerary.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Absence of the inferior vena cava aris es when the right sub cardinal vein fails to make its connection with the liver and shunts its blood directly into the right supra cardinal vein. Hence, the bloodstream from the caudal part of the bodyreaches the heart by way of the azygos vein and superior vena cava. The hepatic vein enters into the right atrium at the site of the inferior vena cava. Usually, this abnormality is associated with other heart malformations.</p>\n<p></p>",

They anastomose with the posterior cardinal veins inferiorly to form the common cardinal veins (ducts of Cuvier), which drain into the sinus venosus . At approximately 8 weeks of gestation, the left brachiocephalic vein forms from an anastomosis between the thymicothyroic veins and connects the left and right anterior cardinal veins. After this left-right connection forms, asymmetry develops when the caudal portion of the left anterior cardinal vein begins to involute, which redirects blood flow to the proximal right anterior cardinal vein, which persists to become the right-sided superior vena cava (SVC). The caudal portion of the left anterior cardinal artery forms the oblique ligament and vein of Marshall after involution. The more cranial portions of the bilateral anterior cardinal veins persist and form the internal jugular vein . During the course of their development and involution, the anterior cardinal veins form multiple normal permanent structures, as well as potentially some anomalous structures.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Inferior vena cava (IVC): It is the largest vein of the body and develops from six components.

Right supra cardinal\u2013sub cardinal anastomosis (3) Right sub cardinal vein between (i) the supra cardinal\u2013sub cardinal anastomosis and (ii) anas- tomotic channel connecting the right sub cardinal vein with right hepatocardiac channel. It is called the renal segment of the IVC (4). Anastomosing channel that connects the right sub cardinal vein to the right hepatocardiac channel (5). Right hepatocardiac channel forms terminal segment ( hepatic segment ) of the inferior vena cava that first opens into right horn of sinus venosus, and, after the right horn is absorbed in the right atrium, in the right atrium itself (6).
