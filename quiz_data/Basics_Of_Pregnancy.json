      "explanation": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u2022 Incorrect Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B (Do not waste the TT vaccine as it would anyhow be of no use in this pregnancy) Explanation: This is incorrect because even a single dose provides maternal protection and initiates the development of antibodies that can be transferred to the fetus, albeit possibly not to the optimal protective level for neonatal tetanus prevention if delivery is very soon. It is never a waste to provide beneficial vaccination.</li><li>\u2022 Option C (Given one dose of TT and explain that it will not be useful for this pregnancy) Explanation: Similar to option B, this is incorrect. The vaccine is useful for the mother's protection. While the full benefit for neonatal tetanus requires a completed series and sufficient time before delivery, it's misleading and discouraging to state it will be \"not useful\" for this pregnancy entirely, as some antibody transfer may occur.</li><li>\u2022 Option D (Give her anti-tetanus Immuno-globulin along with the TT vaccine) Explanation: Anti-tetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG) provides immediate, but temporary, passive immunity and is typically reserved for high-risk tetanus-prone wounds. It is not part of the routine antenatal immunization schedule for preventing neonatal tetanus. While TIG is given alongside TT for acute wound management, it is not the standard approach for a routine antenatal visit aiming to establish active immunity for the mother and passive immunity for the newborn</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
