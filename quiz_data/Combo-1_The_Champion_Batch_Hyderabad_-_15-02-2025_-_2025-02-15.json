In this mechanism, called tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF), an increase in NaCl concentration at the macula densa constricts the glomerular afferent arteriole and thus decreases the single-nephron GFR. Along with the myogenic response, TGF significantly contributes to renal autoregulation.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

D) 1, 2, and 4</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 Ventricular muscle fibers exhibit several unique properties that are crucial for their function:</li><li>\u2022 1. All or None Law : This principle states that a single muscle fiber will either contract fully or not at all in response to a stimulus. Ventricular muscle fibers act as a syncytium due to the presence of gap junctions made up of connexin proteins, which allows them to follow the all-or-none law. Thus, this property is true for ventricular muscle fibers.</li><li>\u2022 1. All or None Law</li><li>\u2022 2. Length-Tension Relation : The length-tension relationship in ventricular muscle fibers is a reflection of the Frank-Starling law, which states that the force of contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to its initial length (or end-diastolic volume, EDV). This relationship is crucial for adjusting cardiac output based on the volume of blood returning to the heart. Within physiological limits, an increase in the initial length of the muscle fiber increases the force of contraction.</li><li>\u2022 2. Length-Tension Relation</li><li>\u2022 4. Long Refractory Period : Ventricular muscle fibers have a long refractory period due to the extended plateau phase in their action potential. This long refractory period is crucial in preventing tetanus and ensuring that the heart muscle relaxes fully before the next contraction, maintaining efficient pumping action.</li><li>\u2022 4. Long Refractory Period</li><li>\u2022 Other Option:</li><li>\u2022 Other Option:</li><li>\u2022 3. Tetanus : Tetanus is a sustained muscle contraction that occurs when the muscle is stimulated at a high frequency. However, due to the long refractory period in ventricular muscle fibers, tetanus is not possible. The plateau phase (phase 2) of the cardiac action potential is prolonged, which ensures that the heart muscle cannot be re-stimulated before the previous contraction is complete. This prevents sustained contractions (tetanus), which would be detrimental to cardiac function.</li><li>\u2022 3. Tetanus</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Ventricular muscle fibers follow the all-or-none law, have a length-tension relationship (Frank-Starling law), and possess a long refractory period that prevents tetanus.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
