      "text": "A 58-year-old man comes to the OPD due to a one-month history of progressive dyspnoea, generalized weakness, fatigue, and palpitations. He also reports tingling and numbness in both lower limbs. His daughter adds that since his wife's death a year ago, the patient has not been taking care of himself. Blood pressure is 105/50 mm Hg and pulse is 104/ min. Cardiovascular examination shows a displaced apical impulse at the sixth intercostal space, a third heart sound, and high-volume, collapsing carotid pulses. Bilateral basal crackles, 2+ bilateral pedal edema, and mild hepatomegaly are also present. Neurologic examination shows decreased light touch and vibration sense in the feet, with decreased knee and ankle reflexes bilaterally. Laboratory evaluation shows normal blood counts. Deficiency of which of the following nutrients is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?",
