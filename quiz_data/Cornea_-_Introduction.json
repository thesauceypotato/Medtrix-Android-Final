The rings may be identified using slit-lamp examination or gonioscopy when not visible to the unaided eye. Kayser-Fleischer rings are observed in up to 90% of individuals with symptomatic Wilson disease and are almost invariably present in those with neurologic manifestations. Although Kayser-Fleischer rings are a useful diagnostic sign, they are no longer considered pathognomonic of Wilson's disease unless accompanied by neurologic manifestations. They may also be observed in patients with chronic cholestatic disorders, such as partial biliary atresia, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and cryptogenic cirrhosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

Nebular corneal opacity . It is a faint opacity that results due to superficial scars involving Bowman's layer and superficial stroma. A thin, diffuse nebula covering the pupillary area interferes more with vision than the localized leu coma away from the pupillary area. Further, the nebula produces more discomfort to patients due to blurred images owing to irregular astigmatism than the leucoma, which completely curbs the light rays. Macular corneal opacity . It is a semi-dense opacity produced when scarring involves about half the corneal stroma. Leucomatous corneal opacity (leucoma simplex) . It is a dense white opacity that results due to scarring of more than half of the stroma. Adherent leucoma. It results when healing occurs after the perforation of the cornea with the incarceration of the iris. Corneal facet . Sometimes, the corneal surface is depressed at the healing site (due to less fibrous tissue); such a scar is called a facet. Kerectasia . In this condition, corneal curvature is increased at the site of opacity (bulge due to weak scar). Anterior staphyloma . An ectasia of pseudocornea (the scar formed from organised exudates and fibrous tissue covered with epithelium) which results after total sloughing of the cornea, with the iris plastered behind it, is called anterior staphyloma.</p>\n<p></p>",

Loss/damage to the epithelium is termed an epithelial defect.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Epithelium: It is the outermost layer of the cornea and is composed of stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelial cells. It becomes continuous with the epithelium of the bulbar conjunctiva at the limbus. It consists of 5-6 layers of cells. The deepest (basal) layer is made up of columnar cells, the next 2-3 layers of wing or umbrella cells, and the most superficial two layers are made of flattened cells . Bowman's membrane . This layer consists of an acellular mass of condensed collagen fibrils Stroma (substantia propria). This layer is about 0.5 mm in thickness and constitutes most of the cornea (90% of the total thickness). It consists of collagen fibrils (type-I and type-V fibrillae intertwined with filaments of type-VI collagen) embedded in a hydrated matrix of proteoglycans (chondroitin sulphate and keratan sulphate) Pre- Descemet's membrane, also known as Dua's layer , was discovered in 2013 by Dr. Harminder Dua, an Indian ophthalmologist working in Great Britain. Located anterior to the Descemec's membrane, it is about 15 micrometer thick acellular structure that is very strong and impervious to air. Descemet's membrane (posterior elastic lamina) . The Descemet's membrane is a strong homogenous basement membrane of the corneal endothelium, which is separated from the stroma by the pre-Descemet's membrane. Endothelium .

Option: C. Inflammation in the cornea is visible as a greyish haze or loss of clarity. If accompanied by an outpouring of leucocytes, the appearance is more off-white or yellowish, and this hazy area as termed as an infiltration. Option: D.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>It is a relatively hydrated state The transparency of the cornea is due to its relatively dehydrated state . This relative state of dehydration is maintained by the integrity of the hydrophobic epithelium and endothelium, the endothelial pump, and the osmotic gradient because the aqueous and tears are relatively hypertonic. The main role of the endothelial cells is to limit the fluid intake of the cornea from the aqueous.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>\u201cCorneal transparency\u201d The corneal transparency is the result of: Anatomical factors such as: Corneal epithelium and tear film. Homogeneity of the refractive index throughout the epithelium. Peculiar arrangement of corneal lamellae (lattice theory of Maurice). Peculiar refractive index of corneal lamellae with variation less than 200 \u00b5m (Goldmann and Benedek theory). Avascularity of the cornea. Physiological factors keep the cornea in a relative state of dehydration (78% water content). These factors are: Barrier function of limiting layers (epithelium and endothelium). Endothelial pumps . The corneal endothelium is predominant in controlling fluid transport due to several enzyme systems: Na/K ATPase pump, Bicarbonate-dependent ATPase, and Na-H' pump, and is thus the most important factor in maintaining corneal dehydration. Evaporation from the corneal surface . Normal intraocular pressure (IOP) . Swelling pressure (SP) of the stroma counters the imbibition effect of intraocular pressure (IOP). Corneal crystallins , i.e., waler soluble proteins of keratocytes (transketolase and aldehyde dehydrogenase class lAl) also contribute to corneal transparency at the cellular level</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Uniform refractive index of all the layers is essential to maintain transparency of the cornea. Option: C. Uniform spacing of the collagen fibrils in the stroma: The collagen fibrils are separated by a distance that is less than the wavelength of light so that any irregularly refracted rays of light are eliminated by destructive interference. And thus, this is lattice formation. If there is an increase in separation of the stromal collagen or a disruption in their regular arrangement, such as an increase in tissue fluid, the cornea becomes opaque. Option: D. Absence of blood vessels and pigment is essential to maintain transparency of the cornea.</p>\n<p></p>",

It becomes continuous with the epithelium of the bulbar conjunctiva at the limbus. It consists of 5-6 layers of cells. The deepest (basal) layer is made up of columnar cells, the next 2-3 layers of wing or umbrella cells, and the most superficial two layers are made of flattened cells . Bowman's membrane . This layer consists of an acellular mass of condensed collagen fibrils Stroma (substantia propria). This layer is about 0.5 mm in thickness and constitutes most of the cornea (90% of the total thickness). It consists of collagen fibrils (type-I and type-V fibrillae intertwined with filaments of type-VI collagen) embedded in a hydrated matrix of proteoglycans (chondroitin sulphate and keratan sulphate) Pre- Descemet's membrane, also known as Dua's layer , was discovered in 2013 by Dr. Harminder Dua, an Indian ophthalmologist working in Great Britain. Located anterior to the Descemec's membrane, it is about 15 micrometer thick acellular structure that is very strong and impervious to air. Descemet's membrane (posterior elastic lamina) . The Descemet's membrane is a strong homogenous basement membrane of the corneal endothelium, which is separated from the stroma by the pre-Descemet's membrane. Endothelium . It consists of a single layer of flat polygonal (mainly hexagonal) epithelial cells (misnamed as the endothelium) which on slit-lamp biomicroscopy, appear as a mosaic.</p>\n<p></p>",
