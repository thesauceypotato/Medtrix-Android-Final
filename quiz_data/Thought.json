The words make sentences, but the sentences do not make sense. Option B: Circumstantiality is the Overinclusion of trivial or irrelevant details that impede the sense of getting to the point. Option D: Tangentiality is said when, in response to a question, the patient gives a reply that is appropriate to the general topic without actually answering the question . Example: Doctor: \"Have you had any trouble sleeping lately?\" Patient: \"I usually sleep in my bed, but now I'm sleeping on the sofa.\"</p>\n<p></p>",
