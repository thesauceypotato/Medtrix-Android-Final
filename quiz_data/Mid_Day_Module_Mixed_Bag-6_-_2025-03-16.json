A) Chronic Granulomatous Disease</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) necessary to kill certain bacteria and fungi. This condition is most commonly inherited in an X-linked recessive manner due to a defect in the CYBB gene , which encodes a component of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex.</li><li>\u2022 CYBB gene</li><li>\u2022 Patients with CGD typically present with recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, particularly affecting the skin, lungs, and lymph nodes. The dihydro-rhodamine (DHR) test, which measures the oxidative burst of neutrophils, is used to diagnose CGD. An abnormal DHR test indicates a defect in the NADPH oxidase enzyme , confirming the diagnosis of CGD.</li><li>\u2022 dihydro-rhodamine (DHR) test,</li><li>\u2022 defect in the NADPH oxidase enzyme</li><li>\u2022 Investigation \u2013 NBT and DHR 123 test (flow cytometry)</li><li>\u2022 TOC \u2013 Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; IFN gamma</li><li>\u2022 TOC \u2013</li><li>\u2022 Other Options</li><li>\u2022 Other Options</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) : SCID is characterized by a severe defect in both T- and B-lymphocyte systems.

Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Sialyl Lewis X defect : This results in leukocyte adhesion defect type 2 (LAD-2), which involves issues with leukocyte migration due to defective carbohydrate metabolism affecting leukocyte rolling.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Sialyl Lewis X defect</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Leukocyte Adhesion Defect (LAD) : LAD type 1 involves a defect in the CD18 gene affecting leukocyte adhesion and migration, leading to recurrent infections without pus formation and poor wound healing.

A) Intensity is inversely proportional to squared distance</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 This statement refers to the Inverse Square Law, which states that the intensity of radiation is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. This means that as the distance from the radiation source increases, the intensity of the radiation decreases exponentially. This law is fundamental in radiation physics and is crucial for understanding radiation exposure and protection.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Small blood vessels are most radioresistant: This is incorrect. Larger vessels are more radioresistant compared to smaller ones. The endothelial cells lining small vessels are more susceptible to radiation damage due to their relatively higher rate of proliferation.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Small blood vessels are most radioresistant:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Rapidly proliferating cells are most radioresistant: This is incorrect. Rapidly proliferating cells are the most radiosensitive. Cells that are dividing quickly, such as those in the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, and reproductive tissues, are more susceptible to radiation damage because radiation primarily affects DNA during cell division.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Rapidly proliferating cells are most radioresistant:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Small bowel is most radioresistant: This is incorrect. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including the small bowel, is among the most radiosensitive organ systems in the body. This high radiosensitivity is due to the rapid turnover of the epithelial cells lining the GI tract.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
