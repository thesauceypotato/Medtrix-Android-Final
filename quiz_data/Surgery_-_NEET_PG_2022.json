Approximately 5-10% of cases have an actual pathological lead point. Meckel's diverticulum and polyps are the most common lead points. Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura and cystic fibrosis can also be risk factors. Clinical Features: Sudden, short-duration, cyclic crampy abdominal pain Crying inconsolably with the knees drawn up during episodes Vomiting is almost universal Passage of blood mixed with mucus in stools (red currant jelly stool) Palpable abdominal mass (sausage-shaped) The feeling of emptiness in the right iliac fossa (Sign of Dance) Occult or gross blood in 60-90% of cases on rectal examination Apex may be palpable or even protrude from the anus in extensive intussusception Diagnosis: Ultrasound can show a kidney-shaped mass in the longitudinal view or a target sign in the transverse view.

Incidence: Occurs in 1 in 1000 live births with a male and left-sided predominance. It is the most common cause of severe antenatal Pathology : Commonly a disruption of circular muscle or collagen fibers in the proximal ureter results in an intrinsic narrowing near the renal pelvis. Extrinsic compression is less common and results from an aberrant renal vessel compressing the ureteropelvic junction. Presentation / Diagnosis : Most cases are diagnosed in the postnatal evaluation of an antenatally detected hydronephrosis. However, some newborns present with an abdominal or flank mass and a history of urinary tract infection or haematuria. Older children may present with severe intermittent fank or abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting, known as Dietl\u2019s crisis.

They are osteogenic tumors that consist of compact and spongious bone. They are usually asymptomatic except for cases where they cause hearing impairment or recurrent infections due to mass effect. They can be easily differentiated from sialolithiasis by location (usually gingival or ear canal when they affect the head and neck) and oval-shaped dense radio-opaque lesion with well-defined margins. Option D: Sialadenitis alone is easy to differentiate from sialolithiasis given its cystic nature compared to sialolithiasis. However, it is essential to note that patients may present with sialolith in chronic cases or may even have a sialolith as a causative factor (Results from the impedance of salivary flow with stasis due to obstruction from a sialolith). Thus, it is essential to watch for signs and symptoms of infection/abscess. Patients may present with painful swelling of the concerned salivary gland after eating (salivary colic). In bacterial sialadenitis, there may be a purulent discharge. Clinical features Intermittent, Peri prandial pain and swelling of a single salivary gland Risk factors include reduced fluid intake, tobacco use, prolonged illness, diuretics, and drugs that diminish saliva If inconclusive clinically, sialography is the gold standard for the diagnosis. Be aware that sialography is contraindicated in acute sialadenitis because it can worsen the infection In acute sialadenitis, the affected gland appears enlarged, hypoechoic, and hyperemic on ultrasound. In chronic infective forms, the affected gland appears atrophic and diffusely hypoechoic with irregular margins - the ultrasound appearances have been likened to that of a \u201ccirrhotic\u201d liver.</p>\n<p></p>",

These run from the cortical surface to the dura. Bridging veins are most commonly found along the sagittal sinus and around the anterior tip of the temporal lobe. SDHs are usually hemispheric in location, but they may occur along the falx or the tentorium or in the posterior fossa. An acute SDH with a thickness greater than 10 mm or a midline shift greater than 5 mm on computed tomography (CT) scan should be surgically evacuated, regardless of the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. Option C : Hydrocephalus is due to an accumulation of CSF within the brain which causes increased ICP. Older patients may have headaches , double vision , poor balance, urinary incontinence , personality changes, or mental impairment . While in babies, it may be seen as a rapid increase in head size. Option D: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), a stroke subtype, is a devastating condition whereby a hematoma is formed within the brain parenchyma with or without blood extension into the ventricles. Risk factors include chronic hypertension (Lipo hyalinosis and degenerative changes of penetrating arterioles result in Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms), amyloid angiopathy (alleles of the apolipoprotein E gene, allowing for increased amyloid deposition within vessel walls), anticoagulation (medication), and vascular malformations. The resultant brain injury is often classified as primary, this being the initial damage to the parenchyma by the blood clot, secondary, or the damage caused by complications from intracranial blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

This is known as ectopia vesicae or bladder exstrophy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Bladder Exstrophy: Bladder exstrophy is a congenital disorder in which failure of development of the lower abdominal wall leads to an abdominal wall defect through which the bladder is exposed Diastasis of the pubic symphysis and an anterior opening of the urethra (epispadias) can coexist. The condition forms part of a spectrum of conditions ranging from epispadias to bladder exstrophy or to more severe cloacal exstrophy, the so-called exstrophy\u2013epispadias complex. During development, mesenchymal ingrowth between the ectodermal and endodermal layers of the cloacal membrane leads to the formation of the lower abdominal wall muscles and pelvic bones. However, failure of this mesodermal ingrowth leads to premature rupture of the cloacal membrane and results in epispadias, bladder exstrophy or cloacal exstrophy, depending on the developmental stage at which rupture occurs. The incidence of bladder exstrophy is approximately 1 in 46 000 live births, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.3:1. Clinical features Exstrophy of the bladder can be associated with a spectrum of anomalies affecting the external genitalia, urinary system, bony pelvis, abdominal wall, rectum, and anus. Male external genitalia Shortened penis due to diastasis of the pubic symphysis resulting in wide separation of the crural attachments and congenital deficiency of the corporeal tissue. Female external genitalia Shortened, stenotic, and anteriorly displaced vagina. Bifd clitoris. Urinary system Incompetent bladder neck continence mechanism. VUR due to lack of obliquity of the vesicoureteric junction. Bony pelvis Widening (diastasis) of the pubic bones due to malrotation of the innominate bones, leading to a waddling gait. External rotation of the anterior and posterior segments of the bony pelvis, leading to outward rotation of the lower limbs. Abdominal wall Low-set umbilicus with a triangular-shaped lower abdominal wall fascial defect. Higher incidence of indirect inguinal hernia is due to the lack of oblique muscle fibers of the inguinal canal and extensive internal and external inguinal rings. Anorectum Shortened perineum and anteriorly displaced anus. Imperforate anus (without standard anal opening) or rectal stenosis. Rectal prolapse. Surgical treatment of bladder exstrophy surgical treatment aims to preserve renal function, achieve urinary continence and create functional and cosmetically acceptable external genitalia. The modern staged repair of exstrophy consists of bilateral iliac osteotomies with bladder exstrophy and abdominal wall closure in the neonatal period, followed by epispadias repair and phallic reconstruction at 6 months to 1 year of age, and fnally bladder neck reconstruction and bilateral ureteric reimplantation (to treat VUR) at age 5\u20137 years. More recently, complete primary repair of exstrophy in the neonatal period has been advocated in an attempt to optimise outcomes with fewer procedures and without a formal bladder neck closure procedure.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - Gastroschisis is usually defect on right side of umbilicus with exposed bowel Option B - Omphalocele is when bowel fail to return to abdominal cavity and are exposed through a defect in abdominal wall covered by two layers.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Saphenous Nerve Saphenous nerve is injured during stripping of the long saphenous vein below the knee. Saphenous nerve injury has long been recognized as a potential complication of greater saphenous vein stripping. Stripping of the vein in a downward fashion and stripping that ends just below the knee have been reported to decrease the risk of nerve injury, but they have not eliminated the risk. The saphenous nerve is located adjacent to the greater saphenous vein throughout much of its course. This association is particularly close from several centimeters below the knee to the medial malleolus. The nerve has several sizable branches that cross directly over the vein. These branches are particularly vulnerable to avulsion during upward stripping as the head used for the stripping procedure can engage and disrupt them.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>This is the longest vein in the body and is the most frequently affected by superficial incompetence. The GSV passes anterior to the medial malleolus and ascends the leg accompanied by the saphenous nerve in the superficial tissues medial to the tibia, looping posteriorly at the level of the medial condyle of the femur and continuing in the medial thigh. In the groin, it unites with tributaries corresponding to the arterial branches of the common femoral artery, before piercing the cribriform fascia covering the saphenous opening (approximately 2.5 cm below and lateral to the pubic tubercle, but often somewhat higher) and terminates by draining into the common femoral vein (CFV) at the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - The superficial peroneal nerve (superficial fibular nerve) is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information from the anterolateral aspect of the leg and the greater part of the dorsum of the foot (except for the first web space). Option B - Deep fibular nerve: Innervates the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg; tibialis anterior, Extensor Digitorum Longus and extensor hallucis longus. These muscles act to dorsiflex the foot, and extend the digits. It also innervates some intrinsic muscles of the foot. Option D - Sural nerve is injured during stripping of short saphenous vein.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Direct injury to the nerve can also occur during dissection at the ankle or in the vicinity of the knee. In contrast, deep nerve injuries are rare and reported especially when surgery involves the small saphenous vein (SSV). The deep motor nerves most commonly injured are the tibial nerve and the peroneal nerve, which are directly or indirectly affected by extrinsic compression, stretching, or healing process involvement.</p>\n<p></p>",

In suitable patients, successful reconstruction options include the use of large fasciocutaneous or musculocutaneous faps .

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pleomorphic Adenoma of Parotid Swelling below and behind the ear lobule pushing up is a classical presentation of parotid tumor. Most common parotid tumor is pleomorphic adenoma of parotid. It is also known as benign mixed tumors (BMT's), because of its dual origin from epithelial and myoepithelial elements. It is the commonest of all salivary gland tumors constituting up to two-thirds of all salivary gland tumors. It predominantly affects superficial lobe of the parotid gland. It mostly presents as a  solitary mobile slow-growing, painless mass, which may be present for many years. Symptoms and signs mainly depend on size, location, and potential to undergo malignant transformation. In the parotid gland, signs of facial nerve weakness occur when the tumor is large or if it undergoes malignant change. Pleomorphic adenoma in the deep lobe of the parotid gland may present as an oral retro tonsillar or parapharyngeal mass which is visible or usually palpable. Rapid enlargement of a tumor nodule should raise a concern of malignant change. Minor salivary gland tumors may present with a variety of symptoms, including dysphagia, hoarseness,  dyspnea, difficulty in chewing, and epistaxis dependent on the site of the tumor.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma tumor is a locally invasive tumor of salivary glands usually located on the palate.

Bezold\u2019s abscess is a rare deep neck abscess and is an intratemporal complication of a coalescent mastoiditis, wherein the infection erodes through the lateral mastoid cortex medial to the attachment of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. Once the infection has reached this space, it can progress into the infratemporal fossa and travel deep to the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia. The spread of infection in this layer can lead to a progressive cellulitis/abscess, but can also proceed toward the carotid sheath, and thrombosis of the internal jugular vein can occur.</p>\n<p></p>",

An associated rise in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels confirms the hepatic origin of ALP.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Type of jaundice Bile pigment Bile salt Urobilinogen Pre-hepatic (hemolytic) Nil Nil ++ Hepatocellular ++ + Normal Post-hepatic (obstructive) +++ ++ Nil</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options B and D: Hemolytic jaundice is a common causes of prehepatic jaundice. Causes include sickle cell anemia, spherocytosis. and thalassemia. Inherited enzyme disorders, such as Gilbert\u2019s syndrome, and Crigler-Najjar types I and II, are some of the other important causes. In such cases, there is an isolated elevation of unconjugated bilirubin. Option C: Hepatic jaundice shows an elevation of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) out of proportion to ALP . An increased bilirubin level is also seen. Common causes include viral hepatitis. alcoholic liver disease, and autoimmune hepatitis . An AST/ALT ratio > 2 is highly suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis .</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Specimen Test Pre-hepatic or hemolytic or retention jaundice Hepatocellular jaundice Post-hepatic or obstructive or regurgitation jaundice Blood Unconjugated bilirubin (van den Bergh indirect test) ++ ++ Normal Conjugated bilirubin (van den Bergh direct test Normal Excretion is rate-limiting.
