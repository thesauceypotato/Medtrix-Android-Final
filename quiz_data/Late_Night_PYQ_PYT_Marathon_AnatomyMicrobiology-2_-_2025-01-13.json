Opsonizing antibodies, particularly IgG against the bacterial capsule, are crucial for effective phagocytosis and clearance of encapsulated organisms. A deficiency in these antibodies compromises the immune system's ability to target and eliminate Haemophilus influenzae, leading to recurrent infections characterized by fever, hemolytic anemia, and meningitis.

Its extensive presence in various joints and supportive structures, its role in the growth and development of long bones (epiphyseal plates), and its ability to resist compressive forces make it notably prevalent.

It joins the aponeurosis of the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles to form the pes anserinus.</li><li>\u2022 The sartorius muscle is responsible for several actions, including flexion, abduction, and lateral rotation of the thigh, as well as flexion of the leg.
