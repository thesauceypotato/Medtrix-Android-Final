      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Calendar method In the given question, as described she abstain from having intercourse during D8-D19 which is defined as the unsafe period in the calendar method. According to this method, the safe period is the first 7 days and the last 7 days.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Natural Family Planning Method It is the method of planning family without using any drugs or contraceptives. Basis: These methods aim at avoiding sexual intercourse around ovulation. The timing of ovulation can be judged on calendar basis and symptom basis. Rhythm method/calendar method: It is based on ogino knaus theory which states ovulation occurs on day 14 \u00b1 2 in a female with a regular 28 days cycle (i.e. avoid sex between 12th and 16th day) But fertilizable span of sperm is 48 - 72 hours and ova is 12 - 24 hours. Therefore, unsafe period = 8 - 18 day (Failure rate = 25-35%) Failure rate can be reduced if sex is avoided from 7-21 day if (failure rate = 10%) Thus sex is safe only in the first and last 7 days of a menstrual cycle (park 20/e, p 436) In irregular cycle: Safe period is shortest cycle - 18 (gives first day of the fertile period) longest cycle - 11 (gives last day of the fertile period). Advantage: Low cost and lack of side effects Drawback: Difficult to predict safe period if cycles are irregular Can only be used by educated and responsible couples with a high degree of motivation and cooperation. Compulsory abstinence of sexual intercourse for nearly half month called as programmed sex. Not applicable during postnatal period. High failure rate -9/100 WY. Standard Days Method (In India called as Tirumala Method) Developed by Georgetown University's Institute for Reproductive Health. It has a simpler rule set and is more effective than the rhythm method. A product, called Cyclebeads, was developed alongside the method to help the user keep track of estimated high and low fertility points during her menstrual cycle. The Standard Days Method can only be used by women whose cycles are always between 26 and 32 days in length. In this system: Days 1-7 of a woman's menstrual cycle are considered infertile. Days 8-19 are considered fertile. From day 20, infertility is considered to resume. Failure rate of 2/100 WY. Cervical Mucus Method (Billings Method) This method is based on the observation of changes in the characteristics of cervical mucus. At the time of ovulation - Cervical mucus is watery, clear (resembling raw eggs white), smooth, slippery and profuse . After ovulation, under the influence of progesterone, the mucus thickens and lessens in quantity. It is recommended that women use tissue paper to wipe inside the vagina to assess the quantity and character of mucus. Intercourse is considered to be safe during the dry days immediately after the menses and till the mucus is detected. Thereafter the couple must abstain until the fourth day after the peek day. To practice this method, the women should be able to distinguish between the different types of mucus. This requires a high degree of motivation. Cervical mucus method (Billings method) is based on the principle that under the influence of estrogen, cervical mucus is thin, watery, profuse and elastic (it can be stretched between fingres called Spinnbarkeit). Whereas after ovulation under the influence of progesterone it becomes thick, scanty and loses its elastic nature and breaks on stretching called as Tack. Basal Body Temperature Method A woman's basal body temperature (BBT) drops briefly and then rises half a degree following ovulation, and remains elevated in the secretory phase. Normal BBT is between 96 and 98 degrees, and after ovulation rises to 97-98 degrees Fahrenheit or rises by 0.2-0.5\u00b0C. A rise in temperature that persists for at least 3 days indicates that ovulation has occurred. The safe period begins from the fourth day (the first day being the day of ovulation) to the last day of the next period. For this method to be effective, a chart of daily temperature reading needs to be kept. Symptothermic Method This method makes use of at least two indicators to identify the fertile period. Usually, the cervical mucus method and the BBT methods are combined. Withdrawal Method Withdrawal method or coitus interruptus means discharge of semen outside the female genitalia at the time of the intercourse . Contraindication Premature ejaculation</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. - Basal body temperature- the temperature rises by 0.5 degree Celsius following ovulation. Hence the unsafe period is 3 days of the rise of temperature. Option: C. \u2013 Mucus method- in this abstinence is required on all days of noticeable mucus and for 3 days thereafter .</p>\n<p></p>",
