      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Olfactory Receptor Cell Olfactory receptor cells are primary afferent neurons located in the olfactory epithelium within the upper levels of the nasal cavities. They are unusual neurons because they are replaced continually throughout life, turning over every 4 to 8 weeks. Olfactory receptor cells are true to primary afferent neurons that conduct action potentials along their axons into the central nervous system (CNS), where they synapse onto second-order neurons in glomeruli within the olfactory bulb.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The other receptor cells listed are epithelial-derived cells that lack axons. Sensory information from these cells is conveyed by peripheral synapses to axonal terminals of primary afferent neurons that project (often over long distances) into the CNS.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Auditory hair cells, and bitter taste cells are all specialized sensory cells that detect stimuli in the environment, but they are not primary afferent neurons.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Olfactory receptor cells have sensory cilia on an epithelial surface and turn over every few weeks similar to epithelial receptor cells. However, they are true neurons. Odorants are concentrated and presented to olfactory receptor proteins by odorant-binding proteins in the mucus, which also contain antibodies and enzymes. Each olfactory receptor neuron produces only one of a large family of about 10,000 odorant receptor proteins. The olfactory epithelium is also innervated by the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), which contains axons of nociceptive chemoreceptors that have free nerve endings that detect noxious chemicals in the air, such as ammonia and chlorine (as well as components of peppermint and menthol). Activation of these epithelial nociceptors elicits defensive reflexes such as sneezing, lacrimation, and respiratory inhibition.</p>\n<p></p>",
