B) Uterine contractility is mediated by innervations from level T7 - T8</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The incorrect statement regarding the innervation of the uterus is option B. Uterine contractility is primarily mediated by hormonal mechanisms rather than by specific spinal innervations. Hormones such as estrogen, prostaglandins, and oxytocin play a significant role in inducing uterine contractions, while progesterone helps maintain uterine relaxation.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Sensory level is from T10 to L1: The sensory innervation of the uterus is indeed from spinal levels T10 to L1. These afferent fibers enter the spinal cord via the inferior hypogastric plexus and are responsible for transmitting sensory information from the uterus.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Sensory level is from T10 to L1:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. In the 1st stage of labor, pain is due to the fibers at level of T10 - L1: During the 1st stage of labor, pain is mediated by spinal segments T10 to L1. This pain is due to the distension of the cervix and lower uterine segment, as well as the contraction of the uterus.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. In the 1st stage of labor, pain is due to the fibers at level of T10 - L1:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. In early labor, pain is usually because of the uterine contraction: In early labor, pain is usually related to uterine contractions, which stimulate nociceptors in the genital tract and can cause discomfort and pain.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. In early labor, pain is usually because of the uterine contraction:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Uterine contractility is not mediated by innervations from spinal level T7 - T8; instead, it is primarily influenced by hormonal mechanisms.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Page 500, DC Dutta\u2019s Textbook of Obstetrics, 8 th edition</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Page 500, DC Dutta\u2019s Textbook of Obstetrics, 8 th edition</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

During an OGTT, a patient ingests a specified amount of glucose (commonly 75 grams), and blood glucose levels are measured at intervals to evaluate how well the body handles glucose. In a normal response:</li><li>\u2022 Blood glucose levels rise to a peak within 1 hour after ingestion. Glucose levels then decline and return to baseline by 2 hours. The glucose levels do not exceed the renal threshold at any point during the test.</li><li>\u2022 Blood glucose levels rise to a peak within 1 hour after ingestion.</li><li>\u2022 Glucose levels then decline and return to baseline by 2 hours.</li><li>\u2022 The glucose levels do not exceed the renal threshold at any point during the test.</li><li>\u2022 This pattern reflects the body's effective regulation of blood glucose levels and the normal function of insulin.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

It can lead to preterm births, preeclampsia, and pregnancy loss while the infant can suffer from neonatal lupus and heart block. Management includes Preconceptionally counseling: Conception during a period of quiescence for at least 6 months determines a successful outcome. Stable remission of renal disease for at least 6 months before conception is recommended. Corticosteroids are useful during episodes of lupus flare and can be used safely in pregnancy. Immunosuppressants such as azathioprine can be continued during pregnancy. It may be used in case of severe SLE Hydroxychloroquine is found to be the best for maintenance and is safe in pregnancy. It can prevent the need for prolonged corticosteroid therapy.

Correct : A blow to the pterion can be very dangerous because the middle meningeal artery runs just deep to this area, on the inner side of the skull.

The pterion is located just above the zygomatic arch and anterior to the ear. The middle meningeal artery, a branch of the maxillary artery, runs underneath the pterion and is at risk of injury in cases of head trauma.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
