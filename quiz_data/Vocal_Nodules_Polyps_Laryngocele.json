      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Prevents pharyngeal collapse during expiration CPAP prevents pharyngeal collapse during expiration, which is effective for obstructive sleep apnea.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The purpose of CPAP is to stent open the airway, which typically collapses during end-expiration in OSA patients. CPAP can stent open the collapsed segment during end-expiration. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) provides a pneumatic splint to the airway and increases its calibre. The optimum airway pressure for a device to open the airway is determined during a sleep study and is usually kept at 5\u201320 cm H2O When CPAP is not tolerated, a BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) device is used. It delivers positive pressure at two fixed levels\u2014a higher inspiratory and a lower expiratory pressure. An auto-titrating PAP (APAP) is also available, continuously adjusting the pressure. Their disadvantages are the same as those of CPAP.</p>\n<p></p>",
