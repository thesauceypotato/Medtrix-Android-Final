      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>None of the above All above statements are correct One of the limitations of mammography is that it produces a 2D radiographic view of what is a 3D structure and, as a consequence, cancers may not be detected due to overlapping normal glandular tissue obscuring the presence of a tumour, leading to false negative interpretations. This is a particular issue in women with a denser background glandular pattern, typically younger, pre-menopausal women, where the sensitivity of mammography for detecting malignancy may be below 50%. In addition, lesions may be simulated by the superimposition of normal tissue, leading to false positive interpretations and unnecessary recalls following screening mammography. Breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a digital mammographic technique which aims to alleviate these issues. It produces thin slices through the breast, reconstructed from multiple low-dose projections acquired at different angles of the x-ray tube.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>SUMMARY BOX: Digital Breast Tomosynthesis DBT is a mammographic technique producing thin slice images through the breast, reducing the effects of tissue superimposition DBT can improve the sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer screening by increasing cancer detection rates and reducing recall rates \u2022 DBT is replacing the traditional spot compression view in the work-up of screen detected abnormalities</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A.
