Braxton-Hick's sign : Intermittent, painless uterine contractions are difficult to be observed before the third month but are easily felt after the fourth month. Each contraction lasts about a minute and lasts for about two to three minutes. They are present even when the Foetus is dead. Option: C. From the second month, the cervix progressively softens from below upward, which is well-marked by the fourth month. This is known as Goodell's sign. There is a shortening of the cervix towards the last months of pregnancy. The orifice becomes circular instead of being transverse and admits the point of the finger to a greater depth. Option: D. Piskacek's sign notes a noticeable lateral bulge or soft prominence at one of the locations where the uterine tube meets the uterus.</p>\n<p></p>",
