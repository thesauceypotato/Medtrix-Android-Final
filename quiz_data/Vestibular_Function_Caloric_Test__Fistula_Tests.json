Warm water to the same side (remember mnemonic COWS: cold-opposite, warm-same). Depending on the response to the caloric test, we can find canal paresis or dead labyrinth, directional preponderance, i.e. nystagmus is more in one particular direction than in the other, or both canal paresis and directional preponderance.</p>\n<p></p>",

O ption C. Vestibular Neuronitis is characterised by severe vertigo of sudden onset with no cochlear symptoms. Attacks may last from a few days to 2 or 3 weeks. It is thought to occur due to a virus that attacks the vestibular ganglion. Management of acute attack is similar to that in M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease. The disease is usually self-limiting Option D. Head Trauma Head injury may cause concussion of the labyrinth, completely disrupt the bony labyrinth or even the VIIIth nerve, or cause a perilymph fistula. Severe acoustic trauma, such as the one caused by an explosion, can also disturb the vestibular end organs and result in vertigo.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Hennebert\u2019s phenomenon - Dysequilibrium following nose blowing or lifting a heavy object.

In Diffuse Serous Labyrinthitis, Mild cases complain of vertigo and nausea, but in severe cases, vertigo is worse with marked nausea, vomiting and even spontaneous nystagmus. The quick component of nystagmus is towards the affected ear. As the inflammation is diffused, the cochlea is also affected by some degree of sensorineural hearing loss. Option C. In Diffuse Suppurative Labyrinthitis, there is severe vertigo with nausea and vomiting due to acute vestibular failure. Spontaneous nystagmus will be observed with its quick component towards the healthy side. The patient is markedly toxic. There is a total loss of hearing. Relief from vertigo is seen after 3-6 weeks due to adaptation. Option D.

Modified Kobrak Test It is a quick office procedure. The patient is seated with head tilted 60\u00b0 backwards to place the horizontal canal in a vertical position. The ear is irrigated with ice water for 60 s, first with 5 ml and if there is no response,10,29 and 40 ml . Normally Nystagmus beating towards the opposite ear will be seen with 5 ml of ice water. If response is seen with increased quantities of water between 5 and 40, labyrinth is considered hypoactive. No response to 40 ml of watering indicates a dead labyrinth. Option C. Electronystagmography is a method of detecting and recording nystagmus, which is spontaneous or induced by caloric, positional, rotational or optokinetic stimulus. The test depends on the presence of corneoretinal potentials, which are recorded by placing electrodes at suitable places around the eyes. The test is also helpful to detect nystagmus, which is not seen with the naked eye. It also permits to keep a permanent record of nystagmus. Option D . In the Optokinetic test, the patient is asked to follow a series of vertical stripes on a drum, moving first from right to left and then from left to right. Usually, it produces nystagmus with a slow components in the direction of moving stripes and a fast components in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p></p>",

A false positive fistula test (i.e. positive fistula test without a fistula) is seen in congenital syphilis and about 25% of cases of Meniere\u2019s disease (Hennebert's sign). In congenital syphilis, the stapes footplate is hypermobile, while in Meniere\u2019s disease, it is due to the fibrous bands connecting the utricular macula to the stapes footplate. In both these conditions, movements of stapes result in stimulation of the utricular macula. Option D . A false negative fistula test is also seen when cholesteatoma covers the site of the fistula and does not allow pressure changes to be transmitted to the labyrinth.</p>\n<p></p>",
