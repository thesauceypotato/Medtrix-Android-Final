Blastomyces dermatitidis is the causal agent of blastomycosis, an invasive and often severe fungal infection. Blastomyces dermatitidis, a thermally dimorphic fungus, causes blastomycosis. This fungus exists as a mold at room temperature. \u2022 The diagnosis of Blastomycosis is confirmed by clinical evaluation that includes chest X-ray studies which may reveal findings that are consistent with fungal pneumonia, i.e., consolidation or cavitation. The direct microscopic examination of infected material, i.e., pus, sputum, or urine, is also performed.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - The finding of encapsulated budding cells in spinal fluid - is not the most useful diagnosis.
