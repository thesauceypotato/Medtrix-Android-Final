      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Patient's own endogenous bacterial flora Systemic chemotherapy targets rapidly dividing cancer cells but often incidentally damage other rapidly dividing cells in the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow, which dramatically increases the risk of infection due to the following: Mucositis - Damage to rapidly dividing epithelial cells of the digestive tract creates breaches in the mucosal barrier that allow endogenous bacterial flora (commensal organisms) to penetrate and enter the bloodstream. Gram-negative enteric bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and gram-positive skin organisms, like Staphylococcus epidermidis and aureus, are most likely to invade. Neutropenia - Damage to rapidly dividing granulopoietic cells reduces circulating neutrophil count. Because neutrophils serve as a front-line defence against bacterial and fungal pathogens, commensal pathogens that penetrate the mucosal/cutaneous barrier cannot be contained and spread to the bloodstream and deeper tissues. Neutropenic patients have weak inflammatory responses, and fever is often the only sign of infection (neutropenic fever).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>To reduce the risk of serious infection, patients who receive systemic chemotherapy are often empirically treated with prophylactic antibiotics (g., ciprofloxacin) to prevent commensal organisms from invading and with granulocyte-stimulating agents (e.g., filgrastim) to increase neutrophil count.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Environmental pathogens such as Histoplasma (in bird droppings), Mycobacterium avium complex (in water), and Cryptococcus (in soil contaminated by bird droppings) often cause opportunistic infection in those with advanced AIDS due to impaired cell-mediated immunity. Although these pathogens can cause infections in those with neutropenia, most cases of neutropenic fever are due to endogenous commensal organisms. Option B. Hospital-acquired, drug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S aureus, can cause neutropenic fever but do so much less often than endogenous commensal bacteria. Option C. Pathogens spread from infected contacts (g., influenza) are more likely to cause severe infection in those with impaired immunity. However, the greatest cause of neutropenic fever is endogenous bacterial flora.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Infections arising from a person's own flora are considered endogenous. One way an endogenous infection can occur is for a bacterium which normally resides in one part of the body is introduced to another. An example is E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae</p>\n<p></p>",

A bone marrow biopsy was performed to evaluate the underlying etiology of thrombocytopenia. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and asthma were diagnosed, and he was treated with prednisolone and oral beclomethasone spray. From the age of 3 to 6, he suffered from asthma attacks and was admitted to ICU several times. Also, he developed generalised eczema when he was 6 years old. Two of his uncles reportedly died in childhood after experiencing similar symptoms. Physical examination revealed generalized eczema and normal growth.

Her last menstrual cycle was two weeks ago, and they have been occurring regularly. There is no history of renal stones, NSAID abuse, weight loss, night sweats, fever, melena, or hemoptysis. Her vital signs were unremarkable. On initial evaluation, CBC, urinalysis, and renal ultrasound were normal, and the urine pregnancy test was negative. A few days later, she developed jaundice with abdominal pain. Repeat testing at that time showed the following: WBC count 3600/mm3, haemoglobin 4 g/dL, platelet count 189,000/ mm3, MCV 75 fl, RDW 28, reticulocyte count 10.9 per cent (N.V.= 0.5-2.3%), total serum bilirubin 7.5 mg/dL (N.V.= 0.10-1.2 mg/dL), indirect bilirubin 5.5 mg/dL (N.V.= 0.10-1.0 mg/dL), AST 213 U/L serum LDH 1500 U/L (nv= 259-613), serum haptoglobin < 10 mg/dL. The urinalysis showed hemoglobinuria. The Direct Coombs test is negative. Liver ultrasound shows mild hepatomegaly and no signs of stones, biliary ductal dilatation, or hepatic mass. Flow cytometry of peripheral blood smear was performed. which of the complement protein defect is suspected in the above patient?",
