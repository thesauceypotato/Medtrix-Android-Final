      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ALL is the most common childhood malignancy that peaks between 2 and 5 years of age. B-ALL is most common in 1st decade of life whereas T-ALL is more common after the first decade. Laboratory investigations show high TLC count (>1,00,000 cells/mm3) and pancytopenia. Clinical features are attributed to bone marrow infiltration with leukemic cells (bone marrow failure) and extramedullary involvement, including pallor, fatigue, petechiae, purpura or bleeding , and infections. Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are present in more than 60% of cases of ALL. t(12;21) confirms it as ALL.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The presence of t(12:21) indicates a good prognosis.

Myelomonocytic leukemia is an M4 type of AML according to FAB classification. This also shows organomegaly and high leukocyte But t(12;21) is not seen in AML Option C. CML constitutes 3% of childhood leukemias characterized by myeloid hyperplasia of the bone marrow, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and elevated TLC. A specific cytogenetic marker in CML is the Philadelphia chromosome. Option D. Hodgkin lymphoma arises from the B cell lineage that involves lymph nodes and the lymphatic system. They present with painless cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats, and loss of body weight. Pancytopenia and high TLC count are unlikely.</p>\n<p></p>",
