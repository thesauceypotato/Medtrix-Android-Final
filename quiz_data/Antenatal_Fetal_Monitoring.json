The contraction stress test (CST) is based on the response of FHR to uterine contractions , with the premise that fetal oxygenation will be worsened. This results in late decelerations in an already suboptimally oxygenated fetus. The test requires 3 contractions in 10 minutes , a positive or abnormal test is when late decelerations occur with more than half of the contractions, suspicious with any late decelerations, and negative with no late decelerations. The most significant finding for hypoxia is late deceleration. Late decelerations are smooth falls in the FHR beginning after the contractions has started and ending after the contractions has ended. They are associated with fetal hypoxemia and potential for perinatal morbidity and mortality . Variable decelerations are abrupt in decline and return to baseline, vary in timing with the contractions, and usually represents cord compression. As far as sinusoidal pattern is concerned \u201cIntrapartum sinusoidal fetal heart patterns were not generally associated with fetal compromise\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>",
