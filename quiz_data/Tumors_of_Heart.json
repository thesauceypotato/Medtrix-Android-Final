These are benign neoplasms arising from primitive multipotent mesenchymal cells. Familial syndromes associated with myxomas have activating mutations in the GNAS1 gene , encoding a subunit of G protein (Gs\u03b1) (in association with McCune-Albright syndrome ) or null mutations in PRKAR1A , encoding a regulatory subunit of a cyclic-AMP\u2013dependent protein kinase ( Carney complex ). About 90% of myxomas arise in the atria , with a left-to-right ratio of approximately 4:1 . Atrial myxoma. (A) A large sessile lesion arises from the region of the fossa ovalis and extends into the mitral valve orifice.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Myxoma The patient is diagnosed with McCune Albright syndrome , and ECHO shows a mass causing ball-valve obstruction of the mitral valve orifice (i.e. mass arising from left atria) is suggestive of Myxoma .

Lipoma. Incorrect , the conventional lipoma is a well-encapsulated mass of mature adipocytes . The fat contains a few small capillaries within thin fibrous strands . A thin fibrous capsule is often seen. Fat necrosis and other inflammatory changes may be seen when lipomas are traumatized. Option: C. Rhabdomyoma. Incorrect , Rhabdomyomas are gray-white myocardial masses that can be small or up to several centimeters in diameter. They are usually multiple and involve the ventricles preferentially. Microscopically, they are composed of bizarre, markedly enlarged myocytes with large collections of glycogen . Routine histologic processing removes the glycogen and artifactually reduces the abundant cytoplasm to thin strands that stretch from the nucleus to the surface membrane, an appearance referred to as \u201cspider\u201d cells . Option: D. Fibroelastoma. Incorrect , located on valves , particularly the ventricular surfaces of semilunar valves and the atrial surfaces of atrioventricular valves . Histologically, the projections are covered by a surface endothelium surrounding a core of myxoid connective tissue with abundant mucopolysaccharide matrix and elastic fibers.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Sometimes fragmentation and systemic embolization can be seen.
