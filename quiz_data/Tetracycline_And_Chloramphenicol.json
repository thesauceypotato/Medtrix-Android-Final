It can be sold and used in combination with clavulanate as ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. Because it is a penicillin, it also falls within the larger class of beta-lactam antibiotics. Its main clinical use is as an injectable antibiotic for the treatment of Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris.

Slow acetylators: ( 60-70% of Indians) t1/2 of INH 3hr Slow acetylators will not be able to metabolize the drug quickly and there will be accumulation of isoniazid.

Iron is needed to produce the red blood cells that carry oxygen around your body. Option: D . Vitamin B-12 also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin involved in metabolism. It is one of eight B vitamins. It is required by animals, which use it as a cofactor in DNA synthesis, and in both fatty acid and amino acid metabolism.</p>\n<p></p>",
