Alcohol-based hand rubs are preferred in most cases, but soap and water should be used for visibly soiled hands and in cases of outbreaks of certain pathogens like Clostridium difficile. Hand hygiene should be performed before and after every direct patient contact, before donning gloves, and after removing gloves. Additionally, hand hygiene should be performed while moving from a contaminated site to a clean site during patient care. It is important to note that using hand rub is not appropriate if the hands are visibly soiled, as the rub cannot effectively remove dirt and debris from the hands.
