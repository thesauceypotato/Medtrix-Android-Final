      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Encroachment of the defect toward fixation The Image shows the presence of a superior nasal step defect. Visual field defects seen in cases of glaucoma are shown in the image below: Areas of the retina and/or optic nerve damaged by glaucoma are believed to be more vulnerable to ongoing damage at lower intraocular pressures (IOP) , thereby, field defects tend to become more severe with time. New defects also may appear, of course, but generally accompany the progression of previous defects.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Abnormalities in the visual field are a sign of damage anywhere in the visual system from the retina through to the brain\u2019s visual cortex. Visual field defects are, therefore, not limited to glaucoma. It is very important to examine the retina and optic disc carefully to assess whether or not a visual field defect matches the appearance of the disc and retina, or fits with other clinical signs.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options A, B, and C are shown below -</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>One should be very wary of a person with extensive field loss, which seems genuine, where examination of the retina and optic disc is normal. Early glaucomatous visual field defects are subtle and easily missed. Even with modern automated and sensitive visual field analyzers, glaucomatous visual field loss is not evident until at least 30% of the retinal ganglion cell axons that make up the optic nerve have been lost.</p>\n<p></p>",

The given case history and findings point towards the diagnosis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

As in this case, patients often report difficulty with tasks involving fine visual skills, such as reading, as well as visual color deficits.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Monocular blindness describes a total vision loss in one eye that can be caused by ischemia of the vessels supplying the retina, retinal vein occlusion, optic nerve compression, or optic nerve neuropathy. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine, however, is not associated with such a complication. Option: C. Hemianopia with macular sparing is a form of homonymous hemianopia in which the central visual field is spared. The visual cortex receives a dual blood supply from the posterior cerebral artery (supplies the anterior visual cortex, which processes peripheral vision) and the deep branch of the middle cerebral artery (supplies the occipital pole, which processes information from the central visual field). Infarcts of the PCA would therefore lead to hemianopia with macular sparing. Hydroxychloroquine , in contrast, may specifically damage the macula. Option: D. Bitemporal hemianopia describes the loss of vision in the outer halves of the visual field of both eyes. It is typically caused by a compression of the central region of the optic chiasm due to midline pathologies such as aneurysms, pituitary masses, or craniopharyngioma. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine, however, is associated with damage to the retina itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Paracentral scotoma represents a more advanced stage of retinopathy and is an irreversible complication of hydroxychloroquine whose incidence increases with both the dose and the duration of treatment.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Residual central and temporal islands of vision. Advanced glaucomatous field changes show small, residual central and temporal islands of vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Paracentral scotoma describes an off-center area of visual loss surrounded by normal acuity in the rest of the visual field. As in this case, patients often report difficulty with tasks involving fine visual skills, such as reading, as well as visual color deficits.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Nasal step is the appearance of a horizontal shelf in the nasal visual field, caused by an asymmetry in nerve fiber loss at the two poles. Option: C. Seidel\u2019s scotoma appears to start at the poles of the blind spot and arches over the macular area, without reaching the horizontal meridian nasally. Option: D. Paracentral scotomas are areas where smaller or dimmer targets are not visualized by the patient, but larger or brighter targets are appreciated.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Perimetry is used to estimate the visual field. Types: Manual perimetry- Confrontation method, Lister's perimeter, Campimetry (Scotometry), Goldmann's perimeter Automated perimetry- Octopus Fieldmaster, Humphrey Field Analyzer Other options \u2013 which are mentioned above are the types of Perimetry.</p>\n<p></p>",
