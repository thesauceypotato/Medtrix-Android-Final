In such case, direct evidence can be given only by B that he had seen C committing a crime</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Direct Evidence: Evidence of a fact that is actually in issue, e.g., an electric blanket that has caused injury, prescription, or a consent form. Option: B & C. Indirect or Circumstantial Evidence: It is not the direct testimony of an eye witness, but has a bearing upon the fact of the other and subsidiary facts which are relied upon as consistent (S.6, l.E.A.), e.g., in case of the alleged murder of A by B at a certain place on a particular day and time, the circumstantial evidence would be that C saw B with a knife on that day at that place, a few minutes before the murder. Circumstantial evidence requires the Court to draw logical or reasonable inferences from the information presented.</p>\n<p></p>",

A common witness (witness of fact; occurrence witness) is a person who gives evidence about the facts observed or perceived by him. He must show that he was capable of perceiving the fact by one of his own senses and that he actually observed this fact. This principle is commonly known as the \"first-hand knowledge rule\", which may be used to establish the exact circumstances of the case for the Court, e.g., A has seen B and C, fighting with sticks on a certain road on a particular day and time. In the case of a traffic accident, the person who witnessed the accident becomes a common witness. Option: B. An expert witness is a person who has been trained or is skilled or has knowledge, experience or education in a technical or scientific subject, and capable of drawing opinions and conclusions from the facts observed by himself or noticed by others, e.g., a doctor, firearms expert, fingerprints expert, handwriting expert, etc. (S. 45, I.E.A.) Option: D. Hostile Witness- Hostile witness is one who is supposed to have some interest or motive for concealing part of the truth, or for giving completely false evidence. The Court will declare a witness as hostile on the suggestion of the lawyer of the party who has summoned the witness or prosecution lawyer.</p>\n<p></p>",

This given case is known as Perjury, where the witness under the oath gives false/ fabricated evidence. A hostile witness is one who is supposed to have some interest or motive for concealing part of the truth, or for giving completely false evidence. The court will declare a witness hostile on the suggestion of the lawyer of the party who has summoned the witness or prosecution lawyer. On declaration of a witness as hostile, he can be cross-examined by the same side lawyer. Perjury means giving wilful false/ fabricated evidence. Whoever, being legally bound by an oath, or by an express provision of law to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any statement which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, is said to give false evidence. It occurs if the person's earlier statement regarding the facts on oath and subsequent statement on oath are opposed to each other, and cannot be reconciled. The witness is liable to be prosecuted for perjury, and the imprisonment may extend to seven years (S. 193I.P.C.).

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1,3,6 An expert witness is a person who has been trained or is skilled or has knowledge, experience or education in a technical or scientific subject, and capable of drawing opinions and conclusions from the facts observed by himself or noticed by others; eg.- Doctor, firearm expert, fingerprint expert. The evidence of the witness is recorded as follows Sec 138 to 159IEA. Under the Indian Oath Act, of The witness has to take an oath in the witness box before he gives his evidence. He should take the oath as follows: \"I do swear in the name of God, that what I shall state shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth\". If the witness is an atheist, he has to \"solemnly affirm\" instead of \"swearing in the name of God.\" An oath is a declaration required by the law, which is compulsory and holds the witness responsible for the consequences of his evidence. A child below 12 years is not required to take an oath. Examination-in-chief (direct examination) (Sec.137I.E.A.) - This is the first examination of a witness. It consists of questions put to him by the lawyer (counsel or advocate) for the side which has summoned him. In criminal acts committed by an individual or group, the State becomes a party instead of the aggrieved person and starts criminal prosecution, which is titled \"State versus A\".(Point 1) ln, a criminal trial, the burden to prove is always on the prosecution (adversarial system of trial). and the accused is presumed to be innocent till the contrary is proved against him. In Government prosecution cases. the public prosecutor first examines the witness. If a witness is called by a private party, he is first examined by the lawyer of that party. The object is to elicit all relevant, convincing medical facts and the conclusions that the doctor has drawn from the facts. The doctor may have to interpret the findings of non-medical ancillary investigations provided by scientific laboratories, analysts and serologists, in all cases where the medical aspects are at issue. Before giving evidence, it is advisable that the doctor meets the public prosecutor, and discuss the previously prepared report, the certificate of death, photographs, etc., that the witness intends to show in the Court, and an outline or pattern should be worked out for the best way to elicit his testimony. A leading question is one which suggests to the witness the answer desired, or which includes a material fact, and admits of a conclusive answer by a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\". \"Was this injury caused by a sharp weapon?\" Was the length of the cut 3 cm?\" They are all leading questions, as they suggest the answer \"Yes\" or \"No\". The proper questions should be: \"What type of weapon would cause this injury?\" What was the length of the cut?. Where was it seen\"?(Point 2) Cross-examination - In this, the witness is questioned by the lawyer for the opposite party, i.e., a lawyer for the accused (defence lawyer). In a murder trial, the defence witness is cross-examined by the public prosecutor. The main objects are To elicit facts favourable to his case, To test the accuracy of the statements made by the witness, To modify, or explain what has been said, To develop new or old facts, (5) to discredit the witness, and To remove any undue or excessive emphasis which may have been given to any of them. There is no time limit for cross-examination. Leading questions are allowed in cross-examination. (Points 3 and 6) Re-examination (Re-direct examination): This is conducted by the lawyer for the side which has called the witness. The object is to correct any mistake or to clarify or add details to the statements the witness has made in cross-examination. It is an opportunity for the witness to explain more fully some answer which might appear damaging to his direct evidence, because of skilful questioning or tactics by the cross-examiner. The witness should not bring in any new matter at this stage. The opposing lawyer has the right of re-cross-examination on the new point raised. Leading questions are not allowed. (Point 4) Never attempt to memorise reports presented in court. The law allows refreshing your memory from copies of reports already submitted or from case notes and similar records made at the time of examination. (Point 5) Options regarding Direct examination, cross-examination and the time limit for cross-examination are correctly matched to the given explanations.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Facts about the leading question, Re-direct examination and about refreshing memory from reports in the court are wrongly matched. Option: C. Re-examination is conducted by the lawyer for the side which has called the witness and the law allows you to refresh your memory from copies of reports already submitted or from case notes and similar records made at the time of examination, it is wrongly matched. Option: D. Leading questions are allowed only during cross-examination. They are defined under 141IEA. Leading questions are not permitted in the chief examination. For hostile witnesses, leading questions can be asked by the defence lawyer during the chief examination.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Person especially skilled in foreign law, science or art (Sec.45IEA) is an Expert witness. A witness is a person who gives sworn testimony(evidence) in a court of law as regards facts and/or inferences that can be drawn from these. There are 2 types of witnesses most commonly - Common witness; Expert witness. Common witness/ ordinary or lay witness- someone who observes and gives evidence about the crime which he saw as he was present there at the time of it. Eg. an eyewitness. Expert witness or skilled witness- opinion obtained from a qualified person. Eg. doctor, firearm expert, fingerprint expert, serologist. An expert witness can give his expert opinion from his area of expertise or qualification. Expert witness is a person who has been trained or skilled in a technical or scientific subject. He can volunteer a statement if he feels that justice is likely to be miscarried owing of the court having failed to elicit an important point. Doctors are not necessarily expert witnesses. Medical practitioners are considered \u2018professional witnesses\u2019 akin to witnesses of fact when he/she is providing factual medical evidence. They can be testifying about events that they themselves have observed, e.g., the doctor may confirm the physical examination findings in case of an accident or a diagnosis made after investigation or may report the findings of an X-ray or treatment given to the patient. The difference between a \u2018professional witness\u2019 and an \u2018expert witness\u2019 is that experts can offer opinions beyond the facts of what they have personally witnessed and can respond to questions about hypothetical situations posed to them. Hostile witness is a person who willfully or with motive (bribe/intimidation) conceals part of the truth or tells a lie or gives completely false evidence in a court. It is contradictory to the statement the witness made in the previous deposition (e.g. statement recorded by the police). Any of the above two witnesses can be declared hostile witnesses. S.No. Feature Common witness Expert witness 1. Definition Gives evidence about the facts observed or perceived by him (Sec. 118 IEA) Person especially skilled in foreign law, science or art (Sec. 45 IEA) 2. Volunteering a statement Not allowed Can volunteer 3. Drawing an inference from observations Not allowed Can draw 4. Expressing an opinion on observations made by others Not allowed Can express 5. Responsibility Less Highly Responsible 6. Punishment for giving false evidence Less punishment Severely punished in some countries 7. Conduct money Cannot claim Can claim 8. Examples Any person Handwriting or fingerprint expert, doctor, chemical examiner A leading question is one which suggests to the witness the answer desired, or which includes a material fact and admits of a conclusive answer by a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\". Leading questions are allowed only during cross-examination. They are defined under 141IEA. Leading questions are not permitted in the chief examination. For hostile witnesses, leading questions can be asked by the defence lawyer during the chief examination. Expert witness or skilled witness- opinion obtained from a qualified person. Eg. doctor, firearm expert, fingerprint expert, serologist.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. An expert witness can claim for conduct money. Conduct money is the fee offered or paid to a witness in civil cases, at the time of serving the summons to meet the expenses for attending the Court. In criminal cases, conveyance charges and daily allowance can be claimed by the expert witness according to Government rules. Option: C. A common witness cannot volunteer a statement in between the proceedings in the court, only an expert witness can volunteer statements. Option: D. Leading questions are allowed only during cross-examination. They are defined under 141IEA. Leading questions are not permitted in the chief examination.
