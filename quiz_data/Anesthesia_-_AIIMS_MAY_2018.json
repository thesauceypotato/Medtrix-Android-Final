In a baby with delayed transition (Poor tone or no cry), the initial steps of resuscitation are Warmth Position the neck to open the airway Clear secretions from airway (if needed) Dry Stimulate Warmth Place baby in warmer, maintain temperature between 36.5\u201337.5\u00b0C. Position to open airway Position the baby in supine with head and neck neutral or extended in \u201csniffing the air position\u201d using a shoulder roll under shoulder blades to open the airway, avoid hyperextension and flexion of neck. Clearing the   secretions Clear secretions from airway only if the baby is gasping and has a poor tone. A gentle suction is done in mouth before the nose to ensure that there is nothing for the newborn to aspirate even if he gasps when nose is suctioned. Remember M comes before N. Dry Wet skin increases evaporative loss, so dry the baby gently if there is any fluid and discard the first towel. Stimulation If the respiration is not adequate with the above steps, a brief tactile stimulation by gently rubbing back, trunk or extremities should be tried before initiating positive pressure ventilation (PPV).</p>\n<p></p>",

General practice is to record a \u201cT\u201d (for \u201cintubated\u201d) next to the verbal score and the total score for patients whose verbal axis cannot be assessed because of intubation. No single GCS score defines a cutoff for coma, however, 90% of patients with GCS \u22648 and none with GCS \u22659 meet the above definition of coma. Thus, GCS \u22648 is a generally accepted operational definition of coma. Glasgow coma scale 1 (recommended for age >4 years) Points Best eye opening Best verbal Best motor 6 \u2013 \u2013 Obeys 5 \u2013 Oriented Localizes pain 4 Spontaneous Confused Withdraws to pain 3 To speech Inappropriate Flexion (decorticate) 2 To pain Incomprehensible Extensor (decerebrate) 1 None None None Technically, this is a scale of impaired consciousness, whereas \u201ccoma\u201d implies unresponsiveness Range of total points: 3 (worst) to 15 (normal) When testing eye opening to pain, use peripheral stimulus (the grimace associated with central pain may cause eye closure) If no motor response, important to exclude, spinal cord transaction Mild disability (13\u201315): Moderate disability (9\u201312): Loss of consciousness greater than 30 minutes Physical or cognitive impairments which may or may not resolve Benefit from rehabilitation Severe disability (3\u20138): Coma: unconscious state. 0 meaningful response, no voluntary activities Vegetative state (less than 3): Sleep wake cycles Arousal, but no interaction with environment No localized response to pain Persistent vegetative state: Vegetative state lasting longer than one month Brain death: No brain functions Specific criteria needed for making this diagnosis</p>\n<p></p>",

LMA Indications: LMA is commonly used during general anesthesia for various surgical procedures. It is useful in situations where intubation is not feasible or is not required, such as in spontaneously breathing patients. Advantages of LMA: It is easier and quicker to insert compared to endotracheal intubation. It can be used in patients with a potentially difficult airway. It causes less trauma to the airway and vocal cords. Disadvantages and Limitations: The LMA may not provide as secure an airway as endotracheal intubation, particularly for longer surgical procedures. It is not suitable for patients with a risk of regurgitation and aspiration (e.g., patients with full stomachs). It is not suitable for patients who require positive-pressure ventilation at high pressures.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A, B, D- Definite airway means ventilating the patient with a tube in trachea which may be endotracheal tube (oral or nasal) or tracheostomy tube.</p>\n<p></p>",

This causes the patient not only to be dissociated from surroundings he/she gets dissociated from himself or herself. Ketamine indication in various medical condition: Ketamine Indication Description Anesthesia and Sedation Used as an anesthetic agent for surgical procedures, particularly in cases where rapid induction and emergence are required. - It's used in emergency and trauma settings for procedural sedation (e.g., reduction of dislocated joints). Analgesia Ketamine is employed for pain management, especially in situations where traditional pain relief methods are insufficient or contraindicated. - It's used for acute and chronic pain conditions, such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and neuropathic pain. Depression and Mood Disorders Ketamine has shown promise in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) in some individuals.Administered intravenously as part of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Investigational use of ketamine in combination with psychotherapy for individuals with PTSD. Acute Agitation and Excited Delirium Used in emergency medicine to manage severe agitation and excited delirium, particularly in cases involving synthetic cathinones (\"bath salts\") or stimulant overdose. Induction of General Anesthesia in Pediatrics Ketamine is often used for the induction of anesthesia in pediatric patients due to its safety profile and minimal impact on respiratory function. Bronchodilation In certain cases of severe asthma or bronchospasm not responding to standard treatment, ketamine may be used to provide bronchodilation and improve airflow. Intracranial Hypertension Ketamine's cerebral vasodilatory effect can be useful in managing intracranial hypertension, such as in traumatic brain injury (TBI) or increased intracranial pressure (ICP).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options: B, C, and D.

One of the major advantages of second generation LMA is they have separate tube for gastric deflation. Suction tube is passed through this tube, which through the hole (shown by arrow in image) enters the esophagus to deflate the stomach. Therefore, this hole should lie just above the esophagus. Indications: The ProSeal LMA is indicated for use in anesthesia and airway management during surgical procedures, particularly when a higher seal pressure and gastric protection are required. Advantages of the ProSeal LMA: Enhanced seal pressure compared to the classic LMA, making it suitable for positive-pressure ventilation at higher pressures. Passive gastric drainage to reduce the risk of aspiration. Reduced risk of air leakage around the cuff , providing better control of ventilation. Suitable for a wide range of surgical and diagnostic procedure s, including laparoscopic surgery. Disadvantages and Limitations: The ProSeal LMA may require more skill and experience for proper insertion compared to the classic LMA. It may not be suitable for patients with anatomical variatio ns or those who require a very small-sized airway device .
