      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1, 2, 3 and 5 only Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings are dark rings that appear to encircle the iris of the eye. They are due to copper deposition in part of the Descemet's membrane as a result of liver diseases. The rings , which consist of copper deposits where the cornea meets the sclera, in Descemet's membrane , first appear as a crescent at the top of the cornea. Eventually, a second crescent forms below, at the \" six o'clock position \", and ultimately completely encircles the cornea. Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings are seen in most of the patients with neurologic involvement from Wilson However, it may not be seen in approximately 5% of these patients. They are present in only 50% of the patients with isolated hepatic involvement and in pre-symptomatic patients. Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings may be absent in patients with fulminant disease and in most children. The combination of neurological symptoms, a low blood ceruloplasmin level and KF rings is diagnostic of Wilson's disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings are caused by deposition of excess copper on the inner surface of the cornea in the Descemet membrane extending to the trabecular meshwork. Copper is deposited as a granular complex with sulfur which gives a ring its characteristic color. It is to be noted that copper is present throughout the cornea, however, due to fluid streaming, copper tends to accumulate superiorly and inferiorly, before involving the iris circumferentially. Copper can also be deposited in the lens in the anterior and posterior capsule causing sunflower cataracts which have radiating centrifugal extensions. Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings typically disappear with treatment and reappear with disease progression. When present, it is a useful clinical sign to monitor treatment compliance. The rings disappear with chelation therapy over three to five years in up to 80% of patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Other causes of KF rings are:- cholestasis (obstruction of the bile ducts), Primary biliary cirrhosis cryptogenic cirrhosis(cirrhosis in which no cause can be identified). Deposition of excess copper in the basal ganglia in the brain leads to the neurologic and psychiatric manifestations of Wilson disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Diagnostic Criteria For Wilson Disease:- Test Parameter Score Typical clinical signs and symptoms Kayser-Fleischer rings Present 2 Absent 0 Neurological symptoms Severe 2 Mild 1 Absent 0 Serum ceruloplasmin Normal (>0.2 g per litre) 0 0.1-0.2 g per litre 1 <0.1 g per litre 2 Coombs-negative haemolytic anaemia Present 1 Absent 0 Other tests Liver copper (in the absence of cholestasis) >250 \u00b5g (>4 \u03bcmol) g' dry weight 2 50-249 \u00b5g (0.8-4 \u03bcmol) g\u00b9 1 Normal: <50 \u00b5g (<0.8 \u03bcmol) -1 Rhodanine-positive granules 1 Urinary copper (in the absence of acute hepatitis) Normal 0 1-2\u00d7ULN 1 >2\u00d7ULN 2 Normal but>5xULN after D-penicillamine 2 Mutation analysis On both chromosomes detected 4 On one chromosome detected 1 No mutations detected 0 Total score Evaluation 24 Diagnosis established 3 Diagnosis possible; more tests needed Diagnosis very unlikely</p>\n<p></p>",
