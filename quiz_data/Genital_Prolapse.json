She also complains of a sensation of a bulge against her undergarments. There is significant past medical history suggestive of stage III endometrial carcinoma, now in remission, for which she received radiotherapy to her pelvis. She has 15 pack-year history of smoking. On further questioning, she described that at times she needs to use her finger to \u201cpush against the bulge\u201d to achieve a bowel movement. On inspection, a mucosal outpouching is seen protruding from the vaginal opening. Upon transillumination of the protrusion, characteristic shadows were identified within the mucosal sac. On physical examination, the defect observed is most likely associated with the prolapse of the small bowel into the space normally occupied by the posterior vaginal wall between which pair of ligaments?",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Uterosacral ligaments The case explains the features of pelvic organ prolapse and enterocele . Smoking and radiation exposure are risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse. Enterocele is the prolapse of the small intestine into the pouch of Douglas.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Posteriorly, between the lower portion of the vagina and the rectum, similar tissues together form the rectovaginal septum. Covered by the peritoneum, uterosacral ligaments form the lateral boundaries of the pouch of Douglas. The pelvic diaphragm consists of the levator ani. It consists of 3 muscles: Puborectalis, pubococcygeus, and iliococcygeus. The main ligaments that support the uterus are the uterosacral ligaments, the cardinal ligaments, and pubocervical ligament.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. The round ligament originates somewhat below and anterior to the origin of the fallopian tubes . Each round ligament extends laterally and down into the inguinal canal, through which it passes, to terminate in the upper portion of the ipsilateral labium majus. Sampson artery, a branch of the uterine artery, runs within this ligament. Round ligaments provide no substantial support to the uterus and have very little role in prolapse. Option: B. The cardinal ligament-also called the transverse cervical ligament or Mackenrodt ligament -anchors medially to the uterus and upper vagina. It is one of the major ligamentous supports of the uterus and its injury predisposes to prolapse. But the enterocele descent is between the uterosacral ligaments which form the boundaries of the pouch of Douglas. Option: D . Sacrospinous ligaments extend from the sacrum to the ischial spine. It is closely related to the pudendal nerve and hence is clinically used as a landmark in pudendal block . But these ligaments provide no support to pelvic structures and are not related to prolapse or enterocele.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Cystocele: Herniation of the upper 2/3rd anterior vaginal wall and overlying bladder base into the vaginal lumen.

The remnant of the mesonephric duct is known as the Gartner duct. GDCs are usually located along the anterior and lateral parts of the vaginal wall and, rarely, on the posterolateral wall. The remaining Gartner ducts are identified in approximately 25% of all adult individuals with vaginas; however, only 1% will develop Gartner duct cysts.

In cases of abscess formation, both marsupialization of the sac and incision with drainage, as well as appropriate antibiotics , are accepted modes of therapy.

Remaining Gartner ducts are identified in approximately 25% of all adult individuals with vaginas; however, only 1% will develop Gartner duct cysts.
