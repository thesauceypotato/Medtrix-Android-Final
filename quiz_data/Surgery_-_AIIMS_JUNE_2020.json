Absent bowel sounds and rigidity with features of hypotension and tachycardia suggest Imaging in Peritonitis: Erect chest radiograph to demonstrate free subdiaphragmatic gas. A supine radiograph of the abdomen may confirm the presence of dilated gas-filled loops of the bowel (consistent with a paralytic ileus ) and occasionally show other gas-filled structures that may aid diagnosis, e.g., biliary tree; the fecal pattern may act as a guide to colonic disease (absent in sites of significant inflammation, e.g., diverticulitis ). In a patient who is too ill for an \u2018erect\u2019 film, a lateral decubitus film can show gas beneath the abdominal wall (if CT is unavailable). Multiplanar computed tomography (CT) is increasingly used to identify the cause of peritonitis and may also influence management decisions, e.g., surgical strategy. Abundant recently published evidence supports its use in managing acute abdominal pain. [It is the investigation of choice] Ultrasound scanning has undoubted value in certain situations, such as pelvic peritonitis in females and localized right upper quadrant peritonism.

The plasma volume must be restored and electrolyte concentrations corrected. Fluid balance should be monitored, and pre-existent and ongoing losses fixed. Special cardiac, pulmonary, and renal support measures may be needed, especially if septic shock is present, including central venous pressure monitoring in patients with concurrent disease. Urinary catheterization \u00b1 gastrointestinal decompression A urinary catheter will guide central perfusion and will be required if abdominal surgery is to proceed. A nasogastric tube is commonly passed to allow drainage \u00b1 aspiration until the paralytic ileus has resolved. Antibiotic therapy Administration of parenteral broad-spectrum (aerobic and anaerobic) antibiotics prevents the multiplication of bacteria and the release of endotoxins. Analgesia The patient should be nursed in the sitting-up position and relieved of pain before and after the operation. If appropriate expertise is available, epidural infusion may provide excellent analgesia. Freedom from pain allows early mobilization and adequate physiotherapy in the postoperative period, which helps to prevent basal pulmonary collapse, deep-vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.

There is evidence that sphincterotomy and bile duct clearance can reduce the incidence of infectious complications in these patients. Sphincterotomy should be carried out in patients with cholangitis, or a biliary stent should be placed to drain the duct. ERCP is an invasive procedure and carries a small risk of worsening pancreatitis. Therefore, when there is no cholangitis, ERCP is not indicated. American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy \u2014 Several points related to ERCP were summarized in guidelines published by the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE). The guideline notes that ERCP is generally indicated in the following: The jaundiced patient is suspected of having biliary obstruction (appropriate therapeutic maneuvers should be performed during the procedure). The patient without jaundice whose clinical and biochemical or imaging data suggest pancreatic duct or biliary tract disease. Evaluation of signs or symptoms suggesting pancreatic malignancy when results of direct imaging (g., endoscopic ultrasound [EUS], ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) are equivocal or normal. Acute biliary pancreatitis with concomitant cholangitis or biliary obstruction. Evaluation of pancreatitis of unknown etiology. Preoperative evaluation of the patient with chronic pancreatitis and Evaluation of the sphincter of Oddi by manometry in patients with suspected type II SOD. Sphincter of Oddi manometry is not required for patients with type I SOD (empiric sphincterotomy is appropriate in these patients).

Ampullectomy of adenomatous neoplasms of the major papilla. Therapy of disorders of the biliary and pancreatic ducts. Facilitation of cholangioscopy and ERCP is generally not indicated in the following: Evaluation of abdominal pain of obscure origin without objective findings suggesting biliary or pancreatic disease. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and EUS are safe diagnostic procedures that can prevent the need for ERCP.

Initial management of the patient with gastrointestinal perforation includes intravenous (IV) fluid therapy, cessation of oral intake, and broad-spectrum antibiotics . Drainage, gastrostomy, and feeding jejunostomy may be appropriate depending on the perforation level. Monitoring should initially take place in an intensive care unit. The intravenous proton pump inhibitors administration suits those suspected of upper gastrointestinal perforation. Patients with intestinal perforation can have severe volume depletion. The severity of any electrolyte abnormalities depends upon the nature and volume of material leaking from the gastrointestinal tract.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dilated large bowel with Haustrations The valvulae conniventes, also known as Kerckring folds/valves, plicae circulares , or just small bowel folds, are the mucosal folds of the small intestine , starting from the second part of the duodenum. They are large and thick at the jejunum and considerably decrease in size distally in the ileum to disappear entirely in the distal ileal bowel loops. They result in a classical appearance on abdominal radiographs, barium studies, and CT scans. The haustral folds (Latin: haustrum, plural: haustra) represent folds of mucosa within the colon. The haustra refer to the small segmented pouches of the bowel separated by the haustral folds. They are formed by circumferential contraction of the inner muscular layer of the colon. The outer longitudinal muscular layer is organized into three bands (taeniae coli) which run from the cecum to the rectum. These athletic bands and the elongated serosal fat saccules (appendices epiploic ae) aid in identifying the colon within the peritoneal cavity.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Radiological  features  of obstruction (on plain X-ray) The obstructed small bowel is characterized by straight segments that are generally central and lie transversely. No/ minimal gas is seen in the colon. The jejunum is characterized by its valvulae conniventes , which pass entirely across the width of the bowel and are regularly spaced, giving a \u2018Concertina\u2019 or ladder effect . Ileum \u2013Wangensteen has piquantly described the distal ileum as featureless Caecum \u2013 a distended caecum is shown by a rounded gas shadow in the right iliac fossa The large bowel , except for the caecum, shows haustral folds , which, unlike valvule conniventes, are spaced irregularly, do not cross the whole diameter of the bowel, and do not have indentations placed opposite one another. Features of obstruction: In high small bowel obstruction, vomiting occurs early, is profuse, and causes rapid dehydration. Distension is minimal, with little evidence of dilated small bowel loops on abdominal radiography. In low small bowel obstruction, pain is predominant with central distension. Vomiting is delayed. Multiple dilated small bowel loops are seen on radiography. In significant bowel obstruction, distension and pronounced. Pain is less severe, and vomiting and dehydration are later features. The colon is proximal to the block and is distended on abdominal radiography. The small bowel will be dilated if the ileocaecal valve is incompetent. Small bowel obstruction predominantly has bilious vomiting, whereas it is rare in the large bowel.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Large bowel obstruction Significant bowel obstruction(LBO) can be classified as dynamic (mechanical) or adynamic (pseudo-obstruction). Mechanical obstruction occurs due to blockage of the large bowel, resulting in increased intestinal contractility. Conversely, pseudo-obstruction is characterized by the absence of intestinal contractility, often associated with decreased or absent motility of the small bowel and stomach. Colorectal cancer is the most common cause of LBO , with rectal cancer being more common than sigmoid. Adhesions , which are the most common cause of small bowel obstruction , are rarely a cause of colonic obstruction. In LBO , the colon becomes distended as gas, stool, and liquid accumulate proximal to the site of the Vascular compromise of the obstructed colon can occur due to excessive enlargement, leading to necrosis and perforation. Clinical features of LBO include failure to pass stool and flatus associated with increasing abdominal distention and cramping abdominal pain. An abdominal X-ray can reveal a distended colon , while a CT scan can help show an inflammatory process such as diverticulitis. A water-soluble contrast enema can diagnose suspected cases of volvulus or distal sigmoid cancer. Virtually all patients with complete acute significant bowel obstruction require prompt surgical intervention and should not undergo a trial of non-operative management. Acute significant bowel obstruction in patients with a competent ileocecal valve is a true surgical emergency because of the high chances of perforation, with the cecum being the most common site. Once the diagnosis has been made, surgical exploration should be undertaken as soon as possible after appropriate resuscitation.</p>\n<p></p>",

For lobectomy , the thyroid isthmus is divided, and the lobe to be removed is dissected. The strap muscles are divided to provide greater exposure to the gland but are usually preserved to maintain neck function.

The motor innervation to the perioral musculature uniformly is from the seventh cranial nerve. The facial nerve has temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, and cervical branches. The buccal and marginal branches primarily supply innervation to the perioral musculature. Skandalakis described partial innervation of depressor muscles by an anterior ramus of the cervical branch of the facial nerve in addition to the primary marginal branch innervation. Dingman and Grabb reported that in 100 dissections, the mandibular branches were superior to the mandibular border and anterior to the facial artery. In contrast, Nelson and Gingrass found that multiple branches ascending from below the mandibular border provided frequent innervation to the lip depressors. Nelson believed that any branch supplying the lip depressors should be classified as a mandibular branch instead of Skandalakis' classification. Hence, the best answer would be a marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve. But as it is not in the options, the next best answer is a cervical branch of the facial nerve.

In some cases, gallbladder dysfunction creates pain, even in the absence of stones. These patients will have other diagnoses excluded by CT and upper endoscopy and should undergo a CCK-stimulated HIDA scan, in which the radiolabeled iminodiacetic acid will collect in the gallbladder. The patient is given an IV dose of CCK, and the percentage ejection of the gallbladder in response to CCK is calculated. An ejection fraction less than one-third at 20 minutes after CCK administration in patients without stones is considered diagnostic of dyskinesia, which should be managed with cholecystectomy. The symptoms of dyskinesia are fairly responsive to cholecystectomy, with more than 85% of patients showing improvement or resolution . In nonresponders, ERCP with sphincterotomy may prove useful Therefore, USG has no role in the diagnosis of biliary dyskinesia Hepatic Iminodiacetic Acid Scan (HIDA Scan): Although incapable of providing any precise anatomic delineation, biliary scintigraphy, also known as a hepatic iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan, can be used to evaluate the physiologic secretion of bile. The injection of iminodiacetic acid, which is processed in the liver and secreted with bile, allows the identification of bile flow. Therefore, the failure to fill the gallbladder 2 hours after injection demonstrates cystic duct obstruction, as seen in acute cholecystitis. In addition, the scan will identify obstruction of the biliary tree and bile leaks, which may be useful in the postoperative setting. HIDA scans can also be used to determine gallbladder function because the injection of CCK during a scan will document physiologic ejection of the gallbladder . This may be useful in patients with biliary tract pain but without stones because some patients have pain from impaired emptying, known as biliary dyskinesia . As a nuclear medicine test, the test demonstrates physiologic flow but does not provide fine anatomic detail, nor can it identify gallstones.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Milwaukee classification of the sphincter of Oddi (SOD) dysfunction. 1.
