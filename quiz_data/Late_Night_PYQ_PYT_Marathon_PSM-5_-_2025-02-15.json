A) Niacin</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Casal's necklace is a characteristic dermatitis seen in niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency, which leads to a condition called pellagra. Niacin can be synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan, with 60 mg of tryptophan converting to 1 mg of niacin daily. Tryptophan deficiency is common in maize-based diets, but the actual reason for pellagra in maize eaters is not tryptophan deficiency itself, but rather an excess of leucine, which prevents the conversion of tryptophan to niacin. Leucine is therefore known as the pellagrogenic amino acid of India.</li><li>\u2022 Pellagra is characterized by the \"4 D's\": diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death. The dermatitis associated with pellagra often occurs around the neck or on the extremities of the body, particularly on areas of skin that are directly exposed to sunlight. When this dermatitis occurs around the neck, it may lead to the formation of Casal's necklace.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.
