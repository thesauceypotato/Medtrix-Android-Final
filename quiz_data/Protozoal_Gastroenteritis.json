Entamoeba coli is a non-pathogenic species of entamoeba that frequently exists as a commensal parasite in the human GI tract. It may lead to gastritis, dyspepsia, hyperacidity, and indigestion. Option C. Giardia lamblia is the causative agent of giardiasis and is the only common protozoan found in the duodenum and jejunum of humans. Symptoms are malaise, weakness, weight loss, and abdominal cramps. Stools may be watery, semi-solid, greasy, bulky, and foul-smelling. Option D. vaginalis is sexually transmitted, and most infections are asymptomatic or mild in both men and women. In women the infection is normally limited to the vulva, vagina, and cervix; it does not usually extend to the uterus.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Balantidium coli has two developmental stages, a trophozoite stage and a cyst stage. In trophozoites, the two nuclei are visible. The macronucleus is long and sausage-shaped, and the spherical micronucleus is nested next to it, often hidden by the macronucleus.</p>\n<p></p>",

Trophozoite: vegetative stage, pear-shaped (monkey-faced appearance), 10-20x6-15mm, convex dorsal surface, 2 axostyles, 2 nuclei, four pairs of flagella. Multiply by binary fission, motile (falling leaf motility) Cyst: oval, 8-14x6-10mm, four nuclei, axostyle Source of infection: humans, the infective stage is a cyst, through contaminated food & water Life cycle: excystation in the duodenum, trophozoites attach to the intestinal villi & multiply by binary fission Option A and B. Clinical features: asymptomatic mostly, diarrhea with abdominal pain, malabsorption syndrome. Option D. Laboratory diagnosis: Faecal examination: cysts & trophozoites Duodenal aspirate: trophoziotes (enterotest) Duodenal or jejunal biopsy Antigen detection in stool: ELISA, Counter Immune-Electro-Osmophoresis CIEP, immunofluorescence.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hymenolepis nana nana is the smallest cestode infecting man and also known as the dwarf tapeworm. It is the only cestode that can complete its life cycle in one host. The eggs are spherical or oval having two distinct membranes-outer membrane and inner embryophore. Two polar filaments arise from either end of the embryo here.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Ingestion of parasite eggs on fecally contaminated food or fomites allows the initial infection. Once in the intestine, the eggs hatch to form oncospheres , which penetrate the mucosa to encyst as cysticercoid Four or 5 days later, the larval cyst ruptures into the lumen to form the relatively small, adult H. nana tapeworm (15 to 50\u202fmm in length). Internal autoinfection may occur as parasite eggs are released from gravid proglottids in the ileum. In addition, poor sanitary practices promote external (fecal-oral) autoinfection as well as transmission to others sharing the same living quarters</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A, B, and C.
