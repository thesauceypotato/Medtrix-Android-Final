There may be pink patches on the cheeks, chin and nose. The extremities may be cyanosed. Oedema may be seen in the feet and lower legs. PM's lividity is bright INTERNAL FINDINGS The appearances are not characteristic. The subcutaneous tissues are relatively avascular. Ice crystals can be found in blood vessels, the heart and interstitial tissue spaces. The blood is often bright red due to oxygen retention by haemoglobin at low temperatures. The stomach mucosa is studded with numerous brown-black acute erosions, ulcerations and haemorrhages similar to those seen in many types of pre-death stress. A variable degree of fat necrosis of the pancreas is seen in about 50% of cases. Areas of stiff, yellow fat necrosis are seen in the pancreas and adjacent areas of omentum and mesentery. Pulmonary oedema and microinfarcts in many organs are common. Perivascular haemorrhages in the brain and small infarcts in the heart 3. are Internal organs are congested.</p>\n<p></p>",

THE HIDE-AND-DIE SYNDROME /Terminal burrowing behaviour In some cases of hypothermic death, the disoriented, dying hypothermia victim, who, while attempting to protect himself from the cold, may hide in corners, in cupboards or under piles of furniture or household goods. More commonly, a naked or partly clothed old person is found amid a scene of utter confusion with furniture pulled over and drawers and cupboards emptied, but the disturbance is at a low level, and the tops of tables, etc., are not disturbed. This may lead to suspicion of homicide and robbery. Outdoors, he may attempt to burrow into the snow, bush, or other constituents of the environment. The signs of hypothermia are usually found. The problem arises as to whether the victim became hypothermic first, which leads to mental confusion causing strange behaviour, or whether, due to some mental aberration, the person began behaving abnormally. Option: C. RECIPROCAL OR PARADOXICAL UNDRESSING: This abnormal condition is seen in accidental hypothermia, particularly in old persons. In this, people take off some or all of their clothing. The cause of the condition is not known. It may be due to prolonged exposure to severe cold-producing paralysis of the thermal regulatory mechanism. This results in the failure of vasoconstriction of arterioles of the skin, which results in a blood flow from the body's core, thus giving an exaggerated sensation of warmth. Terminal hallucinations occur. Because of the significant discomfort, the person may undress. In such cases, there may be suspicion of a sexual</p>\n<p></p>",

The term thermic fever or \"sunstroke\" is used when there has been direct exposure to the sun. Predisposing factors: High temperature, increased humidity, minor infections, muscular activity and lack of acclimatisation are the principal factors in the initiation. Where there is 100 per cent humidity, a temperature of 32\u00b0C in the environment may lead to heat stroke. Other factors are old age, pre-existing disease, alcoholism, use of significant tranquillisers, obesity, lack of air movement and unsuitable clothing. Failure of cutaneous blood flow and sweating, which control body temperature, leads to a breakdown of the heat-regulating centre of the hypothalamus.</p>\n<p></p>",

These markings have a general pattern resembling the branches of a tree. This fern-like pattern of erythema in the skin is usually found over the shoulders or the flanks. It appears within a few minutes to one hour of an accident. Mechanism: The mechanism by which this pattern occurs has yet to be discovered. It may be caused due to the slight staining of the tissues by haemoglobin from lysed red blood cells along the path of the electric current or rupture of smaller blood vessels at several places giving rise to ecchymoses. They may be superficial bums producing mere erythema of skin which indicates the path taken by the current. They are also said to be due to minute depositions of copper in the dermis or from boiling the intercellular fluid following the fascial planes. They indicate the paths taken by the discharge and disappear in one to two days if the person survives. Red streaks following skin creases or sweat-damped tracks are more likely</p>\n<p></p>",

Multiple individuals and confluent areas of third-degree burn are seen. 1000 volts will jump several mm, and 100 kilovolts about 35 cm. Very high voltage currents produce massive tissue destruction with loss of extremities and rupture of organs. When bone is involved, the periosteum may be elevated, superficial layers of the bone may be destroyed, or fracture may occur. High tension electrical currents may produce multiple, small, discrete, pitted burns due to arcing from the conductor to the body without direct contact. Multiple burnt or punched-out lesions are produced due to the arc dancing over the body surface over large areas, which present 'crocodile flash burns'. Flashover often produces 'arc eye'. High amperage has an explosive blast-like effect and may produce injuries resembling bullet, stab or incised wounds.</p>\n<p></p>",

The water required for the hydrolysis is obtained mainly from the body tissues, which therefore become increasingly In a body immersed in water, this fluid contributes to the hydrolysis of the subcutaneous fat. Still, the formation of adipocere in deeper sites starts before the extraneous water enters the body's interior. Activation of lipid peroxidation is a significant component of the mechanism (Manulik eta! 1999). Adipocere is delayed by cold and hastened by heat. A warm, moist, anaerobic environment favours adipocere formation. It is more frequently seen in females, well-nourished mature newborn children, the obese and corpses that have been submerged in water for a long period. It is also seen in buried bodies. Foetuses under seven months do not show this change. The bodies enclosed in a water-tight coffin for many years may be converted to adipocere even without external water.</p>\n<p></p>",

INTERNAL: The appearances are not characteristic. The subcutaneous tissues are relatively avascular. Ice crystals can be found in blood vessels, the heart and interstitial tissue spaces. The blood is often bright red due to oxygen retention by haemoglobin at low temperatures. The stomach mucosa is studded with numerous brown-black acute erosions, ulcerations and haemorrhages similar to those seen in many types of pre-death stress. A variable degree of fat necrosis of the pancreas is seen in about 50% of case Areas of stiff, yellow fat necrosis are seen in the pancreas and adjacent areas of omentum and mesentery.
