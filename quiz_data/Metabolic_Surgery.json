Linear stapling devices are used. There is variation in the techniques employed between how wide the staplers should be and whether reinforcement strips should be used. The Achilles heel of the sleeve is the risk of a staple line leak at the angle of His, which can take months to heal owing to the high-pressure system in the stomach with an intact pylorus.
