      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Chronic infection of Fasciola hepatica can cause hepatocellular carcinoma Fasciola hepatica is a liver fluke that can cause cholecystitis and cholangitis. It is not associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Clonorchis sinensis is an inhabitant of the bile duct & is associated with Cholangiocarcinoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Immature eggs are discharged in the biliary ducts and passed in the stool. Eggs become embryonated in freshwater over ~2 weeks; Embryonated eggs release miracidia, which invade a suitable snail intermediate host. In the snail, the parasites undergo several developmental stages (sporocysts, rediae, and cercariae). The cercariae are released from the snail and encyst as metacercariae on aquatic vegetation or other substrates. Humans and other mammals become infected by ingesting metacercariae-contaminated greenery (e.g., watercress). After ingestion, the metacercariae exocyst in the duodenum penetrates through the intestinal wall into the peritoneal cavity. The immature flukes then migrate through the liver parenchyma into biliary ducts, where they mature into adult flukes and produce eggs. In humans, maturation from metacercariae into adult flukes usually takes about 3\u20134 months; the development of F. gigantica may take longer than F. hepatica .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. paragonimus westermani infection presences endemic hemoptysis. Option: C. Schistosoma is a trematode that lays nonoperculated eggs. Option: D. Schistosoma has only one intermediate host, unlike other trematodes & it is diecious unlike other trematodes, which are monoecious</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The standard way to be sure a person is infected with Fasciola is by seeing the parasite. This is usually done by finding Fasciola eggs in stool (fecal) specimens examined under a microscope. More than one specimen may need to be examined to find the parasite.</p>\n<p></p>",
