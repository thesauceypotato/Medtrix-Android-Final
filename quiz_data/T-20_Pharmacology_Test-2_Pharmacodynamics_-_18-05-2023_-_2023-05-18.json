These are two different substances. GH acts on enzymatic receptors whereas GHRH acts on GPCR.</li><li>\u2022 Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) acts by binding to its specific G protein-coupled receptor (GHRH receptor) on the surface of pituitary cells. This binding activates a G protein, which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase. The activation of adenylyl cyclase increases the levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) within the cell, leading to the activation of protein kinase A (PKA).

Acetylation plays a significant role in the metabolism of isoniazid, and variations in acetylation rates can impact its therapeutic efficacy and side effects. Hydralazine (Choice B), an antihypertensive drug, is also metabolized by acetylation. Acetylation is a major pathway involved in the elimination of hydralazine from the body. Procainamide (Choice C), an antiarrhythmic medication, undergoes extensive acetylation for its metabolism. Acetylation is a major metabolic pathway for procainamide, and acetylator phenotype variations can affect the drug's efficacy and potential toxicity.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. D. Highly selective drug</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The fact that dose response curves of salbutamol for tachycardia and bronchodilation are widely separated on the dose axis suggests that salbutamol has a high degree of selectivity. This means that salbutamol can achieve its desired therapeutic effect (bronchodilation) at a dose that is significantly lower than the dose required to produce an adverse effect (tachycardia). Selectivity is a desirable property in drugs as it allows for effective treatment with minimal side effects.</li><li>\u2022 The graph above illustrates the dose-response curves of salbutamol for bronchodilation and tachycardia. The blue curve represents the bronchodilation response, while the red curve represents the tachycardia response.</li><li>\u2022 Bronchodilation Response : The curve shows that a lower dose of salbutamol (around 2 mg) is sufficient to achieve a significant bronchodilation effect. Tachycardia Response : The curve shows that a higher dose of salbutamol (around 7 mg) is needed to produce tachycardia.</li><li>\u2022 Bronchodilation Response : The curve shows that a lower dose of salbutamol (around 2 mg) is sufficient to achieve a significant bronchodilation effect.</li><li>\u2022 Bronchodilation Response</li><li>\u2022 Tachycardia Response : The curve shows that a higher dose of salbutamol (around 7 mg) is needed to produce tachycardia.</li><li>\u2022 Tachycardia Response</li><li>\u2022 The wide separation between the effective dose for bronchodilation and the dose causing tachycardia demonstrates the selectivity of salbutamol. This selectivity allows salbutamol to provide the desired therapeutic effect (bronchodilation) at a dose much lower than that required to produce the side effect (tachycardia).</li><li>\u2022 Explanation of Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Explanation of Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Options A. Highly potent bronchodilator</li><li>\u2022 Options A. Highly potent bronchodilator</li><li>\u2022 While salbutamol may be a potent bronchodilator, the separation of the dose response curves specifically indicates selectivity rather than just potency. Potency refers to the amount of drug needed to produce a given effect, but the question focuses on the differential doses required for different effects, indicating selectivity.</li><li>\u2022 Options B. Highly efficacious drug for bradycardia</li><li>\u2022 Options</li><li>\u2022 B. Highly efficacious drug for bradycardia</li><li>\u2022 This option is incorrect. Salbutamol is not used for treating bradycardia. It is a bronchodilator used primarily in the treatment of asthma and other conditions involving bronchospasm. The question does not provide information about the efficacy of salbutamol for bradycardia.</li><li>\u2022 Options C. Highly toxic drug</li><li>\u2022 Options</li><li>\u2022 C. Highly toxic drug</li><li>\u2022 This option is incorrect. While any drug can be toxic at high doses, the separation of the dose response curves indicates that salbutamol can produce its therapeutic effect at a dose much lower than the dose causing tachycardia, suggesting selectivity rather than inherent toxicity.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Understand that a wide separation in the dose response curves of a drug for its therapeutic effect and an adverse effect indicates high selectivity.
