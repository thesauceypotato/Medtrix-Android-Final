      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Countertransference Countertransference refers to the therapist's emotional reactions and unconscious feelings towards the patient that may occur during therapy sessions. It involves the therapist projecting their own unresolved issues or feelings onto the patient.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>It is crucial for therapists to recognize and address their countertransference reactions through supervision, self-reflection, and seeking support when needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Transference: Transference refers to the patient's unconscious redirection of feelings and emotions towards the therapist, often based on past experiences or relationships. Option B. Free association: Free association is a technique in psychoanalysis where the patient spontaneously expresses thoughts and feelings without censorship. Option C. Abreaction: Abreaction refers to the release of repressed emotions or traumatic experiences during therapy, often accompanied by strong emotional expression.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Awareness of countertransference allows therapists to gain insights into their own emotional reactions and use them to better understand the patient's dynamics. Managing countertransference helps maintain professional boundaries and promotes effective treatment outcomes. Catharsis came to mean the lively remembering of a traumatic experience in addition to the emotional release</p>\n<p></p>",

Voyeurism refers to the act of obtaining sexual pleasure from observing others engaging in sexual activity. Option B.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Delirium tremens Ethanol is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, which when stopped, the central nervous system becomes overexcited as the inhibition is taken away. Thus, the body gets an excitatory overload, which results in the symptoms of withdrawal. The severity of symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome is dictated by a number of factors, the most important of which are degree of alcohol intake, length of time the individual has been using alcohol, and previous history of alcohol withdrawal. The patient's history of chronic alcoholism, withdrawal symptoms (uneasiness, clouding of consciousness, insomnia, visual hallucinations), agitation, abusive behavior, and physical symptoms (shaking, profuse sweating) on day 3 are characteristic of DT.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Delirium tremens (DT) is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal syndrome that typically occurs 24-72 hours after cessation or reduction of heavy and prolonged alcohol use. DT is a medical emergency and requires immediate intervention to prevent complications such as seizures and cardiovascular instability. Delirium tremens is the most severe form of withdrawal and occurs in 5 to 20% of patients experiencing detoxification and 1/3 of patients experiencing withdrawal seizures</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Wernicke's encephalopathy: Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterized by the triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia (eye movement abnormalities), and ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movements). Although alcoholics are at risk for Wernicke's encephalopathy, the symptoms described in the case are more consistent with DT. Option C. Korsakoff psychosis: Korsakoff psychosis is characterized by severe memory impairment and confabulation (fabrication of false memories to compensate for gaps in memory). While Korsakoff psychosis can occur as a consequence of Wernicke's encephalopathy, the symptoms described in the case are more suggestive of DT. Option D. Anxiety disorder: The symptoms described in the case, such as clouding of consciousness, visual hallucinations, agitation, and physical symptoms, are not typical of an anxiety disorder. The presence of alcohol withdrawal and specific symptomatology suggests a different diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment for DT to control agitation, prevent seizures, and reduce the risk of delirium-related complications. Thiamine supplementation is crucial in the management of alcohol withdrawal, as thiamine deficiency (seen in alcoholics) can lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome.</p>\n<p></p>",

Bipolar I disorder is primarily distinguished from bipolar II disorder by meeting the criteria for a full manic episode. Conversely, bipolar II disorder must meet criteria for both a hypomanic and a depressed episode. Cyclothymic disorder consists of more chronic mood disturbances that do not meet the full criteria for hypomania, mania, or depression.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and negative symptoms. The given case does not exhibit these features. Option C . Hypomania: Hypomania is a milder form of mania with similar symptoms but less severe. The given case presents with elevated mood, over familiarity, and increased energy, which are characteristic of mania rather than hypomania. Option D. Cyclothymia: Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by at least 2 years (1 year in children and adolescents) of periodic hypomanic and depressive symptoms that are distinct from each other. Neither mood phase, however, ever meets the full criteria for a hypomanic or depressive episode.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Mania can be associated with psychosis, which may include pseudohallucinations, where the person experiences sensory perceptions without the full quality and impact of true hallucinations.
