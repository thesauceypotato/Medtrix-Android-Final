      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Super supraglottic swallow Super supraglottic swallow is not used in post laryngectomy rehabilitation . It is a swallowing manoeuvre that prevents aspiration of food by closing the airway before swallowing. So it is used in management of dysphagia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Supraglottic swallow is advised to protect the airway from aspiration. It is based on the concept of closing the airway before swallowing to prevent aspiration. Steps include: (1) Taking a deep breath, (2) Holding breath, (3) Holding breath while swallowing, (4) Cough voluntarily and immediately after swallowing (clearance of residual food/liquid) It is NOT used in rehab post laryngectomy. After a laryngectomy, the patient won\u2019t be able to talk and communicate, which results in psychological, social and economic trauma. To overcome these various rehabilitation methods like esophageal speech, electronic larynx, tracheoesophageal prosthesis, etc are available.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A- Polite yawning is a nasal airflow inducing manoeuvre; which is based on olfaction rehabilitation after laryngectomy. OPTION C- In TEP, a fistula is created in the thick wall separating the trachea and esophagus surgically. This can be done primarily, at the time of total laryngectomy, or secondarily at weeks or years after total laryngectomy. Several days after the puncturing of the tracheoesophageal wall, a one-way valve prosthesis is placed. It allows exhaled air from lungs to pass into the esophagus when the tracheostomy stoma is closed. This air enters the esophagus and escapes through the mouth during which it induces vibration of the pharyngoesophageal segment for sound production. OPTION D- Esophageal speech involves use of the vibration of esophageal sphincter and subsequent phonation.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma Nasopharyngeal cancer is a rare but aggressive tumor that grows in the upper throat behind the nose, near the base of the skull. It is most common in Southeast Asia, especially in southern China, where it is linked to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and certain dietary and genetic factors. It often causes symptoms such as nosebleeds, hearing loss, ear infections, headaches, and neck lumps, but these may be mistaken for other conditions It is diagnosed by examining the nasopharynx with a flexible scope, taking a biopsy, and doing imaging tests such as MRI or CT scan.

It can seen in the above image and identified by tracing the location of superior turbinate.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Although pneumatization of the middle nasal turbinate has been occasionally reported, pneumatization of the superior and inferior turbinates are very rare finding. A pneumatized superior turbinate is a rare cause of headache. In these cases the superior turbinate is forced anteriorly and inferiorly at the area between the middle turbinate and the nasal septum, leading to intranasal mucosal contact. Nasal endoscopy alone, does not provide us with adequate information for this inaccessible area of the superior nasal cavity. A coronal computed tomography (CT) must be obtained to confirm the diagnosis. Endoscopic surgery may provide permanent relief of the headache.</p>\n<p></p>",
