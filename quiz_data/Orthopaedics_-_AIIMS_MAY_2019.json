      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is common in postmenopausal females, due to reduced levels of estrogens and they are prone for fractures Osteoporosis is the most likely predisposing condition to fracture of the femoral neck. In osteoporosis there is a reduction in bone mass i.e. there is a quantitative decrease in bone formation but has a qualitatively normal configuration.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Osteoporosis In Osteoporosis all the constituents are decrease in a proportionate manner A. According to WHO, it is defined as a bone density that falls 2.5 standard deviation (SD) below the mean for young healthy adults of same sex and referred to as a T score. B. It is characterised by decrease in bone strength especially seen in postmenopausal females and in males with some underlying conditions. The fractures that are most common (in decreasing order) are - vertebral crush fracture, hip (neck femur) and distal end radius fractures (usually colles'). HYP Osteoporosis vs osteomalacia : Osteoporosis is a condition of quantitative decrease in bone mass. (Not qualitative like in osteomalacia where the ratio of unmineralized bone matrix to bone mass is increased, making it a qualitative defect) Etiology: Causes: These are multiple etiological factors responsible for osteoporosis a. Age Related b. Post menopausal c.

It is treated by Extended curettage and autograft. GCT is common in the age of 20-40 years. Note,the most common site of GCT is the distal femoral epiphysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Benign aggressive tumour Giant Cell Tumor (Osteoclastoma) It is epiphyseal lesion seen most commonly around the knee joint (lower femur > upper tibia). Most commonly seen between 20 to 40 years age C. Clinically egg shell cracking sensation is seen in late stage of tumor, sometimes it can present as pulsatile tumor. Rate of malignant transformation is less than 5 to 10%. Histopathological feature: tumor contains two type of cells. The tumor cell kind of cell seen is multinuclear giant cells(not true tumor cells). Treatment: curretage is treatment of choice. Treatment For benign lesions - Simple curettage with bone grafting (autograft/allograft/ artificial bone graft/bone cement) Management of GCT at various locations Around knee: A hemicondylarosteo articular allograft reconstruction or a rotating hingeendoprosthesis may be needed. For distal radius: primary resection with a proximal fibular autograft (arthroplasty / arthrodesis) is done. iii. Lesion at expandable bones like (distal ulna / clavicle or proximal fibula), primary resection is done for in operable lesion like in pelvis / spine radiation or emobilization or both is done. Important point There is risk of sarcomatous changes in lesion treated with irradiation so reserved only for operable lesion. Chemotherapy has limited success. HYP Sandwich technique: In this technique there is insertion of a corticocancellous bridge between the subchondral bone and the cement layer. This is supposed to retard the progression of early cartilage degeneration Newer Modality : Denusumab (Monoclonal antibody against RANK Ligand) is also useful in GCT because RANK-RANL mechanism of bone destruction is considered as an etiology for GCT. Extended curretge is terminology used when curretage is followed up by addition of adjuvants like liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy), phenol, bone cement(PMMA). Large tumors may requires excision, bone grafting, turn o plasty, rarely amputation. Though radiotherapy is not used in benign tumors, in GCT sometimes in surgically inaccessible areas radiotherapy is used.(Other benign tumor exception where radiotherapy is used is Pigmented villonodular synovitis) HYP Giant Cell variants C - Chondromyxoid fibroma C - Chondroblastoma F - Fibrous dysplasia B -Browns tumor A - Aneurysmal bone cyst N -Non ossifying fibroma T -Telangiectasias U - Unicameral bone cyst Osteoclastoma radiologically presents as Eccentric and soap bubble appearance.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA RADIOLOGICAL APPEARANCE TUMORS SUNRAY APPEARANCE /CODMAN\u2019S TRIANGLE OSTEOSARCOMA BUT CAN BE SEEN IN ANY MALIGNANT CONDITION SOAP BUBBLE APPEARANCE GIANT CELL TUMOR ONION PEEL APPEARANCE EWING\u2019S SARCOMA BUT CAN BE SEEN IN ANY MALIGNANT TUMOR GROUND GLASS APPEARANCE/ SHEPHERDS CROOK DEFORMITY FIBROUS DYSPLASIA HOMOGENOUS CALCIFICATION OSTEOGENIC TUMORS FALLEN FRAGMENT SIGN/TRAP DOOR SIGN SIMPLE BONE CYST POLKA DOT SIGN VERTEBRAL HEMANGIOMA MOTH EATEN BONE MULTIPLE MYELOMA WINKING OWL SIGN VERTEBRAL METASTASIS DOUBLE DENSITY SIGN ANEURYSMAL BONE CYST PUNCTATE CALCIFICATION CHONDROBLASTOMA POPCORN CALCIFICATION CHONDROSARCOMA PATCHY CALCIFICATION CHONDROSARCOMA AND CHONDROBLASTOMA</p>\n<p></p>",
