      "explanation": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Pawn ball megakaryocytes are a characteristic morphological finding in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). These abnormal megakaryocytes have separated nuclear lobes instead of the normal single multi-lobated nucleus. The presence of these distinctive megakaryocytes is part of the dysmegakaryopoiesis that occurs in MDS, along with other features like ringed sideroblasts and pseudo-Pelger-Huet neutrophils. These morphological abnormalities reflect the underlying maturation defect at the level of myeloid stem cells that characterizes MDS.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura - This is incorrect. In ITP, megakaryocytes are typically normal or increased in number, but they do not show the characteristic pawn ball morphology. ITP is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by antibody destruction of platelets.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - This is incorrect. TTP is characterized by microthrombi formation due to abnormally large von Willebrand factor multimers. The bone marrow findings in TTP do not typically include pawn ball megakaryocytes.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Chloramphenicol toxicity - This is incorrect. Chloramphenicol toxicity can cause bone marrow suppression and aplasia, but it is not specifically associated with pawn ball megakaryocytes. It tends to cause a general hypocellularity rather than dysplastic changes.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Chloramphenicol toxicity</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Pawn ball megakaryocytes, with their distinctive separated nuclear lobes, are a characteristic morphological finding in myelodysplastic syndromes and reflect the dysplastic changes in megakaryopoiesis that are a hallmark of this group of disorders.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

This antibody is considered diagnostic for the condition, which presents with clinical features that overlap with those of SLE, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis.

Anti-nuclear antibody - While anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) are present in mixed connective tissue disease, they are not specific for this condition. ANAs are found in many autoimmune diseases including SLE, systemic sclerosis, and Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, so their presence alone cannot differentiate mixed connective tissue disease from other connective tissue disorders.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Anti-nuclear antibody</li><li>\u2022 Option B. SCL-70 antibody - SCL-70 antibody (anti-DNA topoisomerase I) is associated with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), particularly the diffuse cutaneous form with increased risk of pulmonary fibrosis and peripheral vascular disease. It is not characteristic of mixed connective tissue disease.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. SCL-70 antibody</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Anti-CCP antibody - Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies are highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis.

It arises from immature retinal cells called retinoblasts. The presence of Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes is a characteristic histopathological feature of retinoblastoma. These rosettes are true rosettes, consisting of a ring of tumor cells surrounding a central lumen, resembling the primitive neuroepithelium.</li><li>\u2022 It is important to distinguish Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes from Homer Wright rosettes, which are pseudo-rosettes. Homer Wright rosettes are characterized by tumor cells arranged around a central neuropil (tangled cell processes) and are seen in various tumors of neuroectodermal origin, such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma.</li><li>\u2022 While retinoblastoma can show both true rosettes (Flexner-Wintersteiner) and pseudo-rosettes (Homer Wright), the presence of true rosettes is more specific for retinoblastoma in the context of an ocular tumor in a young child.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Tachycardia - With large doses of nitrates and significant drops in mean blood pressure, reflex sympathetic stimulation occurs, leading to tachycardia and increased cardiac contractility. This can paradoxically increase cardiac work and potentially precipitate angina. Option D. Tachyphylaxis - Tolerance (tachyphylaxis) to the hemodynamic and anti-ischemic effects of nitrates develops in a dose and duration-dependent manner when they are continuously present in the body.

Lack of secondary sexual development: The absence of functional ovaries leads to a lack of estrogen production, resulting in poor development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast development and pubic hair growth. Webbed neck: A short, wide neck with excess skin folds (webbing) is a common physical feature in Turner syndrome. Widely spaced nipples (shield chest): This is another characteristic physical finding in Turner syndrome, resulting from the altered body proportions.</li><li>\u2022 Delayed puberty and primary amenorrhea: Due to the presence of streak gonads (non-functional ovaries) in Turner syndrome, patients often experience delayed puberty and primary amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods).</li><li>\u2022 Delayed puberty and primary amenorrhea:</li><li>\u2022 Lack of secondary sexual development: The absence of functional ovaries leads to a lack of estrogen production, resulting in poor development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast development and pubic hair growth.</li><li>\u2022 Lack of secondary sexual development:</li><li>\u2022 Webbed neck: A short, wide neck with excess skin folds (webbing) is a common physical feature in Turner syndrome.</li><li>\u2022 Webbed neck:</li><li>\u2022 Widely spaced nipples (shield chest): This is another characteristic physical finding in Turner syndrome, resulting from the altered body proportions.</li><li>\u2022 Widely spaced nipples (shield chest):</li><li>\u2022 The karyotype associated with classic Turner syndrome is 45,X (also written as 45,XO), indicating the presence of only one X chromosome instead of the normal two in females.

A) Infective endocarditis on a rheumatic valve</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The \"fish mouth\" or \"buttonhole\" appearance of the mitral valve is characteristic of chronic rheumatic heart disease, marked by calcification, fibrosis, and commissural fusion. The presence of superimposed vegetations on autopsy indicates infective endocarditis. Rheumatic valves, due to their deformed structure and altered blood flow dynamics, are predisposed to infection, leading to infective endocarditis. This condition is often fatal if left untreated, particularly in patients with underlying cardiac abnormalities.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B : While calcification and fibrosis are the primary changes in rheumatic heart disease, they do not explain the presence of vegetations in this case.</li><li>\u2022 Option B</li><li>\u2022 Option C : Rupture of chordae tendineae is seen in acute mitral regurgitation but is not related to the findings of vegetations and stenosis.</li><li>\u2022 Option C</li><li>\u2022 Option D : Hypertrophy of the left atrial wall occurs as a secondary change due to chronic pressure overload in mitral stenosis but is not the cause of sudden death in this scenario.</li><li>\u2022 Option D</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 In patients with chronic rheumatic heart disease, deformed valves are at high risk for developing infective endocarditis, particularly in the setting of atrial fibrillation or other contributing factors.
