The toxin produced by Vibrio cholerae is the cholera toxin.</li><li>\u2022 The cholera toxin binds to the GM-1 ganglioside receptor on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells.

Becomes more positive</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 In the given clinical scenario, the patient has hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can cause a shift in the resting membrane potential towards a more positive value, increased cell excitability, and impairments in membrane potential changes.</li><li>\u2022 Hyperkalemia can affect the resting membrane potential of cells, including neurons and muscle cells, in the following ways:</li><li>\u2022 Increased Resting Membrane Potential: Normally, the resting membrane potential is around -70 millivolts (mV) in neurons. However, in hyperkalemia, the elevated extracellular potassium concentration can lead to an increased positive charge outside the cell. This positive charge tends to depolarize the cell membrane, shifting the resting membrane potential towards a more positive value. Altered Excitability: The increased resting membrane potential caused by hyperkalemia can make the cell more excitable. It reduces the threshold required for an action potential to be initiated, making the cell more likely to depolarize and generate an action potential even in response to weaker stimuli. Impaired Membrane Potential Changes: Hyperkalemia can interfere with the ability of the cell membrane to depolarize and repolarize properly during an action potential. It reduces the electrochemical gradient for sodium (Na+) entry during depolarization and decreases the driving force for potassium (K+) exit during repolarization. This can result in slower and less efficient propagation of action potentials. Disrupted Ionic Balance: Elevated potassium levels can disrupt the balance of other ions, such as sodium and calcium, which are essential for normal cell function. The altered ionic balance can interfere with the proper functioning of ion channels and other membrane proteins involved in generating and regulating action potentials.</li><li>\u2022 Increased Resting Membrane Potential: Normally, the resting membrane potential is around -70 millivolts (mV) in neurons.

A) Methotrexate with folinic acid</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Methotrexate with folinic acid: This is a clear case of post-molar choriocarcinoma with lung metastases. Treatment is based on prognostication and staging. According to the given scoring system, the parameters such as the time interval since the antecedent pregnancy, beta-hCG levels, and the presence of lung metastases suggest a low-risk choriocarcinoma. For low-risk choriocarcinoma, the recommended treatment is multi-dose single-agent chemotherapy with methotrexate. Methotrexate is administered in a multi-dose regimen (Day 1, 3, 5, 7) alternating with folinic acid (Day 2, 4, 6, 8).</li><li>\u2022 Methotrexate with folinic acid:</li><li>\u2022 < 6: LOW RISK > 7 HIGH RISK</li><li>\u2022 < 6: LOW RISK</li><li>\u2022 > 7 HIGH RISK</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Methotrexate: Methotrexate alone might be considered for very low-risk cases.

Methotrexate:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. EMACO regimen: The EMACO regimen, which includes etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine, is used for high-risk choriocarcinoma. This patient's score indicates a low-risk profile, making EMACO unnecessary and more toxic than needed.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. EMACO regimen:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Hysterectomy: Hysterectomy is not the first line of treatment for choriocarcinoma, especially in the context of low-risk metastatic disease.
