      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Exclusive breastfeeding with total bilirubin more than 10mg/dl after 3-4 weeks of birth Option: C. Exclusive breastfeeding with total bilirubin more than 10mg/dl after 3-4 weeks of birth Approximately 2-4% of exclusively breastfed term babies have jaundice in excess of 10 mg/ dl beyond third-fourth weeks of life. This is a common pattern, and the jaundice usually resolves without any extra intervention, although the bilirubin levels may remain elevated for a certain time period. However, these babies should be investigated for prolonged jaundice to rule out other causes. A diagnosis of breast milk jaundice should be considered if this is unconjugated (not staining nappies); and other causes for prolongation such as inadequate feeding, continuing hemolysis, extravasated blood, G6PD deficiency and hypothyroidism have been ruled out. Mothers should be advised to continue breastfeeding at frequent intervals and TSB levels usually decline over a period of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Breastfeeding should not be continued This is not true. Breastfeeding should not be stopped in cases of breast milk jaundice, as it is generally considered safe and beneficial. This jaundice will typically resolve with continued breastfeeding. Option: B. Most of the children require phototherapy This statement is not true. While some cases of breast milk jaundice may require phototherapy, most cases will fall under physiological jaundice amd hence mostly do not require phototherapy. The jaundice typically resolves on its own over time. Option: D. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia This is not true in the case of breast milk jaundice. Breast milk jaundice is characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, not conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia typically suggests other causes of jaundice, such as liver disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Approach To An Infant With Jaundice:</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>In chest compression, depth must be at least 1/3rd of AP diameter of the child's chest In pediatric CPR, the recommended depth for chest compressions is at least 1/3rd of the anterior-posterior (AP) diameter of the child's chest. For infants, this typically translates to about 1.5 inches (4 cm), and for children, it is about 2 inches (5 cm). This depth ensures effective compression and circulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. This ratio (30:2) is correct for adult CPR. However, for pediatric CPR, especially for single rescuer, the recommended compression-to-ventilation ratio is 30:2 for infants and children (up to puberty) when there is one rescuer. But in the case of two rescuers, the ratio for children is 15:2. Therefore, this statement is not fully accurate in the context of pediatric CPR. Option: B. This is not true. While interosseous (IO) access is a valid route for drug administration in pediatric resuscitation when IV access is not available, the preferred method for adenosine administration is intravenous (IV) if access is available. Option: D. This is incorrect. The correct dose of adrenaline (epinephrine) in pediatric resuscitation is 0.01 mg/kg IV or IO for cardiac arrest, but the concentration should be 1:10,000, not 1:1000.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Factor XIII The most likely deficient factor in this patient is Factor XIII based on the clinical features and the positive urea clot solubility test. Clinical Presentation : The patient has a history of epistaxis , recurrent rectal bleed , and bleeding from the umbilicus since birth. This type of bleeding is suggestive of a bleeding disorder. Normal Coagulation Tests : The laboratory tests showed normal prothrombin time (PT) , normal partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) , normal thrombin time , normal platelet count , and normal platelet function . These findings suggest that the defect is not related to the classic clotting factors (I-XII), which affect PT and aPTT. Urea Clot Solubility Test : The positive urea clot solubility test is a key finding. This test is specifically used to detect Factor XIII deficiency , as Factor XIII is involved in the final step of coagulation, where fibrin clot stabilization occurs. A deficiency in Factor XIII leads to the formation of unstable fibrin clots that can dissolve prematurely, which would explain the bleeding. Factor XIII deficiency (Fibrin-Stabilizing Factor or Transglutaminase Deficiency) presents with bleeding manifestations, particularly in the neonatal period, and is often associated with umbilical cord bleeding, as well as recurrent soft tissue and mucosal bleeds (such as epistaxis and rectal bleeding). Importantly, the deficiency does not affect routine coagulation tests (PT, aPTT) but is revealed by the urea clot solubility test. Factor XIII deficiency is a rare autosomal bleeding disorder. Factor XIII is a hetero tetramer composed of two catalytic A subunits and two carrier B subunits; activation of factor XIII by thrombin frees the activated A subunits, which covalently crosslink fibrin to increase clot strength and constrain fibrinolysis. The different biochemical roles of the A and B subunits result in distinct clinical manifestations. Inherited deficiencies in the factor XIII A-subunit results in soft tissue, umbilical, surgical, joint, and intracranial bleeding; the latter occurs in about a third of cases. Deficiencies in the B-subunit are associated with mild mucocutaneous and surgical bleeding. Because of its role in stabilizing the fibrin clot, factor XIII deficiency often presents with delayed abnormal bleeding or bruising symptoms where patients may have mild trauma and then present with an excessive hematoma on the following day. Extra hematologic clinical manifestation of factor XIII deficiency includes delayed umbilical cord separation, poor wound healing, and recurrent miscarriages. Treatment for bleeding or major surgery is 20-40 U/kg of factor XIII concentrate. Recombinant A-subunit protein is also available for A-subunit deficiencies.</p>\n<p></p>",

Failure to regain appetite by day 4 suggests that the patient is not responding to treatment as expected. Failure to start to lose edema by day 4 (B): Edema (swelling due to fluid retention) is common in severe acute malnutrition. The expectation is that edema should begin to reduce within a few days of treatment. Failure to see this improvement by day 4 suggests inadequate recovery. Complete absence of edema by day 10 (C): While a patient starting to lose edema may indicate progress in some cases, complete absence of edema by day 10 is a sign of primary failure.

Discharge from Nutrition Rehabilitation Centre Child Oedema has resolved Child has achieved weight gain of > 15% (See Annexure 19 for target weight at 15% weight gain) and has satisfactory weight gain for 3 consecutive days (>5 gm/kg/day) Child is eating an adequate amount of nutritious food that the mother can prepare at home All infections and other medical complications have been treated Child is provided with micronutrients Immunization is updated Mother/caregiver Knows how to prepare appropriate foods and to feed the child Knows how to give prescribed medications, vitamins, folic acid and iron at home Knows how to make appropriate toys and play with the child Knows how to give home treatment for diarrhoea, fever and acute respiratory infections and how to recognize the signs for which medical assistance must be sought Follow-up plan is discussed and understood Where community based programme is well functioning, child can be transferred from facility based care to community based care for achieving target weight gain of 15%, based on the following criteria: Child has completed antibiotic treatment Has good appetite (eating at least 120-130 cal/kg/day) Has good weight gain (of at least 5g/kg/day for three consecutive days) on exclusive oral feeding No oedema Caretakers sensitized to home care and education has been completed Immunization is up-to-date If the child has not recovered in four months s/he is classified as a \"Non-Responder. Micronutrient supplementation in SAM child: Vitamin A: Give Vitamin A in a single dose to all SAM children unless there is evidence that child has received vitamin A dose in last 1 month. Recommended oral dose of Vitamin A according to child's age Age Vit. A dose < 6 months 50 000 IU 6-12 months or if weight <8Kg 100 000 IU >12 months 200 000 IU Give same dose on Day 1, 2 and 14 if there is clinical evidence of vitamin A deficiency. Children more than twelve months but having weight less than 8 kg should be given 100,000 IU orally irrespective of age. Oral treatment with vitamin A is preferred, except for initial treatment of. For oral administration, an oil- based formulation is preferred. IM treatment should be used in children with severe anorexia, oedematous malnutrition, or septic shock. Only water-based formulations and half of oral dose should be used. Other micronutrients should be given daily for at least 2 weeks: Multivitamin supplement (should contain vitamin A, C, D, E and B12 and not just vitamin B-complex): Twice Recommended Daily Allowance Folic acid: 5 mg on day 1, then 1 mg/day Elemental Zinc: 2 mg/kg/day Copper: 3 mg/kg/day (if separate preparation not available use commercial preparation containing copper) Iron: Start daily iron supplementation after two days of the child being on Catch up diet. Give elemental iron in the dose of 3 mg/kg/day in two divided doses, preferably between meals. (Do not give iron in stabilization phase.) Admission criteria for SAM child: Criteria for admission for inpatient treatment Children 6-59 months Any of the following: MUAC <115mm with or without any grade of oedema WFH-3 SD with or without any grade of oedema Bilateral pitting oedema +/++ (children with oedema+++ always need inpatient care) WITH Any of the following complications: Anorexia (Loss of appetite) Fever (39 degree C) or Hypothermia (<35 C Persistent vomiting Severe dehydration based on history and clinical examination Not alert, very weak, apathetic, unconscious, convulsions Hypoglycemia Severe Anemia (severe palmar pallor) Severe pneumonia Extensive superficial infection requiring IM medications Any other general sign that a clinician thinks requires admission for further assessment or care In addition to above criteria if the caregiver is unable to take care of the child at home, the child should be admitted. Infants < 6 months Infant is too weak or feeble to suckle effectively (independently of his/her weight-for-length). or WfL (weight-for-length) <-3SD (in infants >45 cm) or Visible severe wasting in infants <45 cm or Presence of oedema both feet Other reasons for inpatient enrolment Readmission: Child previously discharged from in-patient care but meets admission criteria again. Return after default: Child who returns after default (away from in-patient care for 2 consecutive days) and meets the admission criteria.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Influenza virus According to Nelson, parainfluenza virus is the most common viral cause of croup, but other viruses such as influenza, RSV, and adenovirus are also frequently implicated. Influenza virus is often noted as the most common pathogen, especially during flu season. Hemophilus influenza: While this bacterium was once a common cause of respiratory infections in children, it is less common now due to the widespread use of the Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) vaccine. It is more typically associated with conditions like epiglottitis than croup. Streptococcus pneumonia: This bacterium is a common cause of pneumonia and other bacterial infections but is not a typical cause of croup. Croup is primarily viral in origin. Influenza virus: Influenza virus is indeed one of the most common viral causes of croup, particularly in fall and winter. Other viruses that can cause croup include parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus, but influenza virus is the correct choice among the options provided. Diphtheria: While diphtheria can cause severe respiratory symptoms (including a membrane in the throat), it is not a common cause of croup in children.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Increase in Oxygen After birth, the newborn starts breathing air, which leads to an increase in oxygen levels in the blood. High oxygen levels cause the smooth muscle in the ductus arteriosus to constrict, which leads to its closure. This is the main trigger for ductus arteriosus closure. First Stage (Functional closure): Within 10~15 hours after birth (contraction of smooth muscle & approximation of intima cushion) Second Stage (Anatomic closure): Completed by 2-3 weeks (fibrous proliferation of intima, necrosis of media, hemorrhage in the wall and sealing of the lumen) Ductus arteriosus is closed by 8 weeks in 88% Physiology: Vasoactive substances (acetylcholine, bradykinin, endogenous catecholamine and others) by variations in PH, but CHIEFLY BY O 2 tension and prostaglandins (PGE1, PGE2, prostacyclin, PGI2)</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Decrease in CO2 : The normalizing or decrease in CO2 levels after birth (due to the lungs taking over the function of gas exchange) may also play a secondary role in the closure of the ductus arteriosus. However, this effect is less direct than oxygen. Option: C. Increase in pulmonary vascular resistance : After birth, the pulmonary vascular resistance decreases as the lungs fill with air and begin functioning. This reduction in resistance contributes to the closure of the ductus arteriosus by increasing the pressure in the aorta compared to the pulmonary artery, but it is not the primary factor. Option: D. Fall in concentration of catecholamines : While catecholamines (such as adrenaline) have various roles in fetal and postnatal circulation, the fall in catecholamine levels is not directly responsible for the closure of the ductus arteriosus.</p>\n<p></p>",
