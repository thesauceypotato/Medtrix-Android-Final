      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Both a and b The clinical scenario is multipara with twin gestation with anemia developing Atonic uterus leading to postpartum hemorrhage . Although uterine fibroid is a cause of the Atonic uterus, the presence of uterine fibroid is not mentioned in the given clinical history. Hence it is not the answer. Atonic uterus (80 Percent): Atonicity of the uterus is the commonest cause of postpartum hemorrhage. The following are the conditions that often interfere with the retraction of the uterus and the placental site in particular. Grand multipara \u2014Inadequate retraction and frequent adherent placenta contribute to it. Associated anemia may also probably play a role. Over distension of the uterus as in multiple pregnancies, hydramnios, and big babies ( > 4 kg). Imperfect retraction and a large placental site are responsible for excessive bleeding. Malnutrition and anemia ( < 9.0 g/dL) \u2014Even a slight amount of blood loss may develop clinical manifestations of postpartum hemorrhage. Antepartum hemorrhage (Both placenta previa and abruption): Prolonged labor ( > 12 hours): Poor retraction, infection (amnionitis), and dehydration are essential factors (Tone). Anesthesia: Depth of anesthesia and the anesthetic agents (ether, halothane) may cause atonicity. Initiation or augmentation of delivery by oxytocin: Post-delivery uterine atonicity is likely unless the oxytocin is continued for at least one hour following delivery. Malformation of the uterus : Implantation of the placenta in the uterine septum of a septate uterus or the corneal region of a bicornuate uterus may cause excessive bleeding. Uterine fibroid causes imperfect retraction mechanically. The mismanaged third stage of labor : This includes\u2014(a) Too rapid delivery of the baby, preventing the uterine wall from adapting to the diminishing contents, (b) Premature attempt to deliver the placenta before it is separated, (c) Kneading and fiddling the uterus, (d) Pulling the cord. All these produce irregular uterine contractions leading to partial separation of the placenta and hemorrhage, (e) Manual separation of the placenta increases blood loss during cesarean delivery. Placenta : Morbidly adherent (accreta, percreta), wholly or partially separated and retained cause PPH. Precipitate labor : The placenta is separated following the baby's birth in rapid delivery. Bleeding continues before the onset of uterine retraction. Bleeding may be due to genital tract trauma also. Other causes of atonic hemorrhage are Obesity (BMI > 35), \u2022 Previous PPH \u2022 Age ( > 40 yrs), t Drugs: Use of tocolytic drugs (ritodrine), MgSO4, Nifedipine.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The average blood loss following vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery, and cesarean hysterectomy is 500 mL, 1000 mL, and 1500 mL, respectively.
