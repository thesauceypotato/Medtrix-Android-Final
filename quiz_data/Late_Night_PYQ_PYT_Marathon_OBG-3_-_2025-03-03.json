D) Low prolactin levels</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in males is characterized by a deficiency of gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which leads to low testosterone levels and impaired spermatogenesis. This condition often results in oligospermia or azoospermia, contributing to infertility. Additionally, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is frequently associated with hyperprolactinemia rather than low prolactin levels.</li><li>\u2022 Low LH and FSH: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is marked by low levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) due to inadequate secretion from the pituitary gland. Low testosterone: The low levels of LH lead to reduced stimulation of Leydig cells in the testes, resulting in low testosterone levels. Oligospermia: The low levels of FSH result in impaired spermatogenesis, often leading to oligospermia or azoospermia. Low prolactin levels (Incorrect): Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is associated with hyperprolactinemia, not low prolactin levels.

A) Sexual abstinence for 3 months and avoid pregnancy for a year</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) is a type of urinary fistula that commonly arises due to obstetric trauma. Small fistulas can heal spontaneously; however, most established fistulas require surgical repair. The surgical repair is usually performed vaginally after approximately 3 months to allow inflammation to subside. Post-operatively, continuous bladder drainage for 14 days along with antibiotics is recommended to facilitate healing. Following VVF repair, it is recommended that the patient abstain from sexual activity for 3 months to allow the surgical site to heal properly and avoid complications. Additionally, pregnancy should be avoided for a year to ensure the integrity and strength of the repair before subjecting the area to the stresses of pregnancy and childbirth.</li><li>\u2022 Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) is a type of urinary fistula that commonly arises due to obstetric trauma.</li><li>\u2022 Small fistulas can heal spontaneously; however, most established fistulas require surgical repair.</li><li>\u2022 The surgical repair is usually performed vaginally after approximately 3 months to allow inflammation to subside.</li><li>\u2022 Post-operatively, continuous bladder drainage for 14 days along with antibiotics is recommended to facilitate healing.</li><li>\u2022 Following VVF repair, it is recommended that the patient abstain from sexual activity for 3 months to allow the surgical site to heal properly and avoid complications.</li><li>\u2022 Additionally, pregnancy should be avoided for a year to ensure the integrity and strength of the repair before subjecting the area to the stresses of pregnancy and childbirth.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

This migration is due to the expansion of the uterus, which effectively moves the placenta away from the cervix. Therefore, the recommended management is to repeat an ultrasound between 28 to 32 weeks to reassess the position of the placenta. By this time, the majority of placentas that were initially low-lying will have moved to a safer position, allowing for a more accurate determination of whether there will be any complications related to placenta previa.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The next best step for a pregnant woman found to have a low-lying placenta at 12 weeks is to repeat the ultrasound at around 32 weeks to reassess the placenta's position and determine appropriate management.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
