A handy mnemonic is a SCALP (skin, connective tissue, aponeurosis, loose connective tissue, and periosteum).

The periosteum and bone are tightly bound together; thus, it is not likely to find infections between these layers. Option C. The areas between the dense connective tissue and aponeurosis and between the connective tissue and the skin layers do not include connecting veins but mainly superficial veins of the head. Option D.
