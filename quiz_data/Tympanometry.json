      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Ad Type Tympanogram The question says Pure tone audiometry shows an air-bone gap of 55 dB in the right ear with normal cochlear reserve. The air-bone gap in pure tone audiometry measures total conductive deafness. Hence it means there is a conductive deafness of 55 dB in the right ear. Next, the question says - Patient has an intact tympanic membrane, so we must look for a cause of this 55 dB conductive deafness. Average hearing loss seen in different lesions of conductive apparatus 1. Complete obstruction of ear canal 2. Perforation of tympanic membrane 3. Ossicular interruption with intact drum 4. Ossicular interruption with perforation 5. Closure of oval window 30 dB 10-40 dB 54dB 10-25 dB 60 dB As it is clear from the above table- the tympanic membrane is intact, and a hearing loss of 55 dB is seen if the ossicular chain is disrupted. Hence it is a case of ossicular discontinuity. An ad type of tympanogram is seen in this.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A.
