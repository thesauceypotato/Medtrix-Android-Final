If asphyxia continues, respiratory movements cease and the baby enters into primary apnea. In primary apnea, HR will fall and neuromuscular tone is low but the BP remains normal The baby starts to breathe /cry after tactile stimulation if the child is in a state of primary apnea Secondary apnea. If the asphyxia continues, the infant develops deep gasping respiration, HR continues to reduce, the blood pressure continues to fall and the infant becomes flaccid. The breathing becomes weaker until the infant gasps. Now unresponsive to stimulation and needs positive pressure ventilation (PPV) to stimulate breathing. Both primary and secondary apnea can be present at birth.</p>\n<p></p>",

Even after chest compression if the HR does not improve, we have to give adrenaline 0.1ml/kg 1 in 10000 dilutions iv or while getting an Umbilical venous catheter (UVC) we can give 0.3 -0.5 ml/kg through Endotracheal tract (ET) tube. Normal saline bolus if the baby looks pale and has a history of blood loss like Antepartum Haemorrhage APH in the mother. Naloxone is indicated only in special circumstances when the mother is taking opioids and you suspect withdrawal effects in neonates.</p>\n<p></p>",
