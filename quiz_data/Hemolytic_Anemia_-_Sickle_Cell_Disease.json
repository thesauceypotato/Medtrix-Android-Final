The peripheral smear shows elongated and crescent-shaped red blood cells, target cells and a nucleated red blood cell. James B Herrick was the first person who describes sickle cell anemia in 1910. He told them as peculiar elongated, sickle-shaped red blood cells in a case of severe anemia. It is produced due to single point mutation from the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the 6th position of the \u03b2 chain. Sickle cell anemia is when HbS is the only Hb present, such as in Homozygous HbS(HbSS). Sickle cell trait is defined as the inheritance of the HbS from one Parent but a normal HbA gene from the other. Erythrocyte deformation, or sickling, is initially reversible, but after an undetermined number of cell sickling events, the cell becomes irreversibly deformed. These are known as irreversibly sickled cells (ISCs). Sickle erythrocytes lead to the clinical and laboratory phenotypes of disease. Sickle cells interact with endothelial cells and other blood cells, occluding flow in small and sometimes large vessels and causing the many complications thought to be a result of vaso occlusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The normal Hemoglobin(Hb A) in adults contains 2 \u03b1 and 2\u03b2 chains.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Bed rest Acute painful episodes are the most common critical events in sickle cell disease. It is characterised by unprovoked severe pain in the extremities or torso that is often symmetrical and stereotypical and usually requires treatment with potent opioids. Provocative factors include infection, fever, excessive exercise, anxiety, abrupt changes in temperature, hypoxia, or hypertonic dyes. All patients will experience it at some point. It is the most common reason for hospitalization. Vaso-occlusive episode -defined as new onset pain lasting for> 4 hours with no alternative explanation, requiring analgesics. Sudden deaths-due from Arrhythmias or pulmonary embolism Predictors of severe crisis or multi-organ failure- drastic drop in hemoglobin, a drastic drop in platelet counts, and extreme leukocytosis. Pathophysiology- In SCA, the intracellular concentration of HbS is almost 100% . The fundamental event in pathophysiology is the polymerisation of HbS. The damaged RBCs are less flexible and highly adhesive. Repeated cycles of sickling and unsickling- SHORTEN the RBCs lifespan\u2014>Occlusion of blood vessels in every body organ\u2014--> trigger inflammatory cascade\u2014- ->vascular endothelial dysfunction and chronic organ damage. The diagrammatic representation is as follows. HbS is physiologically similar to HbA in most aspects in the Oxygenated form. Once deoxygenated, it polymerises. Post-capillary venules are small and deoxygenated areas with maximum damage. Hence if we prevent the deoxygenation of HbS, we can avoid the pathological manifestations of the disease.</p>\n<p></p>",

The risk of stroke in untreated sickle cell disease patients is around 10-15%. The risk factors for stroke in these patients-Anemia, are leukocytosis and hypertension. In a patient with newly diagnosed sickle cell anemia risk of stroke is decreased by annual screening with TCD(trans cranial doppler) from 2 years of age to 16 years annually and giving them chronic transfusion therapy indefinitely based on the results. Hydroxyurea(inducing high levels of HbF) effectively prevents stroke in patients with abnormal transcranial Doppler. Chronic transfusion therapy is helpful in primary and secondary stroke prevention.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B & D.

Diagnosed by sudden enlarged and tender spleen, drop in hemoglobin by 2gm%, increased Reticulocyte count, Thrombocytopenia, and Hypovolemia. In younger patients, we can diagnose it by acute anemia and hypovolemic shock. In older patients, there is insidiously progressing splenomegaly with anemia.
