      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Glossopharyngeal The glossopharyngeal nerve originates in the medulla oblongata of the brain. It emerges from the anterior aspect of the medulla, moving laterally in the posterior cranial fossa. The nerve leaves the cranium via the jugular foramen. At this point, the tympanic nerve arises. It has a mixed sensory and parasympathetic composition. Immediately outside the jugular foramen lie two ganglia (collections of nerve cell bodies). They are known as the superior and inferior (or petrous) ganglia \u2013 they contain the cell bodies of the sensory fibres in the glossopharyngeal nerve. Extracranial, the glossopharyngeal nerve descends down the neck, anterolateral to the internal carotid artery. At the inferior margin of the stylopharyngeus, several branches arise to provide motor innervation to the muscle. It also gives rise to the carotid sinus nerve, which provides sensation to the carotid sinus and body. The nerve enters the pharynx by passing between the superior and middle pharyngeal constrictors. Within the pharynx, it terminates by dividing into several branches \u2013 lingual, tonsil and pharyngeal. Pharyngeal branch \u2013 combines with fibres of the vagus nerve to form the pharyngeal plexus. It innervates the mucosa of the oropharynx. Lingual branch \u2013 provides the posterior 1/3 of the tongue with general and taste sensation Tonsillar branch \u2013 forms a network of nerves, known as the tonsillar plexus, which innervates the palatine tonsils. Sensory : Innervates the oropharynx, carotid body and sinus, posterior 1/3 of the tongue, middle ear cavity and Eustachian tube. Special sensory : Provides taste sensation to the posterior 1/3 of the tongue. Parasympathetic : Provides parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland. Motor : Innervates the stylopharyngeus muscle of the pharynx.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The glossopharyngeal nerve , also known as the ninth cranial nerve , is a cranial nerve that exits the brainstem from the sides of the upper medulla, just anterior (closer to the nose) to the vagus nerve. Being a mixed nerve (sensorimotor), it carries afferent sensory and efferent motor information. The motor division of the glossopharyngeal nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic medulla oblongata, whereas the sensory division originates from the cranial neural crest.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A- Vagus Option B- Facial Option D- Trigeminal Option A, B and D are incorrect answer because marked area in the image is innervated by glossopharyngeal nerve via, Pharyngeal branch \u2013 combines with fibres of the vagus nerve to form the pharyngeal plexus. It innervates the mucosa of the oropharynx. Lingual branch \u2013 provides the posterior 1/3 of the tongue with general and taste sensation Tonsillar branch \u2013 forms a network of nerves, known as the tonsillar plexus, which innervates the palatine tonsils.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Although the facial nerve splits into its five terminal branches in the parotid gland, it is the glossopharyngeal nerve that actually supplies the gland. The glossopharyngeal nerve supplies sensory innervation to the oropharynx, and thus carries the afferent information for the gag reflex. When a foreign object touches the back of the mouth, this stimulates CNIX, beginning the reflex. The efferent nerve in this process is the vagus nerve, CNX.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Vagus nerve Control of the gag reflex is by both the glossopharyngeal (IX) and vagus (X) nerves, which serve as the afferent and the efferent limbs for the reflex arc, respectively. The nerve roots of cranial nerves IX and X exit the medulla through the jugular foramen and descend on either side of the pharynx to finally innervate the posterior pharynx, posterior one-third of the tongue, soft palate, and the stylopharyngeus muscle. The stimulus is provided by sensation to the posterior pharyngeal wall, the tonsillar pillars, or the base of the tongue. These sensations are carried by CN IX, which acts as the afferent limb of the reflex to the ipsilateral nucleus solitarius (also referred to as the gustatory nucleus) after synapsing at the superior ganglion located in the jugular foramen. In turn, these nuclei send fibers to the nucleus ambiguus, which is a motor nucleus present in the rostral medulla. Efferent nerve fibers to the pharyngeal musculature traverse from the nucleus ambiguus through the CN X. This ultimately results in the bilateral contraction of the posterior pharyngeal muscles. Contraction of the pharyngeal musculature ipsilateral to the side of the stimulus is known as the direct gag reflex, and contraction of the musculature on the contralateral side is known as the consensual gag reflex.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Testing the gag reflex can also help assess damage to CN IX and CN X.  If the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) is damaged on one side, there will be no response when touched. If the vagus (X) nerve is damaged, and either side is touched, the soft palate will elevate and move toward the affected side. If both CN IX and X are damaged on one side, touching the intact side will result in a unilateral response with deviation of the palate to that side. There will be no response when touching the damaged side. Stimulation of the soft palate can also elicit the gag reflex; however, the sensory limb, in this case, is the trigeminal nerve (CN V).
