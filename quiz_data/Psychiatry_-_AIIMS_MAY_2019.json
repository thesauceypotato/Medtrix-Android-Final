      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Visual hallucinations Visual hallucinations are a hallmark sign of Lewy body dementia (LBD). In addition to visual hallucinations, other features of LBD include Parkinsonism (parkinsonian movement symptoms), fluctuating dementia (changes in cognitive abilities), and delirium-like phases.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>LBD is a progressive dementia characterized by the presence of abnormal protein deposits called Lewy bodies in the brain. These deposits disrupt the normal functioning of chemicals in the brain, leading to various cognitive, behavioral, and motor symptoms. Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer's disease dementia.</p>\n<p><strong>:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Cerebral ataxia: Cerebral ataxia, which refers to a lack of coordination and balance due to dysfunction in the cerebrum, is not specifically associated with Lewy body dementia. Option C. Urinary incontinence: While urinary incontinence can occur in individuals with various forms of dementia, it is not a specific sign of Lewy body dementia. Option D. Choreiform movements: Choreiform movements, characterized by involuntary jerky movements, are not typically associated with Lewy body dementia. They are more commonly seen in conditions such as Huntington's disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>LBD shares overlapping features with both Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, and it may coexist with these conditions. Individuals with LBD may also experience REM sleep behavior disorder, which involves acting out dreams during sleep. Diagnosis of LBD is based on clinical evaluation, history, and examination, along with brain imaging and other tests to rule out alternative causes.</p>\n<p></p>",

Mania and schizophrenia are different mental health conditions with distinct symptoms. Melancholia is a historical term sometimes used to describe a severe form of depression.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B: Major depressive disorder is a broader term that encompasses various subtypes, including melancholia. While major depressive disorder can present with intense depression, the specific mention of melancholia in the question indicates a more precise answer. Option C: Mania refers to a distinct mood state characterized by elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, increased energy levels, decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, and impulsivity. It is typically associated with bipolar disorder rather than intense depression without cause. Option D: Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by a range of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking and speech, and impaired social functioning. While depression can be a feature of schizophrenia, the question specifies the absence of any cause, which is more indicative of melancholia.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Melancholia is sometimes referred to as endogenous depression, as it is believed to arise from internal factors rather than external stressors. Major depression is diagnosed when five or more of following symptoms are present for at least 2 weeks: Depressed mood Anhedonia Appetite changes Insomnia or hypersomnia Psychomotor changes Low energy Low concentration Worthlessness Suicidal thoughts</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Suicide occurring at the time when the patient starts to recover Paradoxical suicide is best described as suicide occurring at the time when the patient starts to recover from their depressive episode. It refers to a situation where a patient, who may have had suicidal thoughts but did not act upon them, suddenly takes action on those thoughts after experiencing some improvement, such as through medication or therapy. This phenomenon highlights the importance of closely monitoring patients who are recovering from severe depression for any signs of increased risk for suicide.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Suicide after taking a low dose of a drug: This option does not specifically capture the concept of paradoxical suicide, which relates to the timing of suicide in relation to the patient's recovery from depression.
