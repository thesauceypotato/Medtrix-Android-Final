This condition leads to enlargement of the right atrium and right ventricle as they handle increased blood volume. However, the left atrium is not typically enlarged in uncomplicated cases of ASD because the blood is shunted away from it, reducing its workload rather than increasing it. Enlargement of the left atrium may occur in advanced stages such as with the development of Eisenmenger's syndrome, where a reversal of the shunt occurs, but this is not the initial presentation.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
