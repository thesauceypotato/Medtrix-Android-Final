C)\u00a0Vitamin A</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 Xerophthalmia, including conjunctival xerosis (dryness of the conjunctiva), is a hallmark sign of Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is essential for the maintenance of healthy epithelial tissues, including the conjunctiva and cornea of the eye. It also plays a crucial role in vision, particularly in low-light conditions. Deficiency can lead to dryness of the eye, night blindness, and in severe cases, can progress to keratomalacia and blindness.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Vitamin B1: Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) deficiency primarily affects the nervous system and can lead to conditions like beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. It does not typically manifest as xerophthalmia or conjunctival xerosis, which are eye-related conditions.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Vitamin B1:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Vitamin B3: Vitamin B3 (Niacin) deficiency leads to pellagra, which is characterized by the \"three Ds\": dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia. While dermatitis can affect the skin around the eyes, it does not cause xerophthalmia, which is specifically related to dryness of the conjunctiva and cornea.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Vitamin B3:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Vitamin D: Vitamin D deficiency is primarily associated with bone diseases like rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults due to its role in calcium and phosphate metabolism. It is not typically associated with xerophthalmia or eye disorders.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

D)\u00a0RNA editing</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The difference between Apo B 48 and Apo B 100 is due to RNA editing. In the intestine, a specific cytidine in the mRNA for Apo B is deaminated to uridine, which changes the codon from one encoding amino acid to a stop codon. This results in the production of a shorter protein, Apo B 48. In the liver, this editing does not occur, so the full-length Apo B 100 is produced.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. DNA Gene Mutation in Intestines: Incorrect. The difference between Apo B 48 and Apo B 100 is not due to a DNA gene mutation specific to the intestines. Both proteins are derived from the same gene, and the variation in their production is not the result of a DNA mutation.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. DNA Gene Mutation in Intestines:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Point Mutation in Liver: Incorrect. Similarly, the production of these two forms of apolipoprotein B is not due to a point mutation in the liver. The liver produces Apo B 100, but this is not because of a mutation in the hepatic DNA.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Point Mutation in Liver:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. DNA Gene Splicing: Incorrect. While alternative splicing is a common mechanism in generating protein diversity, it is not the process responsible for the difference between Apo B 48 and Apo B 100.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.
