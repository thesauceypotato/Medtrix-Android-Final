HCMV respiratory tract infection leads to pneumonitis in the immunocompromised host, which is often associated with a bad clinical course. Among solid organ transplant recipients, CMV pneumonia is most common in lung transplantations, ranging from 15-55% of cases.

Option C. Candidiasis is an infection caused by yeast (a type of fungus) called Candida. Candida usually lives on the skin and inside the body, such as in the mouth, throat, gut, and vagina, without causing any problems. Candida can cause an infection if conditions change inside the vagina to encourage its growth. Option D. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a serious infection caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii . Most people who get PCP have a medical condition that weakens their immune system, like HIV/AIDS, or take medicines (such as corticosteroids) that lower the body\u2019s ability to fight germs and sickness. Options B, C and D. Are not the most common agent causing this in transplant patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Occasionally, CMV can cause mononucleosis or hepatitis (liver problem).

This virus is spread through sexual and nonsexual contact with body secretions.

Because of improved survival of transplant patients, the proportion of late and EBV-negative PTLD increases. The pathogenesis needs to be better understood.
