In contrast to tamoxifen, it inhibits ER dimerization so that ER interaction with DNA is prevented and receptor degradation is enhanced.

Lymphocyte proliferation, antibody production, and CMI are inhibited. As an \u2018add on\u2019 drug to cyclosporine + glucocorticoid in renal transplantation, it has been found as good or even superior to azathioprine, but should not be combined with azathioprine. It can help to reduce the dose of cyclosporine and thus its toxicity. MMF + glucocorticoid + sirolimus is a non-nephrotoxic combination that is utilized in patients developing renal toxicity with cyclosporine/tacrolimus. MMF is rapidly absorbed orally and quickly converted to the active metabolite mycophenolic acid. This is then slowly inactivated by glucuronidation with a t\u00bd of ~ 16 hours.
