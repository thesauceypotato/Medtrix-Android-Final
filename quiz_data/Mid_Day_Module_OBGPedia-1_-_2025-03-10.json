Techniques for preventing perineal trauma. For women in the second stage of labor, techniques to reduce perineal trauma and facilitate spontaneous birth (including perineal massage, warm compresses and a \u201chands on\u201d guarding of the perineum) are recommended, based on a woman\u2019s preferences and available options.
