Lesions of the frontal eye field of one hemisphere cause the two eyes to deviate to the side of the lesion and an inability to turn the eyes to the opposite side.

Lesion of Broca\u2019s area on the dominant side of the hemisphere causes expressive aphasia. It is characterized by hesitant and distorted speech with relatively good comprehension. It results in loss of ability to produce speech, i.e. expressive aphasia (also called motor aphasia). The patients, however, retain the ability to think about the words they wish to say, they can write the words, and they can understand their meaning when they see or hear them. Thus, although the language is understood, it cannot be expressed in speech even though there is no paralysis of the muscles of the lips, tongue, and vocal cords.

Receptive Speech Area of Wernicke is also known as sensory language area. Lesions of Wernicke's area in the dominant hemisphere produce a loss of ability to understand spoken and written speech. This condition is called receptive sensory aphasia. Since Broca's area is unaffected, expressive speech is unimpaired and the individual can produce fluent speech. However, he is unaware of the meaning of the words he uses consequently he uses, incorrect words or even non-existent words. Option: C. Premotor area coincides with Brodmann's area 6 and is situated anterior to the motor area in the superolateral and medial surfaces of the hemisphere. Lesion of supplementary motor area 6 leads to apraxia and akinesia. This is the condition that involves difficulty in performing the skilled movements once learned, in the absence of paralysis, ataxia, or sensory loss. When the disability affects writing, it is called agraphia. Option: D. Destructive lesion of primary motor area 4 results in voluntary paresis of the affected part of the Spastic voluntary paralysis of the opposite side of the body characteristically follows, if the lesion spreads beyond area 4 or that interrupts projection fibers in the medullary center or internal capsule. Irritative lesion of the motor area leads to focal convulsive movements of the corresponding part of the body, referred to as Jacksonian epilepsy.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Wernicke's area , also called Wernicke's speech area , is one of the two parts of the cerebral cortex that are linked to speech, the other being Broca's area. It is involved in the comprehension of written and spoken language, in contrast to Broca's area, which is primarily involved in the production of language. It is traditionally thought to reside in Brodmann area 22, which is located in the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere, which is the left hemisphere in about 95% of right-handed individuals and 70% of left-handed individuals. Damage caused to Wernicke's area results in receptive, fluent aphasia. This means that the person with aphasia will be able to fluently connect words, but the phrases will lack meaning. This is unlike non-fluent aphasia, in which the person will use meaningful words, but in a non-fluent, telegraphic manner.</p>\n<p></p>",

In between the nerve cells are the nerve fibers of these cells and capillaries. The pyramidal or corticospinal tract is formed by the axons of pyramidal cells predominantly lying in the motor area of the cerebral cortex.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Layers of the Cerebral Cortex - The neocortex consists of six layers or laminae. From superficial to deep these are as follows: Molecular (plexiform) layer is made up predominantly of nerve fibers and a few scattered horizontal cells of Cajal. External granular layer is made up mainly of densely packed stellate (granule) cells. External pyramidal layer is made up of small and medium-sized pyramidal cells. The sizes of cells increase from superficial to deeper borders of the layer. Internal granular layer is made up of closely packed stellate (granule) cells. In the middle of this layer, there is a band of horizontally arranged white fibers called white stria or external bands of Baillarger. The white stria is most marked in the visual cortex, hence the visual cortex is also called the striate cortex. Internal pyramidal (ganglionic) layer is made up mainly of large pyramidal cells (of Betz). The basal part of this layer contains a thin band of horizontally arranged fibers called the inner band of Baillarger. These cells account for about 3% of the projection fibers of the corticospinal (pyramidal) tract. Multiform layer (or layer of polymorphic cells) is made up of cells of multiple forms (i.e. neurons of various sizes and shapes). This layer fuses with the white matter. Six Layers of the Cerebral Cortex</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. The granular cell layers are afferent in connection and the pyramidal cell layers are efferent in nature. Afferent nerve fibers are the axons carried by a sensory nerve that relays sensory information from sensory receptors to regions of the brain. The efferent fiber is a long process projecting far from the neuron's body that carries nerve impulses away from the central nervous system toward the peripheral effector organs Option: C. Fusiform layer or polymorphous layer contains mainly fusiform cells with a few stellate cells. No pyramidal cells are seen in this layer. Fusiform cells are usually placed in the deepest cortical layer. Their dendrite projects towards the cortical surface, whereas the axon also has the possibility to be commissural, association or projection oriented. Option: D. Pyramidal cells are Golgi type 1 neurons. These neurons have long axons and numerous short dendrites. These are seen in pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, and anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. Golgi Type II are neurons with short axons and establish synapses with neighboring neurons. These Golgi type II neurons have a star-like appearance and are found in cerebral and cerebellar cortices and retina.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Granular cortex: In this type, the granular layers are well developed while the pyramidal layers are poorly developed. Since the density of granule cells is very high, it is termed granular cortex. The granular cortex is the characteristic feature of the sensory areas, viz. primary sensory, acoustic, and visual areas. Agranular cortex : In this type, the granular layers are poorly developed while pyramidal layers are well developed with densely packed pyramidal cells. The agranular cortex is the characteristic feature of the motor areas, viz. primary motor and other areas of the frontal lobe. The cortex is named agranular due to the paucity or absence of granule cells.</p>\n<p></p>",
