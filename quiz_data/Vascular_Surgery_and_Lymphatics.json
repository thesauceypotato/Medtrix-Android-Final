An angiogram may be performed in the operating theatre at the end of the procedure to ensure that flow to the distal leg has been restored.

The classical clinical picture is that of severe pain out of proportion with clinical findings that worsens with time despite appropriate analgesia.

In the groin, it unites with tributaries corresponding to the arterial branches of the common femoral artery, before piercing the cribriform fascia covering the saphenous opening (approximately 2.5 cm below and lateral to the pubic tubercle, but often somewhat higher) and terminates by draining into the common femoral vein (CFV) at the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ).

They are frequently elongated and tortuous, with intermittent \u2018 blowouts \u2019 , but are defined by the presence of reflux. Telangiectasia (thread veins, spider veins and hyphen webs): represent tiny intradermal venules less than 1 mm in diameter . Reticular vein : small dilated \u2018 bluish \u2019 subdermal vein 1\u20132.9 mm in diameter . Saphena varix : is a (usually painless) groin swelling apparent on standing. Corona phlebectatica (malleolar flare): a fan-shaped pattern of telangiectasia on the ankle or foot. This is an early sign of advanced venous disease. Oedema : increased volume of fluid in the skin and soft tissues of the leg. Commonly starts distally and moves more proximally with increasing venous dysfunction. Classically this is \u2018 pitting oedema \u2019 , with firm digital pressure leaving an indentation in the soft tissues. Eczema : an erythematous dermatitis, often appears minor, although it may be associated with significant itching and discomfort. Pigmentation (haemosiderosis): a brownish discoloration of the skin, usually permanent. It is usually seen around the ankle, but is also seen in proximity to varicose veins and incompetent perforators. Lipodermatosclerosis (LDS): chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, resulting in a tight, contracted, \u2018 woody \u2019 leg on examination. Atrophie blanche : localised areas of atrophic, white skin, often surrounded by telangiectasia and pigmentation. Venous ulcer : full-thickness skin loss, usually around the ankle, which fails to heal spontaneously and is propagated by continuing venous hypertension and the changes associated with chronic venous disease.</li><li>\u27a4 Varicose vein : subcutaneous dilated vein 3 mm in diameter or larger.

The direct contact with detergent causes cellular death and initiates an inflammatory response, aiming to result in thrombosis, fibrosis and obliteration (sclerosis). The most widely used method is that of Tessari; this utilizes two syringes connected using a three way tap. A 1:3 or 1:4 ratio mixture of sclerosant and air is drawn into one syringe, and is then oscillated vigorously between the two syringes about 10 or 20 times. The foam produced in this way is stable for about 2 minutes so it should be injected as soon as it has been made. The leg is then elevated to empty the veins of blood, and injection of foam commences first with superficial varicosities and ends with injection of the GSV or SSV. Only 1\u20132 mL of foam should be injected at a time. The efficacy of foam sclerotherapy is significantly worse than for endothermal ablation, leading to high reintervention rates, and the rates of complications such as phlebitis and pigmentation can be high.</li><li>\u27a4 Sclerotherapy is the original non-endothermal, non-tumescent technique.</li><li>\u27a4 Sclerotherapy</li><li>\u27a4 non-endothermal, non-tumescent technique.</li><li>\u27a4 It involves the injection of a sclerosing agent directly into the superficial veins .

Warfarin is started simultaneously and after 5 days, LMWH is stopped and warfarin given. Patients with significant renal impairment should be commenced on intravenous unfractionated heparin. Patients who have a sensitivity towards heparinoids , such as those with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia , should commence on another anticoagulant, such as fondaparinux (an indirect factor Xa inhibitor) or bivalirudin (a direct thrombin inhibitor). This will achieve rapid anticoagulation and reduce the risk of embolisation. Typically, patients will then commence on oral anticoagulation for at least 3 months (or longer depending upon the persistence of risk factors or in recurrent cases). Oral anticoagulation using new or \u2018 novel \u2019 anticoagulants (NOACs), which directly inhibit either factor Xa (rivaroxaban and apixaban) or thrombin (dabigatran), is recommended as they are equally effective as vitamin K antagonists (warfarin) in preventing recurrent symptomatic VTE but are associated with less major bleeding complications. Patients who cannot be safely anticoagulated (usually because of bleeding risks) should be considered for a temporary inferior vena cava filter Endovascular surgery aiming to restore patency, including thrombus removal, lysis and stenting techniques, are increasingly used in patients with acute DVT aiming to reduce the risk of chronic post-thrombotic syndrome.
