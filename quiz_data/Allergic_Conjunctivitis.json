Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a recurrent bilateral disorder in which both IgE- and cell-mediated immune mechanisms play important roles. It primarily affects boys and onset is generally from about the age of 5 years onwards. Symptoms consist of intense itching, which may be associated with lacrimation, photophobia, a foreign body sensation, burning, and thick mucoid discharge. Increased blinking is common.

It is less common and tends to be milder than the seasonal form. Option: B. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (\u2018hay fever eyes\u2019), usually occurs or worsens during the spring and summer It is the more common subtype of allergic conjunctivitis. The most frequent allergens are tree and grass pollen, although the specific allergen varies with geographic location. It is typically seen in younger children after playing outside in spring or summer. Acute itching and watering are common, but the hallmark is chemosis, which is frequently dramatic and worrying to the child and parents. Option: D. Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) is rare bilateral disease that typically develops in adulthood (peak incidence 30\u201350 years) following a long history of atopic dermatitis (eczema). Asthma is also extremely common in these patients . About 5% have suffered from childhood VKC. AKC tends to be chronic and unremitting, with a relatively low expectation of eventual resolution and is associated with significant visual morbidity. Whereas VKC is more frequently seasonal and generally worse in the spring, AKC tends to be perennial and is often worse in the winter. Symptoms are similar to those of VKC but are frequently more severe and unremitting.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS It is the inflammation of the conjunctiva due to allergic or hypersensitivity reactions which may be immediate (humeral) or delayed (cellular).

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Contact allergic blepharoconjunctivitis The given case history and findings point towards the diagnosis of Contact allergic blepharoconjunctivitis. Analogous to contact dermatitis, this refers to the acute or subacute T-cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity reaction seen most commonly by ophthalmologists as a reaction to eye drop constituents and by optometrists as a reaction to contact lens solutions. Mascara is a less common cause. There may be a conjunctival reaction, but signs predominantly involve the eyelid skin: erythema, thickening, induration and sometimes fissuring occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Blepharoconjunctivitis can be caused by a variety of issues and is often multifactoria In the acute form, it is useful to categorize the causes by clinical features. If the onset is acute with ulcerating features , this points to an infective process, with the most common organism being Staphylococcus . However, if the onset is acute with no ulceration, this points to an allergic process . If the onset is chronic, one can categorize the causes via the anatomy involved \u2013 posterior versus angular versus anterior . Meibomian gland dysfunction is often the culprit in blepharoconjunctivitis involving the posterior aspect of the eyelid. If there is the involvement of the canthal angle, this is angular blepharoconjunctivitis and can be caused by an infection such as Moraxella or, in rare cases, deficiency of vitamin B6. If the anterior eyelid is involved, this can point to an infection such as Staphylococcus or a seborrheic process . There is an association between this and acne rosacea.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A: Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) is rare bilateral disease that typically develops in adulthood (peak incidence 30\u201350 years ) following a long history of atopic dermatitis (eczema). Asthma is also extremely common in these patients. Option C: Mechanically induced papillary conjunctivitis, the severe form of which is known as giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), can occur secondary to a variety of mechanical stimuli of the tarsal conjunctiva. It is most frequently encountered with contact lens (CL) wear when it is termed contact lens-associated papillary conjunctivitis (CLPC). The risk is increased by the build-up of proteinaceous deposits and cellular debris on the CL surface. Option D: Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a recurrent bilateral disorder in which both IgE- and cell-mediated immune mechanisms play important roles. It primarily affects boys and onset is generally from about the age of 5 years onwards . Symptoms consist of intense itching, which may be associated with lacrimation, photophobia, a foreign body sensation, burning, and thick mucoid discharge. Increased blinking is common. Other causes of blepharoconjunctivitis include parasitic infections such as Demodex , pubic lice, and drugs such as dupilumab.</p>\n<p></p>",

It generally affects those older than 50 years and is of insidious onset with remissions and exacerbations. There is a loss of hemidesmosomes attachment of the epithelium to the basement membrane. Symptoms: include foreign body sensation, redness, watering, and photophobia. Signs: Vesicles occur on the conjunctiva, but more commonly greyish-white membranous patches are seen . Progressive cicatrization follows, eventually leading to essential shrinkage of the conjunctiva, formation of inferior symblepharon, shallowing of the inferior fornix, severe dry eye, superficial punctate keratopathy, entropion, trichiasis, pannus, keratinization and consequent opacification of the cornea . Similar lesions may be found in the nose, mouth, palate, pharynx, esophagus, anus, vagina, urethra, and, more rarely, on the skin. Investigations : The diagnosis is made by conjunctival biopsy for immunofluorescence staining and dermatological, otorhinolaryngological, and gastrointestinal specialist consultations. Management: Depending on the severity of involvement, treatment with artificial tears, protective moisture-retaining glasses, punctal occlusion,topical and systemic steroids, dapsone, immunosuppressive therapy, surgery by mucous membrane grafts and keratoprosthesis for end-stage corneal disease.

With increased conjunctival movement there is mechanical damage to the tarsal and bulbar conjunctival surfaces, the resultant inflammatory response leading to increasing conjunctival oedema and redundancy, with the creation of a self-perpetuating cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Papillary hypertrophy of the superior tarsal plate, often having a diffuse velvety appearance is a characteristic feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. The condition is believed to be the result of blink-related trauma between the upper lid and the superior bulbar conjunctiva, precipitated in many cases by tear film insufficiency and an excess of lax conjunctival tissue. With increased conjunctival movement there is mechanical damage to the tarsal and bulbar conjunctival surfaces, the resultant inflammatory response leading to increasing conjunctival oedema and redundancy, with the creation of a self-perpetuating cycle. Option: B. Conjunctivochalasis is characterized by one or more folds of redundant conjunctiva prolapsing over the lower eyelid margin. It can exacerbate the symptoms of dry eye and commonly contributes to epiphora, of which it can be an under-recognized cause. It is thought to be predominantly an involutional process involving the loss of conjunctival adhesion to the underlying Tenon capsule and episclera and may be analogous to the conjunctival abnormalities leading to superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis. Option: C. There are similarities to mechanically induced papillary conjunctivitis and a comparable clinical picture has been described with contact lens wear and following upper lid surgery or trauma.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>a and c only Mechanically induced papillary conjunctivitis, the severe form of which is known as giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), can occur secondary to a variety of mechanical stimuli of the tarsal conjunctiva. It is most frequently encountered with contact lens (CL) wear when it is termed contact lens-associated papillary conjunctivitis (CLPC). The risk is increased by the build-up of proteinaceous deposits and cellular debris on the CL surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Giant papillary conjunctivitis This is a specific type of allergic inflammation affecting the superior tarsal conjunctiva. Aetiology : It usually occurs due to soft hydrophilic contact lens use, protruding suture ends,s or ocular prostheses. It can also occur rarely after many years of rigid contact lens use. The underlying mechanism is a hypersensitivity reaction (types I and IV) . Symptoms : The usual symptoms are itching, watering, foreign body sensation and, occasionally, blurring of vision. Signs : Signs include conjunctival congestion, which is predominantly in the upper palpebral region with large polygonal papillae on the superior tarsal conjunctiva. Macropapillae are 0.3\u20131.0 mm in size, and giant papillae are 1\u20132 mm in size.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Management: Treatment consists of discontinuing the use of soft contact lenses, removal of offending sutures, cleaning, and polishing of any ocular prosthesis, and replacing it with one coated with a biocompatible material such as Biocoat. Useful ancillary therapy includes mast cell stabilizers (lodoxamide 6 hourly, cromolyn sodium 6 hourly, or olopatadine 12 hourly), along with artificial tears, antihistamine drops, and decongestants. Topical steroids can be administered for a short while and a subtarsal injection of long-acting steroids may be needed in severe cases, provided that the patient is not a steroid responder. Contact lens wear should be discontinued for several weeks: Contact lens (CL) wear should be discontinued for several weeks and the current lenses replaced. For mild\u2013moderate disease, this may be adequate for resolution, sometimes in conjunction with reduced wearing time. In severe CLPC a longer interval without lens wear may be needed. Antimetabolites are alternatives for mild\u2013moderate disease: Antimetabolites have no role in this disease. Antimetabolites serve as 2nd line of management for blistering diseases like Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP), where first-line treatments have already been exhausted. Keratopathy is rare: Keratopathy is rare because of the relatively subdued secretion of inflammatory cytokines. A skin biopsy may help to establish the diagnosis: Skin Biopsy has no diagnostic role. It is used for diseases like leprosy or Steven-Johnson syndrome.</p>\n<p></p>",

Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis is postulated to occur secondary to an allergic , hypersensitivity reaction at the cornea or conjunctiva, following re-exposure to an infectious antigen that the host has been previously sensitized to. Antigens of Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are most commonly associated; however, Herpes simplex, Chlamydia, Streptococcus viridans, Dolosigranulum pigram and intestinal parasites including Hymenolepis nana have also been reported as causative agents.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Presence of one or more whitish raised nodules on the bulbar conjunctiva near the limbus, with hyperemia usually of the surrounding conjunctiva, in a child living in bad hygienic conditions (most of the times) are the diagnostic features of phlyctenular conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B.

Discomfort in bright light (photophobia). Itchy eyes. The area around the cornea where the white of the eye and the cornea meet (limbus) may become rough and swollen. The inside of the eyelids (most often the upper ones) may become rough and covered with bumps and white mucus. Watering eyes. Option D.

Topical therapy : Eye Drops containing antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, decongestants, preservative-free lubricants, anti-inflammatory agents such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, mild surface-acting steroids and topical cyclosporine are useful to control the allergic reaction and consequent inflammation. Acetylcysteine, as 10% or 20% drops three to four times a day for 1\u20132 weeks, is useful in controlling excess mucus . Medications are prescribed in a step ladder approach using minimum medications to start with and adding more depending on the response. Treatment is titrated to the response and tapered off to a maintenance dose. Local therapy : Subtarsal injections of long-acting steroids such as triamcinolone may be required for severe refractory cases. Cryotherapy to the tarsal conjunctiva is sometimes needed to control giant papillae. Surgical treatment : Surgical excision of giant papillae may be required. Shield ulcers can be treated with debridement of the surface and the application of an amniotic membrane and/or a bandage contact lens to promote healing. Systemic therapy : Oral antiallergic medications can be used for a short while in severe bilateral cases with severe symptoms, especially itching, not easily relieved with topical treatment. Chronic cases with secondary mucin-deficient dry eyes can be benefitted from oral treatment with nutritional supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids. Supportive therapy : Cold compresses and tinted glasses are helpful and provide considerable comfort.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

In addition, infiltration with lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, basophils, and eosinophils may be seen. Option: C. The disease is usually self-limiting over a period of a few years. However, in some individuals, the disease is more severe with recurrences for several years with the development of severe dry eyes and corneal ulcers (shield ulcers) with scarring. Option: D. As symptoms and signs subside, topical steroids can be tapered off and discontinued and mast cell stabilizers continued.
