      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>A false-positive result on urine dipstick test A false-negative result is possible in patients with prolonged cholestasis due to the predominance of delta bilirubin, which is covalently bound to albumin and, therefore, not filtered by the renal glomeruli nor in bile. This albumin-linked fraction of conjugated bilirubin ( delta fraction, delta bilirubin, or biliprotein) represents an essential fraction of total serum bilirubin in patients with cholestasis and hepatobiliary disorders . The Delta bilirubin is formed in serum when hepatic excretion of bilirubin glucuronides is impaired, and the glucuronides accumulate in serum. By its tight binding to albumin, the clearance rate of delta bilirubin from serum approximates the half-life of albumin ( 12\u201314 days ) rather than the short half-life of bilirubin (about 4 h). The prolonged half-life of albumin-bound conjugated bilirubin accounts for two previously unexplained enigmas in jaundiced patients with liver disease: (1) that some patients with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia do not exhibit bilirubinuria during the recovery phase of their disease because the delta bilirubin, although conjugated, is covalently bound to albumin and therefore not filtered by the renal glomeruli and (2) The elevated serum bilirubin level declines more slowly than expected in some patients who otherwise appear to recover satisfactorily.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A, C: As conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is always associated with bilirubinuria (except in the presence of delta bilirubin in prolonged cholestasis when jaundice is overt) Option: D: Covalently bound to albumin and therefore not filtered by the renal glomeruli.</p>\n<p></p>",
