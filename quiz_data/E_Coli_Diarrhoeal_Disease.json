In contrast to most E coli strains, O157:H7 E coli does not ferment sorbitol during overnight incubation. As a result, sorbitol-containing MacConkey agar is used for isolation. Also, unlike other E coli strains, E coli O157:H7 does not produce glucuronidase . EHEC elaborates a Shiga-like toxin virtually identical to the Shiga toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae . This toxin is phage-encoded, and its production is enhanced by iron deficiency. The Shiga and the Shiga-like toxins inactivate the 60s ribosomal subunit in human cells, leading to an inhibition of protein synthesis and eventual cell death. Infection with EHEC can also lead to hemolytic-uremic syndrome, characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and renal insufficiency (sometimes with uremia). Unlike Entero invasive E coli, EHEC does not invade the intestinal mucosa. Unlike enterotoxigenic E coli (ETEC), EHEC does not produce a heat-labile toxin (LT) or heat-stable toxin (ST).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. Toxins produced by Bordetella pertussis (adenylate cyclase toxin), ETEC (LT), Campylobacter jejuni (C jejuni enterotoxin), and Vibrio cholerae (choleragen toxin) result in increased intracellular cyclic AMP in intestinal mucosal cells, which leads to decreased absorption and increased secretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Option B. ETEC (ST) and Yersinia enterocolitica (Y enterocolitica enterotoxin) produce toxins that increase intracellular cyclic GMP , leading to watery diarrhea and electrolyte loss. Option C.

Stx-1 (VT1) can inhibit protein synthesis in human cells and is closely related to the Shiga toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae . It is an AB toxin (active A subunit and 5 binding B subunits). The plasmid coding for it is transmitted by a temperate bacteriophage. The B subunits, which form pentamers with a central pore, recognize specific recept ors on target cells and induce receptor-mediated endocytosis and toxin internalization. Subsequently, the enzymatically active A subunit is released and catalyzes the removal of a specific adenine residue, thereby preventing tRNA binding to the 60S ribosomal subunit and inhibiting protein synthesis.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Campylobacter Campylobacter jejuni is a motile, curved, gram-negative rod that is a leading cause of gastroenteritis. The pathogen resides in the gastrointestinal tract of warm-blooded animals and is primarily transmitted to humans due to ingestion of contaminated food, particularly undercooked poultry. However, direct contact with domesticated animals (eg, dogs) is another important source of transmission; puppies from kennels are especially likely to harbor the bacteria. Following ingestion, Campylobacter colonizes the intestinal mucosa , enters enterocytes within endocytic vacuoles, and causes cytotoxic injury due to specific virulence factors (eg, cytolethal distending toxin, lipooligosaccharide}. Patients typically develop fever, crampy abdominal pain, and watery diarrhea that may be bloody. Stool studies will show inflammation (leukocytes, erythrocytes) but no ova or parasites; stool culture is diagnostic (enriched media at 42\u1d52 C [107.6 F] and microaerophilic conditions). Manifestations usually resolve spontaneously in 3-5 days. In a minority of cases, the host response to Campylobacter infection generates cross-reacting antibodies to peripheral nerve myelin gangliosides, leading to Guillain-Barre syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus cause enterotoxin -mediated food-borne illness. Ingestion of the preformed toxin leads to rapid-onset nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (diarrhea can occur but is usually mild}. S aureus food-borne illness is often linked to precooked foods, dairy products, custards, and mayonnaise-based salads; B cereus food-borne illness is often associated with starch-based foods, such as reheated rice. Option: C. Giardia lamblia is usually transmitted by drinking contaminated water. Foodborne or person-to-person spread may also occur. Giardia typically causes foul-smelling, watery diarrhea that is noninflammatory; therefore, no fecal blood or leukocytes are typically present. In addition, stool ova and parasite testing often reveal Giardia trophozoites or cysts. Option: D. Norovirus is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis and is usually transmitted due to food or water contaminated with human feces. Patients typically develop a vomiting-predominant illness with abdominal pain and a moderate amount of watery diarrhea.

In cultures on blood agar at 37\u00b0C, colonies may be very small at 24 hours.

The organism has little biochemical activity, and this is somewhat variable. Option: D. Shigellae are slender gram-negative rods; coccobacillus forms occur in young cultures. Shigellae are facultative anaerobes but grow best aerobically. Convex, circular, transparent colonies with intact edges reach a diameter of about 2 mm in 24 hours. All shigellae ferment glucose.
