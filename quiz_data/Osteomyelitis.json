At this age, the head of the femur is cartilaginous and is rapidly and completely destroyed by the pyogenic process. Onset is acute with rapid abscess formation, which may burst out or be incised and heals rapidly. Usually it is mistaken as a superficial infection and the child presents some time later with complaint of a limp without any pain. On examination, it is found that the child walks with an unstable gait. The affected leg is shorter and hip movements are increased in all directions. Telescopy test is positive. On X-ray, one finds complete absence of the head and neck of the femur. \u25cf  Clinically, this condition closely resembles a congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH) which also sometimes presents at that age. Complete absence of the head and neck, and a normally developed round acetabulum differentiate this condition from CDH.
