Sporothrix schenckii can infect humans and is the causative agent of Sporotrichosis, commonly known as \"rose handler's disease.\" The most common route of infection is the introduction of spores to the body through a cut or puncture wound in the skin. Infection commonly occurs in otherwise healthy individuals but is rarely life-threatening and can be treated with antifungals. FIG: Nodules along the line of lymphatic drainage.</p>\n<p></p>",

Due to the difficulty in cultivating M. leprae in artificial media, vaccine strategies have centered on the use of cross-sensitizing mycobacteria. Bacillus Calmette\u2013Guerin (BCG) has been the most popular among these, but with a widely varying protective efficacy reported from different parts of the world. In three meta-analyses, BCG has shown strong evidence of efficacy against leprosy. Recently, India has focused interest on another vaccine, Mycobacterium indicus pranii vaccine earlier known as Mycobacterium w. To overcome the limitations of these whole cell vaccines, various recombinant BCGs and subunit vaccines have been developed and studied in experimental models. These often yield inconsistent results. However, a new subunit recombinant vaccine \u2013 LepVax holds promise and has completed Phase 1a clinical trials successfully.</p>\n<p></p>",
