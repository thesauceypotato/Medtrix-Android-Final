Holoprosencephalopathy (HPS) results from incomplete separation of the cerebral hemispheres. It is associated with facial abnormalities. Genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in this severe and relatively common ( fetuses and live births) developmental defect. Maternal diabetes and teratogens, such as high doses of alcohol, can destroy embryonic cells in the median plane of the embryonic disc during the third week, producing a wide range of birth defects resulting from the defective formation of the forebrain. In alobar holoprosencephaly, the forebrain is small and the lateral ventricles often merge to form one large ventricle.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Holoprosencephaly ( HPE ) is a cephalic disorder in which the prosencephalon (the forebrain of the embryo) fails to develop into two hemispheres, typically occurring between the 18th and 28th day of gestation. Normally, the forebrain is formed and the face begins to develop in the fifth and sixth weeks of human pregnancy. Holoprosencephaly is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in every 250 conceptions and most cases are not compatible with life and result in fetal death in utero due to deformities to the skull and brain.

Option: C. Rhombencephalon No such defects have been mentioned in the medical literature. Option: D. Diencephalon Failure to form diencephalon results in the absence of a third ventricle. The absence of the third ventricle is often associated with holoprosencephalopathy.

Alobar- Most severe form includes the formation of synophthalmia (a single central eye), proboscis, and severe impairment. Semilobar - Can present with a severely decreased distance between the eyes, a flat nasal bridge, eye defects, cleft lip and palate, and severe impairment. Lobar - Can present with decreased distance between eyes, a flat nasal bridge, and closely spaced nostrils, mental and locomotion delays may be present. Syntelencephaly or middle interhemispheric variant of holoprosencephaly (MIHV)- Mild phenotypic presentation which can present with flat nasal bridge, metopic prominence, shallow philtrum, and possibly mental and locomotion delays. \" Microform\"- Mild phenotypic presentation with reduced distance between eyes, sharp nasal bridge, single maxillary central incisor.</p>\n<p></p>",

Meningeal layer \u2013 deep to the periosteal layer inside the cranial cavity. It is the only layer present in the vertebral column. Between these two layers, the dural venous sinuses are located. They are responsible for the venous vasculature of the cranium, draining into the internal jugular veins. In some areas within the skull, the meningeal layer of the dura mater folds inwards as dural reflections. They partition the brain and divide the cranial cavity into several compartments. For example, the tentorium Cerebelli divides the cranial cavity into supratentorial and infratentorial compartments. The dura mater receives its own blood supply \u2013 primarily from the middle meningeal artery and vein. It is innervated by the trigeminal nerve (v1, v2 and v3).

However, when there is focal brain swelling or a focal space-occupying lesion within the brain or cranial cavity, mass effect and raised intracranial pressure may cause the brain to herniate under the falx Cerebri or, more significantly, through the tentorial incisura. A transtentorial herniation is a type of cerebral herniation broadly divided into two major types based on the direction of herniation: downwards due to supratentorial mass effect and upward due to infratentorial mass effect. Downward transtentorial herniation Downward herniation occurs when there is a mass effect upon or from within the cerebral hemispheres. The pattern of herniation can be divided into lateral and central herniation. Lateral herniation Lateral herniation occurs due to unilateral or asymmetric mass effects. The medial parts of the temporal lobe are pushed into the ambient cistern and up against the brainstem. This can be further divided according to whether the herniation is predominantly anterior (uncal herniation), which is most common, or posterior (posterior parahippocampal gyrus and anterior part of the lingual gyrus ). Central herniation Central herniation occurs when there is a symmetric or severe mass effect resulting in the downward displacement of the thalami and midbrain. Upward transtentorial herniation Ascending transtentorial herniation occurs due to mass effect within the posterior fossa.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Damage to the brainstem results in characteristic deficits that form part of the so-called herniation syndromes.

The supratentorial space is partially partitioned into left and right halves by the falx Cerebri. The supra and infratentorial spaces communicate through a narrow opening in the tentorium, the tentorial notch or incisura.

Extrusion of the cerebellar tonsils downwards into the foramen magnum may result in damage to medullary cardiac and respiratory centres, with resultant changes in heart and respiratory rates. Both of these syndromes may constitute a medical emergency, the former due to rapidly developing hydrocephalus, the latter due to compromise of cardiac and respiratory centres.</p>\n<p></p>",

Bridging veins drain from the underlying brain to the dura mater and the superior sagittal sinus. They have a relatively straight course and do not allow for much movement of the underlying brain tissue. Thus, they are easily placed under high tension. This is particularly important in the elderly where the underlying atrophic brain places these vessels under higher-than-normal tension. Bleeding from bridging veins may strip the dura from the arachnoid mater. This collection of blood is known as a subdural haematoma. Separation of the arachnoid and dura mater requires little physical force, which means that damage to small bridging veins in the space can result in subdural haematoma after even relatively mild head trauma.
