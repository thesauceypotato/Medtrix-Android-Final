The LNG-IUS releases hormones that can thin the endometrial lining, reducing the symptoms of adenomyosis, such as heavy menstrual bleeding and pain. Option B. Contraception : One of the primary uses of LNG-IUS is contraception. It works by releasing levonorgestrel, a progestin, which thickens the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching an egg, thins the lining of the uterus, and partially suppresses ovulation. Option C. Endometrial Hyperplasia : LNG-IUS is used in the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia, a condition where the lining of the uterus becomes too thick. It is especially beneficial in cases without atypia, as it can reduce the proliferation of the endometrial cells, thereby reducing the risk of developing endometrial cancer. Asymptomatic Fibroid Uterus (Correct Answer): While LNG-IUS can help in managing symptoms of uterine fibroids such as heavy menstrual bleeding, its role in the management of an asymptomatic fibroid uterus is limited.</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Adenomyosis : Adenomyosis is a condition where the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium) breaks through the muscle wall of the uterus.

DMPA is highly effective and convenient for those who prefer not to take a daily pill. Option B: Vaginal Contraceptive Ring : The vaginal ring is a small, flexible ring that a woman inserts into her vagina. It releases estrogen and progestin, similar to combination oral contraceptives, but requires less frequent attention as it is typically changed monthly. It is a convenient and effective form of contraception. Option C: Progestin Implants : These are small rods implanted under the skin of the arm that release a steady dose of progestin. They can provide long-term contraception for up to three to five years. The implant is a highly effective, low-maintenance option. Option D: Ulipristal Acetate (Correct Answer): Ulipristal acetate is used as an emergency contraceptive, not a regular method of contraception.

It works by releasing levonorgestrel, a type of progestin, into the uterus, which thickens cervical mucus and thins the endometrial lining. Option B: Combined Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs) : These pills contain both estrogen and progestin. When taken correctly, they have a low failure rate, typically around 0.3% with perfect use. However, the failure rate can be higher (around 7-9%) with typical use, due to missed pills or incorrect timing of intake. Option C: Progesterone-Only Pills (Minipill) : The minipill has a slightly higher failure rate than combined OCPs, typically around 0.3% with perfect use but up to 9% with typical use. This increased failure rate with typical use is partly due to the need for strict adherence to taking the pill at the same time every day. Option D: Implanon (Nexplanon) : This is a subdermal contraceptive implant that releases etonogestrel, a type of progestin. Implanon/Nexplanon is one of the most effective forms of contraception available, with a failure rate of less than 0.05%.

Norelgestromin is a metabolite of norgestimate and is effective in preventing ovulation and altering the cervical mucus and endometrial lining.</li><li>\u2022 Option</li><li>\u2022 D</li><li>\u2022 Norelgestromin</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 The transdermal contraceptive patch uses norelgestromin as its progestin component, along with ethinyl estradiol.

Levonorgestrel : This is a common and effective ingredient in many emergency contraceptive pills. It's a progestin-only pill taken as a single dose (1.5 mg) or in two doses (0.75 mg each, 12 hours apart) within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. It's well-tolerated and has fewer side effects than the Yuzpe regimen.</li><li>\u2022 Option B</li><li>\u2022 Levonorgestrel</li><li>\u2022 Option C . Ulipristal Acetate : This is another effective option for emergency contraception. It's a single-dose pill (30 mg) that can be taken up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected intercourse. It's more effective than levonorgestrel and can be used for a longer window after intercourse.</li><li>\u2022 Option C</li><li>\u2022 Ulipristal Acetate</li><li>\u2022 Option D . Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA) (Correct Answer): DMPA is a long-acting progestin contraceptive administered via injection and is not suitable for emergency contraception.
