It typically occurs after delivery or abortion and is often seen in women with risk factors like cesarean section, prolonged labor, or pelvic infection.</li><li>\u2022 The fever in SPT is caused by a septic thrombus in the pelvic veins\u2014most commonly the ovarian vein\u2014that harbors bacteria and incites a sustained inflammatory response. Since antibiotics alone cannot fully penetrate the infected thrombus, the addition of anticoagulation (usually low molecular weight heparin) is essential. Heparin helps in lysing the thrombus, preventing further propagation and improving antibiotic penetration.</li><li>\u2022 Clinical improvement is usually seen within 48\u201372 hours of initiating combined therapy with antibiotics and heparin.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Stop antibiotics and start heparin :  Incorrect because infection is still present\u2014antibiotics are needed to control the infective component.  Stopping antibiotics would worsen sepsis.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Stop antibiotics and start heparin</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Surgical embolectomy: Too invasive and not first-line.  Reserved for rare cases with septic emboli or failure to respond to medical management.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Surgical embolectomy:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Hysterectomy: Not indicated unless there\u2019s uncontrolled pelvic infection not responding to medical therapy or associated endomyometritis with uterine necrosis.

Bisphosphonates: Bisphosphonates such as Alendronate, Risedronate, Ibandronate, and Zoledronic acid are commonly used to treat osteoporosis. These drugs help to slow down bone resorption, thus preserving bone density. The recommended duration of bisphosphonate therapy is generally 3-5 years, not limited to just 1 year. Studies have shown that longer-term use of bisphosphonates can continue to provide benefits in reducing the risk of fractures. However, the exact duration should be individualized based on the patient's risk factors and response to treatment. Teriparatide: Teriparatide is a recombinant form of parathyroid hormone that stimulates new bone formation. It is particularly beneficial in patients with severe osteoporosis or those who have not responded well to bisphosphonates. When considering treatment with both teriparatide and bisphosphonates, it is often recommended to start with teriparatide first to build bone and then follow with bisphosphonates to maintain the bone density gains achieved with teriparatide.</li><li>\u2022 Elemental Calcium and Vitamin D: Postmenopausal women are recommended to take 1200 mg/day of elemental calcium along with 400-800 IU of vitamin D to help maintain bone health and reduce the risk of fractures.</li><li>\u2022 Elemental Calcium and Vitamin D:</li><li>\u2022 Postmenopausal women are recommended to take 1200 mg/day of elemental calcium along with 400-800 IU of vitamin D to help maintain bone health and reduce the risk of fractures.</li><li>\u2022 Postmenopausal women are recommended to take 1200 mg/day of elemental calcium along with 400-800 IU of vitamin D to help maintain bone health and reduce the risk of fractures.</li><li>\u2022 Bisphosphonates: Bisphosphonates such as Alendronate, Risedronate, Ibandronate, and Zoledronic acid are commonly used to treat osteoporosis.
