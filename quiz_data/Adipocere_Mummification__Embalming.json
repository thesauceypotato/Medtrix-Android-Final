The skin may be shrunken and contracted, dry, brittle, leathery and rusty-brown to black, stretched tightly across anatomical prominences, such as the cheekbones, chin, coastal margins and hips, adheres closely to the bones, and often covered with fungal growths. As the skin contracts, some of the fat cells in the subcutaneous tissues are broken, and the liquid oil is forced into the dermis which becomes translucent. The entire body loses weight up to 60 to 70% and becomes thin, stiff and brittle. In mummified bodies, arms are often abducted in the shoulder joints, and flexed in elbow joints and hands are clenched into fists in most cases. This flexion is often seen in lower limbs also. This is due to the shrinkage of muscles and tendons. Mummification may be partial in some cases, with only limbs or head or trunk being affected. Mummified tissues are dry, leathery and brown. The internal organs become shrunken; hard, dark brown and black and become a single mass. Later, due to putrefaction and maggot activity, they may disappear. If a mummified body is not protected, it will break into fragments gradually, becomes powdery and disintegrates, but if protected, it may be preserved for years. Mummified bodies may be attacked by insects especially moths and larvae of various flies which destroy the body. A mummified body is practically odourless.</p>\n<p></p>",

Time Required for Adipocere Formation: The rate of adipocere formation is extremely variable. In temperate countries, the shortest time for its formation is about three weeks in summer, when it occurs to a certain extent. Stiffening, hardening and swelling of the fat occur over a period of months. In most cases, the change is partial and irregular, but rarely the whole body may be affected. Complete conversion in an adult limb requires at least three to six months. In India, it has been observed to begin within 4 to 5 days. Adipocere may persist for years or decades. Medicolegal Importance: When the process involves the face, the features are well preserved, which helps to establish the identity. The cause of death can be determined because injuries are recognised. The time since death can be estimated.</p>\n<p></p>",

The exchange of heat between the core and the surface of the body occurs only by conduction.</p>\n<p></p>",
