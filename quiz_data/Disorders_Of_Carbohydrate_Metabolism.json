      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Krabbe disease Also called globoid cell leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease is an autosomal recessive fatal disorder of infancy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>It results from the deficient activity of galactocerebrosidase and the white matter accumulation of galactosylceramide, which is normally found almost exclusively in the myelin sheath. Both peripheral and central myelin is affected, resulting in spasticity and cognitive impairment coupled with deceptively normal or even absent deep tendon reflexes. The galactocerebrosidase gene is on chromosome 14 (14q31), and specific disease-causing mutations are known. The infantile form of Krabbe disease is rapidly progressive, and patients present in early infancy with irritability, seizures, and hypertonia. Optic atrophy is evident in the 1st yr of life, and mental development is severely impaired. As the disease progresses, optic atrophy and severe developmental delay become apparent; affected children exhibit opisthotonos and die before 3 yr of age. A late-infantile form of Krabbe presents after age 2 yr. Affected individuals have a course similar to that of the early-infantile form. The diagnosis of Krabbe disease relies on the demonstration of the specific enzymatic deficiency in white blood cells or cultured skin fibroblasts. Causative gene mutations have been identified. Carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis are available. The development of methods to measure galactocerebrosidase activity on dried blood spots has led to the inclusion of Krabbe disease in the newborn screening programs of some states. Treatment of infants with Krabbe disease with umbilical cord blood transplantation has been reported in prenatally identified asymptomatic newborns and symptomatic infants. Transplanted infants appear to develop neurologic manifestations at a slower rate but succumb to a neurologic demise.</p>\n<p></p>",
