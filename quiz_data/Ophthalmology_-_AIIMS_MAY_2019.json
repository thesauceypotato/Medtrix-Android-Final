Toric Lenses:- These are designed to correct distance vision and extra built-in correction for astigmatism. Multifocal 10Ls:- This allows you to see both near and far objects . Some multifocal lenses can also correct intermediate vision. Trifocal IOLs:- This lens has only one corrective zone that is stretched to allow distance and intermediate vision. It uses light-splitting rings to elongate the depth of focus within the eye, giving a wider range of vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

The image suggests Marcus Gunn pupil/ relative afferent pupillary defect which is seen in optic neuritis. Marcus Gunn pupil refers to the paradoxical response of the pupil to light in the presence of a Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) It is confirmed by the swinging-flashlight test. The flashlight is swung to and fro and the pupillary response observed. Normally, both pupils should have remained constricted in the absence of any defect. In the presence of RAPD , when the flashlight is moved from the normal to the abnormal eye, both pupils dilate. Marcus Gunn pupil is a rare condition that affects the eyes, causing each to respond differently when a light is shone into This response indicates that there is dysfunction or disease in the optic nerve or retina .
