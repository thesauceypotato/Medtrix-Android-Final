In some patients with very severe, overt Cushing\u2019s (e.g., difficult-to-control hypokalemic hypertension or acute psychosis), it may be necessary to introduce medical therapy to rapidly control the cortisol excess during the period leading up to surgery. Similarly, patients with metastasized, glucocorticoid-producing carcinomas may require long-term anti-glucocorticoid drug treatment. In the case of ectopic ACTH syndrome, in which the tumour cannot be located, one must carefully weigh whether drug treatment or bilateral adrenalectomy is the most appropriate choice, with the latter facilitating immediate cure but requiring life-long corticosteroid replacement. In this instance, it is paramount to ensure regular imaging follow-up for the identification of the ectopic ACTH  source. Oral agents with established efficacy in Cushing\u2019s syndrome are metyrapone and ketokonazole</p>\n<p></p>",
