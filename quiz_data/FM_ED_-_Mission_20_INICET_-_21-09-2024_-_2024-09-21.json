The scene was secured and examined by a forensic expert from the local medical college, who noted several findings consistent with hanging. The body showed signs of lividity in the lower extremities, and there was noticeable constriction around the neck caused by the ligature. During the examination, the forensic expert observed a distinctive pattern of salivary staining. Based on the positioning of the knot and the principles of forensic medicine, where would the dribbling of saliva most likely be found in this case of atypical hanging?",

As the investigation unfolds, the forensic expert explains the critical nuances of freshwater drowning to the investigative team, focusing on the physiological effects that could lead to fatal outcomes.
