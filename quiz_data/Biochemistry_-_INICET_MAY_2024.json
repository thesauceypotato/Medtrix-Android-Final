A deletion mutation is a type of genetic mutation that involves the removal of a portion of the genetic material. A deletion mutation in the DNA occurs when one or more nucleotides are removed from the DNA sequence Option: B. A frameshift mutation in a gene refers to the insertion or deletion of nucleotide bases in numbers that are not multiples of three. This is important because a cell reads a gene's code in groups of three bases when making a protein. Option: C. Gene addition targets a faulty gene within a patient's cells by adding a functional copy of that gene to affect protein expression or by inserting a different gene that circumvents the defect and restores cell function</p>\n<p></p>",
