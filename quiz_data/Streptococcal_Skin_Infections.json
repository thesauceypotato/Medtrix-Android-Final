His temperature is 39.5 C (103 F) and his blood pressure is 85/45 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient's left leg is swollen and firm with erythema of the overlying skin. There is a small wound draining blood-tinged exudate on his left calf. The patient is taken to the operating room immediately and a large area of necrotic tissue is excised. Gram stain of the necrotic tissue shows Gram-positive cocci and culture of the bacteria performed on a blood agar plate grows small colonies with a wide zone of surrounding hemolysis. Coagulase and catalase tests are negative and the pyrrolidone arylamidase (PYR) test is positive. Which of the following pathogens is most likely responsible for this patient's condition?",

The microbiologic differential for this condition includes Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Aeromonas hydrophila.

S pyogenes can be transmitted through wounds and spread rapidly to the deep layers of the skin and fascia due to the production of hyaluronidase and other hydrolytic enzymes. M protein is another major virulence factor that allows the bacteria to evade phagocytosis by preventing activation of the alternate complement pathway. The bacterium also secretes a multitude of extracellular toxins, including hemolysins O and S (cytotoxins that cause hemolysis) and pyrogenic exotoxins (superantigen s that result in tissue injury and septic shock). Typically, there is a sudden onset of severe pain and swelling at a site of trauma or recent surgery. Patients quickly become hypotensive and develop septic shock. Necrotizing fasciitis is initially treated with aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue along with empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics due to the high incidence of polymicrobial infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. S agalactiae (group B strep) is a coagulase- and catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci that grow in chains. Colonies produce a narrow zone of beta-hemolysis that enhances when plated perpendicular to the S aureus (positive CAMP test). S agalactiae can cause skin and soft tissue infections as well as newborn sepsis and meningitis. Option C. S aureus is a Gram-positive coccus that grows in clusters. It is catalase-positive, coagulase-positive, and PYR-positive. S aureus produces large golden-colored colonies and demonstrates beta-hemolysis. Like S pyogenes, S aureus can also cause monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis. Option D. C perfringens is a large, spore-forming, Gram-positive rod that is a strict It is implicated in food poisoning, clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene), and bacteremia.
