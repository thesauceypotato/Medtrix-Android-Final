      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>CPAP In the resuscitation protocol in neonates, if neonate has apnea or gasping; and/or HR<100/minute, positive pressure ventilation, SpO2 monitor, and consideration of ECG monitor is recommended. Use of 3-lead ECG is recommended for measurement of neonatal heart rate; although it may not be practical in our settings. CPAP is not to be used when active resuscitation is being done with HR < 100. Neonatal resuscitation also known as newborn resuscitation is an emergency procedure focused on supporting the approximately 10% of newborn children who do not readily begin breathing, putting them at risk of irreversible organ injury and death.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION B. Consider ECG monitor: An electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor is used to assess the heart's electrical activity and rhythm, which can provide important information for further management. OPTION C. Positive pressure ventilation: If the HR is less than 100 bpm and the patient is not breathing adequately or has inadequate oxygenation, positive pressure ventilation may be initiated. This involves providing breaths to the patient using a bag-valve mask or other ventilatory device. OPTION D. Supplement with O2: If the patient has inadequate oxygenation, supplemental oxygen should be administered to ensure proper oxygen delivery to the tissues.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>CPAP is a form of non-invasive ventilation that delivers a constant level of positive pressure to the airways. It is typically used in conditions like sleep apnea or respiratory distress.</p>\n<p></p>",

In CPR: CPR involves life-saving interventions performed during emergencies. Manual chest compressions are a key component of CPR. Other interventions may include rescue breaths, defibrillation, and medications. option C . Used in neonatal resuscitation: Neonatal resuscitation provides immediate care to newborns in distress. Interventions include clearing the airway, ventilation, medication, and oxygen support. Specialized equipment is used, such as warming devices and respiratory support tools. option D. To check for apnea: Apnea is a temporary cessation of breathing. Apnea monitors detect and alert healthcare providers about apnea episodes. They monitor respiratory rate, heart rate, and sometimes oxygen saturation levels</p>\n<p></p>",
