This includes the palmar and distal dorsal aspects of the lateral three-and-a-half digits (thumb, index, middle, and half of the ring finger) and central palm The sensation of the palm is provided by the median nerve and a small sensory branch known as the palmar cutaneous, which branches before the carpal tunnel. Option: D. Ulnar nerve The ulnar nerve provides a sensory function to the skin of both the palmar and dorsal aspects of the medial one-and-a-half digits and adjacent palm. In other words, the little finger and medial side of the ring finger. It also provides sensation to the medial side of the dorsum of the hand. Cutaneous Innervation of Hand</p>\n<p></p>",

ECRL is still able to perform wrist extension. Extension of IP joints is done by lumbricals, which are supplied by the Ulnar and median nerve, so they are also normal in the above case.
