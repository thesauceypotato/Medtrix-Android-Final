Shoulder dystocia occurs when either the anterior or the posterior (rare) fetal shoulder impacts on the maternal symphysis or the sacral promontory respectively. Overall incidence varies between 0.2% and 1%. Risk factors: (1) Previous shoulder dystocia (2) Macrosomia (>4.5 kg) (3) Diabetes (4) Obesity (BMI >30 kg/m 2 ) (5) Induced labour (6) Prolonged first stage or second stage of labour (7) Secondary arrest of labour (8) Postmaturity (9) Multiparity (10) Anencephaly (11) Mid-pelvic instrumental delivery (more following ventouse than forceps) (12) Fetal ascites Management: The following maneuvers are commonly employed: Head and neck should be grasped and taken posteriorly while suprapubic pressure is applied by an assistant slightly toward the side of the fetal chest. This will reduce the bis acromial diameter and rotate the anterior shoulder toward the oblique diameter. This maneuver is simple as well as effective. It needs only one assistant. McRoberts maneuver: Abduct the maternal thighs and sharply hyperflex them onto her abdomen. There is rotation of the symphysis pubis upward and a decrease in the angle of pelvic inclination. This maneuver is effective and is successful in about 90% of cases. Suprapubic pressure may be used together. Wood\u2019s maneuver: General anaesthesia is administered. The posterior shoulder is rotated to the anterior position (180\u00b0) by a corkscrew movement. This is done by inserting two fingers in the posterior vagina. Simultaneous suprapubic pressure is applied. Extraction of the posterior arm: The operator\u2019s hand is introduced into the vagina along the fetal posterior humerus in the sacral hollow. The arm is then swept across the chest and thereafter delivered by gentle traction. This procedure may cause either a fractured clavicle or humerus or both. \u201cAll Fours\u201d Position: Changing the mother onto all fours may increase the pelvic dimensions and allow the fetal position to shift. Downward traction on the posterior shoulder helps to free the impacted shoulder. This may be done for a mobile and slim woman in a community setting.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options A, C and D are false.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Other techniques may be used when all the above maneuvers have failed: Cleidotomy: One or both clavicles may be cut with scissors to reduce the shoulder girth.

The contraindication for the procedure is a short vagina. The principle of this procedure is the fixation of the vaginal vault to the sacrospinous ligament with nonabsorbable sutures . The fixation site is typically the right sacrospinous ligament. However, bilateral fixation is performed in patients with recurrent vault prolapse with the goal of restoring a vaginal axis and sexual life. The routes of entry to the sacrospinous ligament may be posterior and anterior. Usually, a unilateral, right-sided, posterior approach is preferred. This procedure has advantages, including success rates comparable to abdominal procedures, the ability to repair concomitant pelvic floor defects, the absence of laparotomy, shorter hospital stays, and the preservation of vaginal length and function. The most common problem after this procedure is the high rate of postoperative cystocele , which approaches 20% to 33%, resulting from the deviation of the vaginal axis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options B, C and D are false.</p>\n<p></p>",

In a young woman planning to conceive in the near future, the operation is better postponed till after childbirth, because a good surgical result could be ruined by vaginal delivery. Similarly, a pregnant woman with prolapse needs a ring pessary in the first trimester of pregnancy. As the uterus grows abdominally, the prolapse gets reduced, and the pessary can then be removed.

Under the influence of progestogen, the cervical mucus becomes viscid and prevents penetration of sperms into the cervical canal. In addition, the pill inhibits ovulation by 40% and reduces fertility. The low-dose POP (norethisterone 350 mcg, norgestrel 75 mcg or LNG 30 mcg) have been introduced to avoid the side effects of estrogen in the combined pills. The tablet is taken daily without a break. The pill should be started within 5\u20137 days of the menstruation and taken at the same time with a leeway of 3 h on either side of the fixed time each day . If this regime is not observed any day, the woman continues with POP but observes extra precaution s for 48 h. POP is started 21 days postpartum and soon after the The woman needs to take precaution s in the first 48 h of the first cycle. Contraindications: Contraindications to POP are previous ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cysts, breast and genital cancers, abnormal vaginal bleeding, active liver and arterial disease, porphyria, liver tumour, valproate, spironolactone and meprobamate.

It extends from the fetal umbilicus to the fetal surface of the placenta. Development: The umbilical cord is developed from the connective stalk or body stalk which is a band of mesoblastic tissue stretching between the embryonic disc and the chorion. Structures: The constituents of the umbilical cord when fully formed are as follows: Covering epithelium: It is lined by a single layer of amniotic epithelium but shows stratification like that of fetal epidermis at term. Wharton\u2019s jelly: It consists of elongated cells in a gelatinous fluid formed by mucoid degeneration of the extraembryonic mesodermal cells. It is rich in mucopolysaccharides and has got a protective function for the umbilical vessels. Blood vessels: Initially, there are four vessels\u2014two arteries and two veins. The arteries are derived from the internal iliac arteries of the fetus and carry the venous blood from the fetus to the placenta. Of the two umbilical veins, the right one disappears by the 4th month, leaving behind one vein which carries oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetus. The presence of a single umbilical artery is often associated with fetal congenital abnormalities. Remnant of the umbilical vesicle (yolk sac) and its vitel- line duct: Remnant of the yolk sac may be found as a small yellow body near the attachment of the cord to the placenta or on rare occasions, the proximal part of the duct persists as Meckel\u2019s diverticulum. Allantois: A blind tubular structure may be occasionally present near the fetal end which is continuous inside the fetus with its urachus and bladder. Obliterated extraembryonic coelom: In the early period, the intraembryonic coelom is continuous with extraembryonic coelom along with herniation of coils of the intestine (midgut).

The umbilical arteries do not possess an internal elastic lamina but have a well-developed muscular coat. These help in the effective closure of the arteries due to reflex spasms soon after the birth of the baby. Both the arteries and the vein do not possess vasa vasorum.</p>\n<p></p>",

The benefit persists for as long as 18 days.

Rest needs guidance and treatment. They are the waves of vasodilation affecting the face and the neck and these last for 2\u20135  min each. These are followed by severe sweating. Several of these flushes occur during the day but are more severe during the night, and can disturb sleep. They are sometimes preceded by headaches. Palpitation and anginal pains may be felt. Mental depression due to disturbed sleep or otherwise, irritability and lack of concentration are noticed. With the passage of time, the frequency and severity of flushes diminish over a period of 1\u20132 years. They are caused by noradrenaline, which disturbs the thermoregulatory system. Estrogen deficiency reduces hypothalamic endorphins, which release more norepinephrine and serotonin.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Round</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Position of the Uterus : The uterus normally lies in a position of anteversion and anteflexion. The body of the uterus is bent forwards on the cervix approximately at the level of the internal os, and this forward inclination of the body of the uterus on the cervix constitutes anteflexion. The direction of the axis of the cervix depends upon the position of the uterus. In anteversion, the external os is directed downwards and backwards so that on vaginal examination the examining fingers find that the lowest part of the cervix is the anterior lip. When the uterus is retroverted the cervix is directed downwards and forwards , and the lowest part of the cervix is either the external os or the posterior lip. As a result of its normal position of anteflexion, the body of the uterus lies against the bladder. The pouch of the peritoneum that separates the bladder from the uterus is the uterovesical pouch. The peritoneum is reflected from the front of the uterus onto the bladder at the level of the internal os. The uterosacral ligaments are a condensation of the pelvic cellular tissues and lie at a lower level and within the uterosacral folds.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options A, B and C are False.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The pouch of the peritoneum below the level of the uterosacral folds, which is bounded in front by the peritoneum covering the upper part of the posterior vaginal wall and posteriorly by the peritoneum covering the sigmoid colon and the upper end of the rectum, is the pouch of D The posterior fornix of the vagina is in close relation to the peritoneal cavity , as only the posterior vaginal wall and a single layer of peritoneum separate the vagina from the peritoneal cavity. Collection of pus in the pouch of Douglas can therefore be evacuated without difficulty by incising the vagina in the region of the posterior fornix.</p>\n<p></p>",
