In this test the patient is asked to take a full breath to his/her maximum vital capacity and then hold for the maximum time he or she can. If the patient is able to hold breath for > 25 seconds, it indicates that the patient has got good pulmonary reserve. In Mallampati grade II intubation should be easy ASA grading in a directly related outcome. The chances of mortality in ASA I patients is as low as 1 in 1,85,000 which can increase to 10-20% in ASA IV patient</p>\n<p></p>",

If taken as antihypertensives then they should be continued. Neostigmine and pyridostigmine are 2 edge swords. Stopping them can create myasthenia crises. while if we continue them, they can antagonize the effect of muscle relaxants. Therefore, the mid path is to continue but in minimal possible doses.
