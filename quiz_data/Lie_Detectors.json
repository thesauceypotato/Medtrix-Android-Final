      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Polygraph test Polygraph makes a continuous record of blood pressure, pulse, respiration, muscular movements and electrodermal reaction changes in response to stimuli in the form of questions. It is based on the theory, that when the person tells a lie in answer to a question, and there is fear that lies will be detected, the emotion of fear results in stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system which is detected by the polygraph.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Narcoanalysis: (\"truth serum\" drugs): This test involves the intravenous administration of a drug (such as sodium pentothal, sodium seconal, scopolamine and sodium amytal) that causes the subject to enter into various stages of anaesthesia. In the hypnotic stage, the subject becomes less inhibited and is more likely to divulge information, which would usually not be revealed in the conscious state. Option: C. Hypnosis: Many people cannot be hypnotised and many cannot be hypnotised to a deep level. It does not often enhance memory. Hypnotised witnesses produce more fabricated recollections, are more influenced by the interviewer's misleading comments and questions, and are more confident in the accuracy of their recollections, than are non-hypnotised witnesses, even when their recollections are false. Option: D. Word Association: Changes in reaction time of the subject's reply to word stimuli, either visual or auditory, or by the stereotype of answers, or by an exhibition of uncoordinated physical movements, have been employed in attempts to detect deception.</p>\n<p></p>",
