Presence of CMV IgM with low avidity IgG</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 In acute CMV infection, the presence of CMV IgM antibodies along with low avidity IgG is the most reliable indicator. Low avidity IgG indicates recent infection as antibodies haven't yet matured to high binding strength, which typically takes 2-4 months. When combined with positive IgM, this strongly suggests acute primary infection.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. High levels of CMV IgG with high avidity: High avidity IgG indicates past infection, not acute infection, as antibodies have already matured to strong binding strength.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. High levels of CMV IgG with high avidity:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Presence of CMV IgG alone: CMV IgG alone only indicates past exposure to CMV and doesn't differentiate between acute or past infection.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Presence of CMV IgG alone:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. High avidity IgG with negative IgM: This pattern typically indicates past infection with no current reactivation or acute infection.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. High avidity IgG with negative IgM:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The combination of CMV IgM positivity and low avidity IgG provides the strongest evidence for acute primary CMV infection, which is particularly important in pregnant women due to risk of congenital transmission.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

The clinical features include fever, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and neurological symptoms such as altered mental status and sleep disturbances. The presence of trypanosomes with a kinetoplast in the buffy coat further supports the diagnosis, as these organisms are characteristic of trypanosomal infections.

Filariasis: Filariasis is a chronic parasitic infection caused by filarial worms, leading to lymphedema or elephantiasis. It does not present with acute symptoms such as high-grade fever, retro-orbital pain, or thrombocytopenia. Acute presentations are uncommon and typically involve lymphatic inflammation rather than the symptoms described.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.
