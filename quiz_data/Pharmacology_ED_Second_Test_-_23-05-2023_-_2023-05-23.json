Omeprazole and other PPIs work by irreversibly inhibiting the hydrogen/potassium ATPase pump in the stomach lining, which is responsible for the final step in the production of gastric acid. This reduces the amount of acid in the stomach, allowing ulcers to heal and reducing the likelihood of their formation. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analog and is most specific drug for NSAID-induced ulcers. It acts by increasing bicarbonate and mucus production in the stomach, thereby protecting the stomach lining. However, it's often not the first choice due to its side effects (such as diarrhea) and the need for frequent dosing (four times daily). Pirenzepine is a selective M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist that inhibits gastric acid secretion, but it is less effective and commonly used than PPIs or H2 blockers in peptic ulcer disease. Ranitidine is a H2-receptor antagonist and while it also decreases the production of stomach acid, it is not as potent as PPIs like omeprazole.</li><li>\u2022 Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and is generally considered the first-line treatment for peptic ulcer disease, including ulcers that are suspected to have been caused by chronic NSAID (such as aspirin) use.</li><li>\u2022 Omeprazole and other PPIs work by irreversibly inhibiting the hydrogen/potassium ATPase pump in the stomach lining, which is responsible for the final step in the production of gastric acid.

It can cause two types of vomiting. Early vomiting: It occurs within first 24 hours of administration of cisplatin. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists like ondansetron are drug of choice for managing early CINV. Delayed vomiting: It occurs after first day of administration of cisplatin. NK1 receptor anatagonists like aprepitant, netupitant etc are DOC for delayed CINV. Netupitant is a NK1 receptor antagonist and is usually used in combination with a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (like palonosetron) and dexamethasone. It is DOC for delayed CINV associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Ondansetron is often the first choice for managing acute CINV due to its efficacy and tolerability. Metoclopramide, a dopamine receptor antagonist, may be used to manage CINV, but it's generally not as effective as the 5-HT3 antagonists. Prochlorperazine is also used to manage CINV, but it's not generally the first choice because of its potential to cause extrapyramidal symptoms.</li><li>\u2022 Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent that is associated with a high risk of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).
