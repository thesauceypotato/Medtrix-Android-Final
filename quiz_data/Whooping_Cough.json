Whooping cough is caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, tiny germ-laden droplets are sprayed into the air and breathed into the lungs of anyone who happens to be nearby. Polysaccharide (PS) capsules are important virulence determinants for many bacterial pathogens. Bordetella pertussis, the agent of whooping cough, produces a surface-associated microcapsule but its role in pertussis pathogenesis remains unknown.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option C.
