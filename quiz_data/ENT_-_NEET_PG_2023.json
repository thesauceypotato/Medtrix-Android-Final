A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the patient\u2019s mastoid and when he stops hearing, it is brought beside the meatus. If he still hears, AC is more than BC. Alternatively, the patient is asked to compare the loudness of sound heard through air and bone conduction. Rinne test is called positive when AC is longer or louder than BC. It is seen in normal persons or those having sensorineural deafness. A negative Rinne (BC > AC) is seen in conductive deafness. A negative Rinne indicates a minimum air-bone gap of 15\u201320 dB. A prediction of air-bone gap can be made if tuning forks of 256, 512 and 1024 Hz are used. A Rinne test equal or negative for 256 Hz but positive for 512 Hz indicates air-bone gap of 20\u201330 dB.

Its incidence is high in AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) patients. The lesion appears as a reddish purple nodule or a plaque mostly on the palate. Microscopically, it consists of spindle cells with haemorrhagic cleft-like spaces. Treatment is not satisfactory. Kaposi sarcoma in non-AIDS patients may respond to chemotherapy but its response in patients suffering from AIDS is poor In the oral cavity, Kaposi sarcoma is mostly seen in the palate, but may occur on the tongue or gingiva or on the posterior wall of the pharynx. It appears purplish in colour and may need to be differentiated from angioma or pyogenic granuloma. It can occur at any stage of HIV infection, even in those with normal CD4 counts.</p>\n<p></p>",

It can arise from the parotid, submandibular or other minor salivary glands. In the parotid it usually arises from its tail. It can also arise from the deep lobe of the parotid and present as a parapharyngeal tumour in the oropharynx. Pleomorphic adenomas are slow-growing tumours and may be quite large at initial presentation. They are usually seen in the third or fourth decade, with propensity for females. They are called \u201c mixed tumours \u201d because both epithelial and mesenchymal elements are seen in histol- ogy. The stroma of the tumour may be mucoid, fibroid, vascular, myxochondroid or chondroid and its proportion to the epithelial element may vary. Though tumour is encapsulated, it sends pseudopods into the surrounding gland which are left behind if the tumour is simply shelled out. It is therefore essential that surgical excision of the tumour should include normal gland tissue around it. In the parotid, it amounts to superficial parotidectomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION B- Jaw tumours are relatively rare growths or lesions that develop in the jawbone or the soft tissues in the mouth and face. OPTION C - Dermoid cysts are slow growing benign lesions. They are mostly seen on the scalp and skull. It is made up of hair, teeth, cartilage and skin glands. OPTION D- A sebaceous cyst is derived from hair follicle infundibulum  or traumatic inclusion. The most common site of sebaceous cyst is postauricular sulcus or below or behind the ear lobule. It may ooze out foul smelling, cheese like discharge.</p>\n<p></p>",
