Otosclerosis is a condition in which there is a bony overgrowth of the stapes footplate that results in conductive hearing loss. Ear drainage would not be present. Option: D. Meniere's disease is a condition associated with an accumulation of fluid in the inner ear that leads to hearing loss, vertigo, and tinnitus. The presence of ear drainage and the lack of vertigo make Meniere's disease unlikely in this case.</p>\n<p></p>",
