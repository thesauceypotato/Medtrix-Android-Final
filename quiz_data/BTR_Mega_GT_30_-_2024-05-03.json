The patient has seen several doctors over the past few years for his \"huge pimples\" and has tried multiple non-prescription acne preparations without benefit. He spends hours a day checking his skin in the mirror for new pimples and scars and researching the latest acne treatments. He avoids socializing and dating due to fears of being rejected based on his appearance. The patient purposely styles his hair to conceal his forehead and cheeks. He has no medical history. Vital signs are within normal limits. The patient is wearing a baseball cap and hesitantly removes it. Physical examination shows a small papule on his forehead and a few closed comedones on his nose that are noticeable only on close inspection. His skin is otherwise clear without scarring or hyperpigmentation. Which of the following is the most appropriate management for this patient?",
