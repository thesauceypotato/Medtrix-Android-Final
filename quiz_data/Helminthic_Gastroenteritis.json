He had jaundice a few days back which resolved spontaneously. He was not having constipation, obstipation, or diarrhea. On clinical examination, he was febrile (101 \u00b0F), icteric, and well-hydrated. His per-abdomen examination was normal except for tender hepatomegaly. His laboratory parameters were Hb 10.4 g%, TLC 12,300/cc, and serum bilirubin 6.98 mg/dl (direct 6.42 mg/dl). His transaminases were mildly elevated and serum alkaline phosphatase was normal. He had a normal serum amylase level and coagulation profile. His X-ray abdomen did show dilated bowel loops with multiple air-fluid levels observed. He has a history of prior laparotomy and the imaging findings, an adhesive small bowel obstruction was thought to be the etiology, and he was brought to the operating theatre for exploratory laparotomy. Photograph of a segment of resected ileum with adult worms retrieved from the lumen. The specimen was also sent for ova and parasite examination.
