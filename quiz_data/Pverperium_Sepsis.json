Fortunately, prophylactic antibiotic prophylaxis has decreased the incidence and severity of the post-cesarean section more than any other intervention in the past 30 years. A single dose is administered in all women undergoing C-sections. Hence option D is the correct choice. Other options do not have any proven role in preventing puerperal infection.</p>\n<p></p>",

With vaginal delivery, the incidence rates are almost 1-2 percent. This rate rises to 5-6 percent with ruptured membranes, prolonged labor, and multiple pv examinations . If intrapartum chorioamnionitis is present, the risk can be up to 13 percent. Hence both options B and C will have around the same rate compared to NVD (option A )</p>\n<p></p>",
