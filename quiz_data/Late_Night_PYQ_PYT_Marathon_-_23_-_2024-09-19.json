In this scenario, the patient scores 2 for eye opening to pain (E2), non-testable (NT) for verbal due to intubation, and 3 for abnormal flexion (M3). Thus, the GCS score is recorded as E2VNTM3. Non-testability (NT) denotes the inability to assess the verbal component due to intubation, often seen in acute TBI cases. The GCS-P score further refines this evaluation by considering pupillary activity, enhancing prognostic accuracy. While this patient\u2019s GCS score focuses on eye and motor responses, her reactive pupils indicate no additional pupillary penalty in the GCS-P calculation.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

These drugs can cause congenital anomalies, including aplasia cutis congenita, a condition characterized by localized absence of skin, commonly on the scalp. To minimize these risks, Propylthiouracil (PTU) is recommended during the first trimester as it has a lower teratogenic profile. After 16 weeks of gestation, the treatment typically switches to Methimazole or Carbimazole because PTU is associated with hepatotoxicity, which is more concerning later in pregnancy.
