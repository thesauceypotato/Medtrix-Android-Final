Diplacusis is the perception of a single auditory stimulus as sounds of different pitch in both the ears. Tullio\u2019s phenomenon is where loud sounds produce vertigo. Early Meniere\u2019s affects lower frequency first. SP/AP potential greater than 0.4 or 0.5 are consistent with the diagnosis of Meniere\u2019s disease. Audiogram in early Meniere\u2019s Disease. Hearing loss is sensorineural and more in lower frequencies \u2013 the rising curve.

There is improvement in vertigo, tinnitus and ear fullness and hearing. Intermittent positive pressure waves can be delivered through an instrument called Meniett device which has been approved by FDA. Prerequisite: Myringotomy and insert a ventilation tube so that the device when coupled to the external ear canal can deliver pressure waves to the round window membrane via the ventilation tube. Pressure waves pass through the perilymph and cause reduction in endolymph pressure by redistributing it through various communication channels such as the endolymphatic sac or the blood vessels</p>\n<p></p>",
