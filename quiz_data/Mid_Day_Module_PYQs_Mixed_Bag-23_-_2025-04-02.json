A) Anovulation</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Anovulation is the most common cause of puberty menorrhagia. Menorrhagia refers to heavy menstrual bleeding that occurs in a regular cycle. In adolescents, anovulation, which is the failure of the ovary to release an oocyte during a menstrual cycle, frequently leads to heavy or prolonged bleeding due to the lack of a normal hormonal cycle that regulates the endometrial lining. Without the usual cyclical hormonal fluctuations, the endometrial lining may become excessively thick, leading to heavy bleeding when it sheds. This condition is typical in puberty due to the body's ongoing adjustment to hormonal regulation.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Endometriosis : Endometriosis involves the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which can cause painful menstruation and potentially contribute to menorrhagia. However, it is less common than anovulation as the primary cause of menorrhagia in adolescents.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Endometriosis</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Malignancy : Malignancy is a rare cause of menorrhagia in puberty. While malignancy can lead to abnormal bleeding, it is not the most common cause in this age group.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Malignancy</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
