Although it occurs in a number of contexts, it is by far the most common in patients with AIDS ; indeed, its presence is used as a criterion for the diagnosis of AIDS . Based on population demographics and risk factors, KS is categorized into four forms : Classic KS is a disorder of older men . It can be associated with malignancy or altered immunity , but it is NOT associated with HIV Classic KS manifests as multiple red-purple skin plaques or nodules , usually in the distal lower extremities ; these progressively increase in size and number and spread proximally . Although persistent, the tumors are typically asymptomatic and remain localized to the skin and subcutaneous tissue. B typically occurs in HIV seronegative individuals younger than age 40 years and can follow an indolent or aggressive course; it involves lymph nodes much more frequently than the classic variant. Transplant-associated KS occurs in solid-organ transplant recipients receiving T-cell immunosuppression; the risk can be 100-fold greater than for immunocompetent patients. Transplant-associated KS typically follows an aggressive course involving lymph nodes , mucosa , and viscera ; cutaneous lesions may be absent. Lesions can regress as immunosuppression is reduced but at the risk of organ rejection. AIDS-associated (epidemic) KS is an AIDS-defining illness ; worldwide, it represents the Most Common HIV-related malignancy . Although the incidence of KS has fallen more than 80% with the advent of aggressive antiretroviral therapies, it still occurs in HIV-infected individuals 300-fold more commonly than in transplant recipients and 1000-fold greater than in the general population. AIDS-associated KS often involves lymph nodes and disseminates widely to viscera early in its course; most patients eventually die of opportunistic infections rather than KS . Cutaneous lesions may occur alone or with visceral lesions of the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system. The presence of extensive oral Kaposi sarcoma, as seen in this patient, is associated with a poor prognosis .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Angiosarcomas are malignant endothelial neoplasms. Option: B. Hemangiopericytomas are rare tumors derived from pericytes surrounding the blood vessels and are mostly malignant . Option: C. Bacillary angiomatosis. Bacillary angiomatosis is a vascular proliferation in immunocompromised hosts (e.g., patients with AIDS by opportunistic bacilli of the Bartonella family . Lesions can involve the skin, bone, brain, and other organs. The infections (and lesions) are cleared by antibiotics .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Classic KS is a disorder of older men . It can be associated with malignancy or altered immunity , but it is NOT associated with HIV Classic KS manifests as multiple red-purple skin plaques or nodules , usually in the distal lower extremities ; these progressively increase in size and number and spread proximally . Although persistent, the tumors are typically asymptomatic and remain localized to the skin and subcutaneous tissue. B typically occurs in HIV seronegative individuals younger than age 40 years and can follow an indolent or aggressive course; it involves lymph nodes much more frequently than the classic variant. Transplant-associated KS occurs in solid-organ transplant recipients receiving T-cell immunosuppression; the risk can be 100-fold greater than for immunocompetent patients. Transplant-associated KS typically follows an aggressive course involving lymph nodes , mucosa , and viscera ; cutaneous lesions may be absent. Lesions can regress as immunosuppression is reduced but at the risk of organ rejection. AIDS-associated (epidemic) KS is an AIDS-defining illness ; worldwide, it represents the Most Common HIV-related malignancy . Although the incidence of KS has fallen more than 80% with the advent of aggressive antiretroviral therapies, it still occurs in HIV-infected individuals 300-fold more commonly than in transplant recipients and 1000-fold greater than in the general population. AIDS-associated KS often involves lymph nodes and disseminates widely to viscera early in its course; most patients eventually die of opportunistic infections rather than KS . Cutaneous lesions may occur alone or with visceral lesions of the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system. The presence of extensive oral Kaposi sarcoma, as seen in this patient, is associated with a poor prognosis . In classic KS (and sometimes in other variants), the cutaneous lesions progress through three stages : Patches are red-purple macules . Histology shows dilated irregular Endothelial cell-lined vascular spaces with interspersed lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages (sometimes containing hemosiderin ). The lesions can be difficult to distinguish from granulation tissue. With time, lesions become larger, violaceous, raised plaques composed of dermal accumulations of dilated, jagged vascular channels lined and surrounded by plump spindle cells . Scattered between the vascular channels are extravasated erythrocytes, hemosiderin -laden macrophages, and other mononuclear inflammatory cells. Eventually, lesions become nodular and more distinctly neoplastic . These lesions are composed of sheets of plump, proliferating spindle cells, mostly in the dermis or subcutaneous tissues , containing small vessels and slitlike spaces with red cells. Marked hemorrhage, hemosiderin pigment, and mononuclear inflammation are present; mitotic figures are common, as are round, pink, cytoplasmic globules representing degenerating erythrocytes within phagolysosomes. The nodular stage often heralds lymph nodes and visceral involvement . Kaposi sarcoma. (A) Gross photograph illustrating coalescent red-purple macules and plaques of the skin.

Older adults, males, and females , are more commonly affected; angiosarcomas occur at any site, but most often involve skin, soft tissue, breast, and liver. Angiosarcomas can also arise in the setting of lymphedema, classically in the ipsilateral upper extremity several years after radical mastectomy for breast cancer (i.e. after lymph node resection and/or radiation) ; in such cases, the tumor presumably arises from lymphatic vessels (lymphangiosarcoma) . Angiosarcomas have also been induced by radiation and are rarely associated with prolonged insertion of foreign material (e.g., prosthetic devices) . Hepatic angiosarcomas are associated with a variety of carcinogenic exposures including Arsenic (e.g., in pesticides), Thorotrast (a radioactive contrast agent formerly used for radiologic imaging), and polyvinyl chloride (one of the best-known examples of human chemical carcinogenesis). All of these agents have long latencies between initial exposure and eventual tumor development. Angiosarcomas are locally invasive and can readily metastasize , with 5-year survival rates of approximately 30%. Angiosarcoma. (A) Angiosarcoma involving the right ventricle.
