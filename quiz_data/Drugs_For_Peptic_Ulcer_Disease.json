Sucralfate is not greatly absorbed into the body through the digestive tract. It works mainly in the lining of the stomach by adhering to ulcer sites and protecting them from acids, enzymes, and bile salts. Sucralfate is used to treat an active duodenal ulcer. Option: D. Antidiuretic hormone ( ADH), arginine vasopressin (AVP) or argipressin, is a hormone synthesized from the AVP gene as a peptide prohormone in neurons in the hypothalamus, and is converted to AVP.

It has also been defined as an increased amount of saliva in the mouth, which may also be caused by decreased clearance of saliva. Hypersalivation can contribute to drooling Option: D. Bronchial asthma While there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can typically be improved. The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as cigarette smoke, pets, or other allergens, and eliminating exposure to them.

This is the result of virtual 100% acid suppression. The drugs though have an average half-life of 1 hour, but the effect of acid suppression lasts for about 2 days or so. Drugs are very well tolerated. Usual side effects are nausea, abdominal pain, and very rarely pneumonitis due to prolonged acid suppression. Sometimes, breakthrough pain occurs during therapy. This can be managed by antacids Remember: PPI is known as HIT & RUN drugs because of their long duration of action, bind irreversibly to Na+K+ ATPase PPI Mechanisms of Action All PPIs are prodrugs that are converted to active moeity (sulfenamide form) in presence of acid Sulfenamide binds covalently to exposed cysteine residues of H+/K+-ATPase pump Currently available PPIs have pK (pH at which 50% of molecule is protonated) ranging from 3.8 to 5.0 Higher pK, results in more rapid and complete activation, especially at pH above 1-2 PPI concentration may be up to 1000-fold higher on luminal side of secretory canaliculus</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. pro drug: A prodrug is a pharmacologically inactive medication or compound that, after intake, is metabolized (i.e., converted within the body) into a pharmacologically active Instead of administering a drug directly, a corresponding prodrug can be used to improve how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted (ADME).

After diffusing into the parietal cell from blood, it gets concentrated in the acidic pH of the canaliculi because the charged forms generated there are unable to diffuse back. Moreover, it gets tightly bound to the enzyme. These features and the specific localization of H+K+ATP ase to the apical membrane of the parietal cells confer high degree of selectivity of action to omeprazole. Acid secretion resumes only when new H+K+ATP ase molecules are synthesized. It also inhibits gastric mucosal carbonic anhydrase.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
