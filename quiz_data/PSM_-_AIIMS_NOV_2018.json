Option C. A t-test is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic follows a Student's t-distribution under the null hypothesis. It is most commonly applied when the test statistic would follow a normal distribution if the value of a scaling term in the test statistic were known (typically, the scaling term is unknown and therefore a nuisance parameter). Option D. ANOVA is to test for differences among the means of the population by examining the amount of variation within each sample, relative to the amount of variation between the samples.  Analyzing variance tests the hypothesis that the means of two or more populations are equal.</p>\n<p></p>",
