It is given intramuscularly at a dose of 15 mg/kg once every 30 days in a series of 5 monthly intramuscular injections to infants and children during the Respiratory Syncytial Virus RSV season. Although not recommended for routine prophylaxis, it can be considered for high-risk infants during the RSV season (such as children < 2 years of age who require medical therapy for chronic lung disease or CHD).</p>\n<p></p>",

It is associated with a Th2 type of immune response, as most features of the disease are consistent with Th2 cytokines-driven inflammation. Short-acting beta agonists (SABA) are used primarily as rescue therapy for severe symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids are the gold standard of asthma maintenance treatment, although there is considerable evidence of their benefits when used in the initial asthma therapy as well. Inhaled long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) should not be used in young children and there is considerable evidence that their monotherapy could expose children to serious adverse events. In older children, they are usually administered in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.</p>\n<p></p>",
