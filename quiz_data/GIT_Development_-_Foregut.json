Pancreatic divisum is also a cause of acute pancreatitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Pancreatic divisum is a congenital anomaly in the anatomy of the ducts of the pancreas in which a single pancreatic duct is not formed, but rather remains as two distinct dorsal and ventral ducts. Most individuals with pancreas divisum remain without symptoms or complications. A minority of people with pancreatic divisum may develop episodes of abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting due to acute or chronic pancreatitis. The human embryo begins life with two ducts in the pancreas, the ventral duct and the dorsal duct. Normally, the two ducts will fuse together to form one main pancreatic duct; this occurs in more than 90% of embryos. In approximately 10% of embryos the ventral and dorsal ducts fail to fuse together, resulting in pancreas divisum.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B . Annular pancreas Annular pancreas results from growth of a bifid ventral pancreatic bud around the duodenum, where the parts of the bifid ventral bud fuse with the dorsal bud, forming a pancreatic ring and is less common than pancreatic divisum. Option C . Both A & B Option D . None of the above Annular pancreas results from growth of a bifid ventral pancreatic bud around the duodenum, where the parts of the bifid ventral bud fuse with the dorsal bud, forming a pancreatic ring and is less common than pancreatic divisum. Pancreatic divisum is a congenital anomaly in which a single pancreatic duct is not formed, but rather remains as two distinct dorsal and ventral ducts.Pancreatic divisum is also a cause of acute pancreatitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Annular pancreas : In this condition, the pancreatic tissue completely surrounds the second part of the duode- num causing its obstruction. This anomaly is produced as follows: The bifid ventral pancreatic bud fails to fuse to form a single mass. The two lobes (right and left) of the ventral pancreatic bud grow and migrate in opposite directions around the second part of the duodenum and form a collar of pancreatic tissue before it fuses with the dorsal pancreatic bud. Thus, duodenum gets completely surrounded by the pancreatic tissue that may cause duodenal obstruction. Clinical Features Option A: Vomiting may start a few hours after birth. Option B: Radiograph of abdomen reveals double\u2013bubble appear- ance. It is associated with duodenal stenosis. It is due to gas in the stomach and dilated part of the duodenum proximal to the site of obstruction. Early surgical intervention to relieve the obstruction is necessary. The surgical procedure consists of duodenum\u2013 jejunostomy and not cutting of the pancreatic collar.</p>\n<p></p>",
