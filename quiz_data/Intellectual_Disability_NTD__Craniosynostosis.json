The neural tube is open at both ends for a brief period, and the neural canal communicates freely with the amniotic cavity.

The abnormality, which represents a spectrum of severity, is classified into three groups: alobar, semilobar, and lobar, depending on the degree of the cleavage abnormality Facial abnormalities, including cyclopia, synophthalmia, cebocephaly, single nostril, choanal atresia, solitary central incisor tooth, and premaxillary agenesis are common in severe cases</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B. Encephalocele - Protusion of brain tissue(cerebral cortex,cerebellum or brain stem) through a cranial defect Option C. Anencephaly - distinctive appearance with a large defect of calvarium, meninges, and scalp associated with a rudimentary brain Failure of development of cerebral hemisphere and cerebellum. only a residue of the brainstem can be identified Option D. Iniencephaly - Accentuated retroflexion of neck, varying degree of defect in occiput and upper spine and nearly absent neck</p>\n<p></p>",
