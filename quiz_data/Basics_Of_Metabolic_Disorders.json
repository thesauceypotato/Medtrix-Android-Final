It is a self-limiting disorder characterised by soft tissue swelling, rapid subperiosteal  new bone formation, cortical thickening of underlying bones, fever and irritability. B.     Classically, the disease's onset occurs before the 5th month of life, with a resolution by three years of age. C.    In sporadic cases, the mandible is the most common site of involvement, presenting as jaw tumor or swelling, i.e., firm, tender without heat or redness. D.   Presence of raised ESR & alkaline phosphatase & anemia mimic infection E.    Tibia> ulna is most frequently involved in the familial form. Presentation \u25cf        Seen in infants and young children. \u25cf        It starts during the \ufb01rst few months of life with painful swelling over the tubular bones and the mandible. \u25cf        Etiology: idiopathic Clinical features: Child presents with \u25cf Fever and irritability, \u25cf        Refusing to move the affected limb \u25cf Swelling is present with no local signs of in\ufb02ammation.

They are radiolucent on x-ray. The osteoclasts consume the trabecular bone that osteoblasts lay down. This front of reparative bone deposition, followed by additional resorption, can expand beyond the usual shape of the bone, involving the periosteum and causing bone pain. The characteristic brown colouration results from hemosiderin deposition into the osteolytic cysts. Also typical of giant cell tumours of the bone.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. - Brown tumours are tumors of bone that arise in settings of excess osteoclast activity, such as hyperparathyroidism, not hypoparathyroidism.
