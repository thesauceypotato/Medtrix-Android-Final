Sometimes, remnants of the primitive streak persist in the sacrococcygeal region. These clusters of pluripotent cells proliferate and form tumours, known as sacrococcygeal teratomas, which commonly contain tissues derived from all three germ layers. It is a tumour that develops before birth and grows from a baby's coccyx, more commonly known as the tailbone.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Sacrococcygeal teratoma is the most common tumour in newborns, occurring with a frequency of 1 in 37,000.

Cloacal membrane Patients with cloacal malformation may have abnormal development in other organ systems. These abnormalities may affect the spine (Vertebral) or cause Anorectal malformations, heart defects (Cardiac), Trachea-Esophageal fistula and/or atresia, or Renal and Limb abnormalities Option C. Notochord The above case is Sacrococcygeal teratoma that occurs due to the PGCs (primordial germ cells) in the persistent caudal end of the primitive streak and not due to notochord deformity. Split notochord syndrome is a rare neural tube malformation involving the brain, spinal cord, and vertebral column. Option D . Closure of caudal neuropore The caudal neuropore closes during stage 12, generally when 25 somatic pairs are present. The site of final closure is at the level of future somite 31, which corresponds to the second sacral vertebral level. Non-closure of the neuropore may be important in the genesis of spina bifida.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The most characteristic event occurring during the third week of gestation is gastrulation , the process that establishes all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) in the Gastrulation begins with the formation of the primitive streak on the surface of the epiblast.</p>\n<p></p>",

In cases of delayed presentation with anorectal constipation, manometry may be useful in distinguishing short/ultrashort segment Hirschsprung disease from other causes. A definitive diagnosis requires a full-thickness rectal biopsy (2 cm above the dentate line as the region below the dentate line usually is aganglionic).</p>\n<p></p>",
