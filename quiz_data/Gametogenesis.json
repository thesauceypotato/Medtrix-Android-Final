Formation of hypoblast : Some cells of the inner cell mass differentiate into flattened cells that come to line its free surface (Image A). This layer is the hypoblast/endoderm. Formation of epiblast : The remaining cells of the inner cell mass become columnar (Image B). These cells form the epiblast/ectoderm. The embryo is now in the form of a disc having two layers ( Bilaminar germ disc). Formation of amniotic cavity : A space appears between the epiblast (below) and the trophoblast (above). This is the amniotic cavity (Image C), filled by amniotic fluid, or liquor amnii. The roof of this cavity is formed by amniogenic cells derived from the trophoblast, while its floor is formed by the epiblast. Formation of primary yolk sac : Flattened cells arising from the hypoblast, spread and line the inside of the blastocystic cavity. (This lining of flattened cells is called \u201cHeuser\u2019s membrane\u201d ). In this way, a cavity, lined on all sides by cells of endodermal origin, is formed. This cavity is called the primary yolk sac.

These cells also separate the wall of the amniotic cavity from the trophoblast. This mesoderm is called \u201cextra-embryonic\u201d because it lies outside the embryonic disc. It does not give rise to any tissues of the embryo.</p>\n<p></p>",
