The labels were designed in response to the problem of delivering vaccines to developing countries where the cold chain is difficult to preserve, and where formerly vaccines were being rendered inactive and administered ineffectively due to their having been denatured by exposure to ambient temperature. If temperature is maintained properly inner square always remains white. If temperature is not maintained, inner square colour doesn\u2019t remain white, it becomes darker. It has 4 grades. We can use grade 1 & 2 vaccines - i.e. inner square is lighter than outer square. When square colour matches circle colour or is darker, do not use the vaccine. It is a marker of cold chain maintenance.

Option A. Coefficient of variation (CV) is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. The higher the coefficient of variation, the greater the level of dispersion around the mean. It is generally expressed as a percentage. Option C. Variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. In other words, it measures how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value. Variance computation is used to build standard deviation and other statistical functions. To measure spread, variance calculates the mean of all values in the sample. For each input value in the set, the difference of the value from the mean is computed, and this difference is squared. Option D. The interquartile range is a measure of where the \u201cmiddle fifty\u201d is in a data set. Where a range is a measure of where the beginning and end are in a set, an interquartile range is a measure of where the bulk of the values lie. That\u2019s why it\u2019s preferred over many other measures of spreadwhen reporting things like school performance or test scores.</p>\n<p></p>",

The most common method of transmission is through direct contact with infected urine or other bodily fluids such as saliva, or contaminated water, soil, or food. This bacteria can enter the body through skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth) especially if skin is broken with cut or scratch. Outbreaks are most commonly associated with contaminated water such as flood waters. Person to person transmission of this bacteria is rare. Both wild and domestic animals can be carriers of this bacteria, this includes but is not limited to: cattle, pigs, horses, dogs, rodents, and wild animals.
