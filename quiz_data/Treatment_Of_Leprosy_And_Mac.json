      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dapsone It causes anemia and can increase/decompensate pre-existing anemia If hemoglobin is less than ten gm%, start iron, folic acid, and ascorbic acid and advise the person to take a high protein diet along with MDT</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Adverse effects Dapsone is generally well tolerated at 100 mg/day or less. Mild haemolytic anaemia is common. This is a dose-related toxicity\u2014that reflects oxidising property of the drug. Patients with G-6-PD deficiency are more susceptible; doses > 50 mg/day produce haemolysis in such subjects. Gastric intolerance\u2014nausea and anorexia are frequent initially but decrease later. Other side effects are methemoglobinaemia, headache, paresthesias, mental symptoms, and drug fever. Cutaneous reactions include itching, allergic rashes, fixed drug eruption, hypermelanosis, phototoxicity, and rarely exfoliative dermatitis. Hepatitis and agranulocytosis are rare complications.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Rifampicin \u2013 orange, red discoloration of urine, flu-like symptoms. Option: B. Clofazimine - reddish-black discoloration of the skin, especially on exposed parts Option: D. Minocycline Vertigo is the only serious complication of its long-term use</p>\n<p></p>",
