Many migraine medications, particularly triptans (such as sumatriptan), work by activating serotonin (5-HT1) receptors, which not only relieve migraine symptoms but also cause vasoconstriction of blood vessels, including coronary arteries. This vasoconstriction can exacerbate ischemic heart disease and lead to angina or other ischemic symptoms, especially in patients with a known history of coronary artery disease.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Decreased platelet aggregation: This is incorrect because decreased platelet aggregation would theoretically reduce the risk of ischemic events rather than provoke chest pain. Medications like aspirin work through this mechanism but are not associated with triggering ischemic symptoms.</li><li>\u2022 Option</li><li>\u2022 B. Decreased platelet aggregation:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Peripheral vasodilation: This is incorrect because peripheral vasodilation would decrease afterload and improve blood flow, which typically helps alleviate chest pain rather than cause it.

Opioids act on mu-opioid receptors in the brainstem, leading to suppression of the respiratory centers and resulting in decreased respiratory drive, shallow breathing, and hypoxia. The hallmark signs of opioid toxicity include pinpoint pupils, decreased respiratory rate, and altered mental status. Early recognition and treatment with naloxone, an opioid antagonist, are crucial to rapidly reverse respiratory depression and restore normal breathing.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Sedative overdose: This option is incorrect because the presentation is more specific to opioid toxicity rather than a general sedative effect. While sedatives can cause respiratory depression, pinpoint pupils are characteristic of opioid overdose.</li><li>\u2022 Option</li><li>\u2022 B. Sedative overdose:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Pulmonary embolism: This option is incorrect as pulmonary embolism typically presents with sudden-onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and tachycardia.

Pulmonary embolism:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Airway obstruction: This is incorrect because airway obstruction usually presents with stridor, wheezing, or evidence of choking.

Melanosis coli is typically benign and results from the accumulation of apoptotic macrophages in the colonic lamina propria. The pigmentation is usually brownish-black and appears most prominently in the proximal colon. This condition is often associated with long-term use of stimulant laxatives, such as Senna, cascara sagrada, and bisacodyl.
