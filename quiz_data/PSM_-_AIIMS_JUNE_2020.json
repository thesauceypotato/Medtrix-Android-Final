      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Ordinal It is ordinal because the values can be meaningfully ordered, and it is categorical because each value is assigned to a specific category. Notice two things about this variable, which is typical of all ordinal variables: The data do not have any units of measurement (so the same as that for nominal variables). The ordering of the categories is not arbitary, as it is with nominal variables.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Categorical Data Nominal Categorical Data : Nominal data are \"nominal\" because it usually relates to named things, such as occupation, blood type, or ethnicity. It is particularly not numeric. It is \"categorical\" because we allocate each value to a specific category. Therefore, for example, we allocate each M value to the category Male and each F value to the category Female. Notice two things about this data, which is typical of all nominal data: The data do not have any units of measurement. The ordering of the categories is arbitary. In other words, the categories cannot be ordered in any meaningful way. Ordinal Categorical Data: Let's now consider data from the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). As the name suggests, this scale is used to assess the level of consciousness after head injury. A patient's GCS score is judged by the sum of responses in three areas: eye opening response, verbal response, and motor response. Notice particuarly that these responses are assessed rather than measured (as weight, height or temperature would be). The GCS score can vary from 3 (deeply unconscious) to 15 (fully conscious). In other words, there are 13 possible categories of consciousness. Suppose that we have two motor-cyclists, let us call them Wayne and Kylie, who have been admitted to the Emergency Department with head injuries following a road traffic accident. Wayne has a GCS of 5 and Kylie a GCS of 10. We can say the Wayne's level of consciousness is less than that of Kylie (so we can order the values) but we can't say exactly by how much. We certainly cannot say that Wayne is exactly half as conscious as Kylie. Moreover, the levels of consciousness between adjacent scores are not necessarily the same; for example, the difference in the levels of consciousness between two patients with GCS scores of 10 and 11 may not be the same as that between patients with scores of 11 and 12. It's therefore important to recognise that we cannot quantify these differences.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options A, B and D are false.</p>\n<p></p>",

In settings where Airborne Precautions cannot be implemented due to limited engineering resources, masking the patient and placing the patient in a private room with the door closed will reduce the likelihood of airborne transmission until the patient is either transferred to a facility with an AIIR or returned home. Restrict susceptible healthcare personnel from entering the room of patients known or suspected to have measles , chickenpox, disseminated zoster, or smallpox if other immune healthcare personnel are available. Use personal protective equipment (PPE) appropriately, including a fit-tested NIOSH-approved N95 or higher level respirator for healthcare personnel. Limit transport and movement of patients outside of the room to medically-necessary purposes. If transport or movement outside an AIIR is necessary, instruct patients to wear a surgical mask, if possible, and observe Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette. Healthcare personnel transporting patients who are on Airborne Precautions do not need to wear a mask or respirator during transport if the patient is wearing a mask and infectious skin lesions are covered.

These populations are also referred to as \"sentinel groups\". With HSS, the trends in HIV infection are monitored over the period of time by group and by site. The HSS system is one of the components of the second generation HIV surveillance in India. Over the years, the emphasis of HSS in India was on heterosexual transmission, so, the sentinel sites were mainly at Antenatal Clinics (ANC) and Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) clinics , to observe the trends and levels of HIV in general population and among people with high risk behavior, respectively. Primarily from 2003 onwards, the sentinel surveillance started tracking the trends and levels in core risk groups, namely, Men having Sex with Men (MSM), Female Sex Worker (FSW) and Injecting Drug Users (IDU). Surveillance was gradually introduced in other population groups at risk such as, single male migrants and long distance truckers . Additionally, from 2003 surveillance was initiated in some ANC clinics at sub district level as well. The number of sentinel sites have increased from 164 in 1998 to 1134 in 2007. This has called for separate sections on methods in the operational guidelines for facility based surveillance ( ANC attendees and STD patients) and TI based surveillance (high risk behavior populations).\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options A, B and C are false.</p>\n<p></p>",

They can be seen anywhere in the genitalia including in the perianal region even in those denying anal sexual intercourse. The other commonly recognized manifestation of genital HPV infection is cervical cancer, caused by some sub-types of HPV. Treatment is generally reserved for large lesions because sub-clinical infection tends to resolve on their own. For any viral infection the mainstay of control is prevention, especially in young sexually active individuals. Regular examination of the cervix and cervical cytology using Papanicolaou staining method is recommended for female patients and female contacts in order to detect progression of lesions to cervical cancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options B, C and D are false.</p>\n<p></p>",
