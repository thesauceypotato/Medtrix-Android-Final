Phenytoin is primarily metabolized through hepatic oxidation, mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2C9. It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism rather than acetylation. On the other hand, the other drugs mentioned are metabolized by acetylation: Isoniazid (Choice A) is an antituberculosis medication that undergoes rapid acetylation in the liver. Acetylation plays a significant role in the metabolism of isoniazid, and variations in acetylation rates can impact its therapeutic efficacy and side effects. Hydralazine (Choice B), an antihypertensive drug, is also metabolized by acetylation. Acetylation is a major pathway involved in the elimination of hydralazine from the body. Procainamide (Choice C), an antiarrhythmic medication, undergoes extensive acetylation for its metabolism. Acetylation is a major metabolic pathway for procainamide, and acetylator phenotype variations can affect the drug's efficacy and potential toxicity. Therefore, the drug that is NOT metabolized by acetylation among the options provided is phenytoin (Choice D). It is primarily metabolized through hepatic oxidation rather than acetylation.</li><li>\u2022 Among the drugs mentioned, phenytoin is not metabolized by acetylation.

The treatment should not be discontinued immediately once haemoglobin normalizes to prevent recurrence of iron deficiency anaemia.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 When treating iron deficiency anemia with oral iron supplements , it is essential to understand that the body absorbs about 10-20% of the elemental iron from these supplements , meaning that from a dose of 200-300 mg, around 20-60 mg is absorbed . As hemoglobin levels improve, the efficiency of iron absorption decreases due to the body's natural regulatory mechanisms to prevent iron overload. An effective response to treatment is indicated by an increase in reticulocyte count , typically observed within 2 weeks and peaking at 4 weeks. Importantly, iron supplementation should continue for 3-6 months after hemoglobin normalization to ensure complete replenishment of iron stores and prevent the recurrence of anemia, highlighting that stopping treatment immediately after normalization is incorrect. Understanding these principles helps in the effective management of iron deficiency anemia and in preventing its recurrence.</li><li>\u27a4 iron deficiency anemia</li><li>\u27a4 oral iron supplements</li><li>\u27a4 body absorbs</li><li>\u27a4 10-20%</li><li>\u27a4 elemental iron</li><li>\u27a4 supplements</li><li>\u27a4 dose of 200-300 mg,</li><li>\u27a4 20-60</li><li>\u27a4 mg</li><li>\u27a4 absorbed</li><li>\u27a4 hemoglobin levels improve,</li><li>\u27a4 efficiency of iron absorption decreases</li><li>\u27a4 natural regulatory mechanisms</li><li>\u27a4 prevent iron overload.</li><li>\u27a4 increase in reticulocyte count</li><li>\u27a4 within 2 weeks</li><li>\u27a4 peaking at 4 weeks.</li><li>\u27a4 iron</li><li>\u27a4 supplementation</li><li>\u27a4 continue for 3-6 months</li><li>\u27a4 hemoglobin normalization</li><li>\u27a4 complete replenishment</li><li>\u27a4 iron stores</li><li>\u27a4 prevent</li><li>\u27a4 recurrence of anemia,</li><li>\u27a4 stopping</li><li>\u27a4 immediately</li><li>\u27a4 after normalization</li><li>\u27a4 incorrect.</li><li>\u27a4 helps</li><li>\u27a4 effective management of iron deficiency</li><li>\u27a4 anemia</li><li>\u27a4 preventing its recurrence.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
