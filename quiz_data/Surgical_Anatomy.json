Dissection progresses through the subcutaneous fat and the clavipectoral fascia down to the lateral border of the pectoralis major. The axillary vein , nerves to serratus anterior, and thoracodorsal pedicle are identified and preserved . The intercostal brachial nerves are usually divided in this operation, and the patient should be warned about sensation changes postoperatively. The intercostobrachial nerve is the lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve and gives sensory supply to the axilla and medial aspect of the arm . The axillary nerve supplies the deltoid and teres minor muscles and the small patch of skin on the lateral aspect of the upper arm, called the \u2018regimental badge patch.\u2019 The long thoracic nerve of Bell arises from the C5\u2013C7 nerve roots and supplies the serratus anterior ; injury to this nerve would result in winging of the scapula .

OPTION C: Thoracodorsal nerve innervates the latissimus dorsi muscle.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The severity of symptoms depends on the extent of nerve damage and may range from mild numbness to chronic pain. In some cases, the intercostobrachial nerve may be intentionally cut or removed during surgery to prevent chronic pain or discomfort caused by the nerve. However, the loss of sensation in the inner arm and axilla can be distressing for some patients, and nerve-sparing techniques are sometimes used to preserve the nerve during breast surgery. Management of intercostobrachial nerve injury typically involves medications for pain relief and nerve regeneration therapy to promote healing and restore sensation.</p>\n<p></p>",

Lymphatic spread not only represents an evolutionary event in the spread of the carcinoma but also serves as a marker for the tumor's metastatic potential. The involvement of supraclavicular nodes and any contralateral lymph nodes indicates advanced disease.</p>\n<p></p>",
