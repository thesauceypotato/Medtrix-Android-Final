      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>ERCP Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography remains widely used as both a diagnostic and a therapeutic modality and provides excellent images of the ductal anatomy and can identify causes of obstruction such as calculi or malignant strictures. Therapeutic interventions such as stone removal or stent placement to relieve the block can be performed. Thus, ERCP has evolved into a mainly therapeutic rather than a diagnostic technique. Sphincterotomy is done at 11 o'clock when negotiating the scope inside the CBD</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Diagnosis of cholelithiasis : The first test is usually an abdominal ultrasound (USG) , which can detect gallstones in the gallbladder and also estimate the diameter of the common bile duct (CBD). A dilated CBD ( >8 mm in diameter ) in a patient with gallstones, jaundice, and biliary pain highly suggests choledocholithiasis . Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a noninvasive imaging test that provides excellent anatomical detail and has a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 98%, respectively, for detecting CBD stones. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a diagnostic and therapeutic test of choice for patients suspected of having gallstones or CBD stones.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is a noninvasive modality that provides excellent gallbladder and biliary system imaging. Images of the biliary tree demonstrating ductal obstruction, strictures, or other intraductal abnormalities can be obtained. Option: C . MRCP is only an imaging modality. Option: D . None of the above is the correct option.</p>\n<p></p>",
