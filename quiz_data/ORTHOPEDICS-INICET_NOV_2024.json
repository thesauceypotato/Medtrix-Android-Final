      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Closed reduction internal fixation An intracapsular fracture of the femur involves a fracture that occurs within the joint capsule, typically at the femoral neck. In a 40-year-old patient with such a fracture, the surgery of choice depends on the fracture pattern, health status, and functional demands.so most suitable ans is Closed reduction internal fixation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Closed Reduction Internal Fixation (CRIF) is often preferred for young and active individuals with a non-displaced or minimally displaced femoral neck fracture because it allows for: Preservation of the femoral head, reducing the risk of avascular necrosis (AVN), which is a risk with more invasive procedures. Early mobilization and functional recovery. The procedure involves manipulating the fracture into proper alignment without opening the fracture site (closed reduction) and stabilizing it using internal fixation devices like screws or a plate.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF): ORIF involves a surgical approach to open the fracture site, realign the bones (reduction), and secure them with internal fixation devices (e.g., plates, screws). Option: C. Hemiarthroplasty: A hemiarthroplasty involves replacing the femoral head with a prosthetic implant, leaving the acetabulum intact. It is typically indicated for elderly patients or those with severe displacement or fractures that are unlikely to heal properly with fixation, or when there is a risk of AVN. Option: D. Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA): A total hip arthroplasty involves replacing both the femoral head and the acetabulum with artificial components. It is a more extensive procedure compared to hemiarthroplasty.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Gluteus Medius During walking, when one leg is lifted (the suspended leg), the hip bone on the side of the suspended leg is raised or stabilized by the action of the Gluteus Medius muscle on the supporting leg. The Gluteus Medius is located on the outer surface of the pelvis, and its primary function is to abduct the thigh and stabilize the pelvis during walking. Specifically, it helps to prevent the pelvic drop on the side of the suspended leg (the unsupported side). If the gluteus medius is weak or non-functional, the pelvis on the unsupported side will sag, a condition known as a Trendelenburg sign.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Functional Roles of Gluteal Muscles Gluteus Maximus : Primary Function : Powerful hip extension during activities like standing up, climbing stairs, running, and jumping. Stabilization : Supports the pelvis during upright posture. Gluteus Medius : Primary Function : Stabilizes the pelvis during single-leg stance (walking, running). Prevents Pelvic Drop : Keeps the pelvis level when the opposite leg is off the ground. Gluteus Minimus : Primary Function : Assists in hip abduction and internal rotation for maintaining balance during walking and other dynamic movements. Pelvic Stability : Works with gluteus medius to stabilize the hip joint.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Gluteus Maximus: The Gluteus Maximus is the largest muscle in the buttock, and it plays a key role in the extension and external rotation of the hip joint. It is also involved in maintaining an upright posture and providing stability during activities such as climbing stairs or running. Function in Walking: While the gluteus maximus provides stability during walking, especially in late stance phase (as the foot is on the ground), it is not responsible for raising the hip bone on the side of the suspended leg. Its primary role is in hip extension and posterior pelvic tilt. Option: C. Obturator Internus: The Obturator Internus is a muscle that originates from the inner surface of the pelvis and inserts into the greater trochanter of the femur. It is involved in lateral rotation and abduction of the hip when the hip is flexed. Function in Walking: While the obturator internus helps in lateral rotation of the hip, it does not play a major role in stabilizing the pelvis during walking or lifting the hip bone of the suspended leg. Its function is more associated with hip movement rather than stabilization during walking. Option: D. Quadratus Femoris: The Quadratus Femoris is a small muscle located at the back of the hip joint. It plays a role in lateral rotation of the thigh and stabilizes the hip joint. Function in Walking: The quadratus femoris does not directly assist in raising the hip bone on the side of the suspended leg during walking. Its primary function is to laterally rotate the hip and stabilize the hip joint.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Movement Target Target motion direction Prime mover Insertion Insertion Medial compartment of thigh Moves back of lower legs up to- ward buttocks, as when kneeling; assists in opening thighs Femur; tibia/ fibula Tibia/fibula: flexion; thigh: adduction Gracilis Inferior ramus; body of pubis; ischial ramus Medial surface of tibia Anterior compartment of thigh: Quadriceps femoris group Moves back of lower legs up to-ward buttocks, as when kneeling: assists in opening thighs Femur, tibia/ fibula Tibia/fibula: flexion; thigh: adduction Gracilis Inferior ramus; body of pubis; ischial ramus Medial surface of tibia Moves lower leg out in front of body, as when kicking Tibia/fibula Extension Vastus medialis Linea aspera; inter- trochanteric line Patella; tibial tuberosity Moves lower leg out in front of body, as when kicking; assists in raising the knee Tibia/fibula Tibia/fibula: extension; thigh: flexion Rectus femoris Anterior inferior iliac spine; superior margin of acetabulum Patella; tibial tuberosity Moves lower leg out in front of body, as when kicking Tibia/fibula Extension Vastus lateralis Greater trochanter; intertrochanteric line; linea aspera Patella; tibial tuberosity Moves back of lower legs up and back toward the buttocks, as when kneeling; assists in moving thigh diagonally upward and outward as when mounting a bike Femur; tibia/ fibula Extension Vastus medialis Linea aspera; intertrochanteric line Patella; tibial tuberosity Posterior compartment of thigh: Hamstring group Moves back of lower legs up and back toward the buttocks, as when kneeling: moves thigh down and back; twists the thigh (and lower leg) outward Femur; tibia/ fibula Tibia/fibula: flexion; thigh: extension, lateral rotation Biceps femoris Ischial tuberosity: linea aspera; distal femur Head of fibula; lateral condyle of tibia Moves back of lower legs up toward buttocks, as when kneeling; moves thigh down and back; twists the thigh (and lower leg) inward Femur; tibia/ fibula Tibia/fibula: flexion; thigh: extension, medial rotation Semitendinosus Ischial tuberosity Upper tibial shaft Moves back of lower legs up and back toward the buttocks as when kneeling: moves thigh down and back; twists the thigh (and lower leg) inward Femur; tibia/ fibula Tibia/fibula: flexion; thigh: extension, medial rotation Semi membranous Ischial tuberosity Medial condyle of tibia; lateral condyle of femur</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Loss of extension of digits The posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) is a branch of the radial nerve that innervates the extensor muscles of the forearm, which control the extension of the fingers and thumb. Loss of extension of digits: PIN injury results in the inability to extend the digits (fingers) because it innervates the extensor digitorum, extensor indicis, and extensor digiti minimi.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Posterior Interosseous Nerve (PIN) Origin: The PIN is a branch of the radial nerve that arises in the forearm after passing through the supinator muscle. Course: It travels through the supinator muscle and continues along the posterior interosseous membrane, accompanied by the posterior interosseous artery. Innervation: The PIN provides motor innervation to the extensor muscles of the forearm (except the brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus, and anconeus): Extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) Extensor digitorum (ED) Extensor digiti minimi (EDM) Extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) Supinator Abductor pollicis longus (APL) Extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) Extensor pollicis longus (EPL) Extensor indicis (EI) Clinical Significance: Posterior interosseous nerve syndrome (Radial Tunnel Syndrome) : Characterized by weakness or paralysis of the PIN-innervated extensor muscles. Unlike radial nerve injuries, there is no sensory loss . Patients struggle to extend the fingers and wrist.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Loss of extension of wrist: Incorrect. While the PIN innervates some wrist extensors (e.g., extensor carpi ulnaris), the primary wrist extensors (extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis) are innervated by the radial nerve before it branches into the PIN. Therefore, wrist extension is preserved. Option: C. Loss of supination: Incorrect. Supination is primarily performed by the biceps brachii (musculocutaneous nerve) and partially by the supinator muscle, which is innervated by the radial nerve but usually not affected significantly in PIN injuries. Option: D. Wrist drop: Incorrect. Wrist drop occurs with proximal radial nerve injury, not isolated PIN injury, because the proximal radial nerve also supplies the primary wrist extensors (extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis). In PIN injury, wrist extension is intact, though weak or altered in direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA PIN topography:</p>\n<p></p>",
