The afferent paths of the bulbocavernosus reflex are the sensory fibers of the pudendal nerves and the reflex center in the S2\u2013S4 spinal segment. The efferent paths are the motor fibers of the pudendal nerves and anal sphincter muscles.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The bulbocavernosus reflex (BCR) is clinically elicited by squeezing the glans penis and digitally palpating the contraction of the bulbocavernosus (BC) muscle. The test involves monitoring internal and external sphincter contraction in response to squeezing the glans penis or clitoris, or tugging on an indwelling Foley catheter. This reflex can also be tested electrophysiologically by stimulating the penis or vulva and recording from the anal sphincter.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A: The Achilles reflex or ankle jerk reflex, mediated by S1 through the sciatic (tibial) nerve and elicited by tapping the tendon of the gastrocnemius muscle OPTION B: The plantar reflex is a nociceptive segmental spinal reflex that serves the purpose of protecting the sole of the foot. The clinical significance lies in the fact that the abnormal response reliably indicates metabolic or structural abnormality in the corticospinal system upstream from the segmental reflex. OPTION C: Cremasteric reflex: This reflex is elicited by stroking the ipsilateral thigh which leads to reflex elevation of the ipsilateral testicle by greater than 0.5cm.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA # BULBOCAVERNOSUS REFLEX Cord transection: In this type, the cord and its surrounding tissues are transected. The injury is anatomical and irreparable. Initially, the motor paralysis is flaccid because the cord below the level of injury is in a state of 'spinal shock'. After some time, however, the cord recovers from shock and acts as an independent structure, without any control from the higher centres. In this state, though the cord manifests reflex activity at spinal level, there is no voluntary control over body parts below the level of injury. There is total loss of sensation and autonomic functions below the level of injury. The appearance of signs suggestive of reflex cord activity i.e., bulbo-cavernosus reflex, anal reflex and plantar reflex, without recovery of motor power or sensations is an indicator of cord transection. These reflexes usually appear within 24 hours of the injury. In a few days or weeks, the flaccid paralysis (due to spinal shock) becomes spastic, with exaggerated tendon reflexes and clonus. Involuntary flexor spasms at different joints and spasticity leads to contractures. Sensation and autonomic functions never return.</p>\n<p></p>",
