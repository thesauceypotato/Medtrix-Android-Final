      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>10th The costodiaphragmatic recess , also called the Costophrenic break, is the posterolateral fringe of the pleural space, a potential length around the lung inside the pleural cavity. It is located at the acutely angled junction (\"reflection\") between the costal and diaphragmatic parietal pleura and is interpreted two-dimensionally on plain X-rays as the costophrenic angle . It measures approximately 5 cm (2.0 in) vertically and extends from the eighth to the tenth rib along the mid-axillary line.

Option D: 12th rib The costovertebral angle (CVA) is located on your back at the bottom of your ribcage at the 12th rib. It's the 90-degree angle formed between the curve of that rib and your spine.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Pleural effusion fluid often builds up in the costophrenic angle (due to gravity). This can push the lung upwards, resulting in \"blunting\" of the costophrenic angle. The posterior angle is the deepest. Obtuse angulation is a sign of disease. A chest X-ray is the first test to confirm the pleural fluid's presence. The lateral upright chest X-ray should be examined when a pleural effusion is suspected. In an upright X-ray, 75 mL of fluid blunts the posterior costophrenic angle. Blunting the lateral costophrenic angle usually requires about 175 mL but may take as much as 500 mL. More significant pleural effusions opacify portions of the hemithorax and may cause a mediastinal shift; flows> 4 L may cause complete opacification of the hemithorax and mediastinal shift to the contralateral side.</p>\n<p></p>",

The visceral pleura is firmly attached to the surface of the lung, including both opposed surfaces of the fissures that divide the lungs into lobes. The lower border of each visceral pleura lies two ribs higher than the parietal pleural reflection. Reflection of Parietal Pleura Inferiorly, the costal pleura reflects onto the diaphragm above the costal margin. The pleural cavity extends inferiorly to approximately rib VIII in the midclavicular line. So the correct answer is Option C. In the midaxillary line, it extends to rib X. From this point, the inferior margin courses somewhat horizontally, crossing ribs XI and XII to reach vertebra TXII.

Right oblique fissure The superior part of the right oblique fissure separates the right upper lobe from the right lower lobe and the inferior part separates the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe.
