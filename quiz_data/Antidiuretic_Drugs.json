Other adverse effects include hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperuricemia. The inhibition of renal Na+-Cl- cotransporters in the early distal tubule causes a net urine loss of positive ions such as sodium. This is compensated by increased renal tubular reabsorption of calcium to maintain electrochemical balance.

Thiazide and most other diuretics decrease serum sodium concentration by increasing the loss of sodium in the urine. The diuretic effect of thiazides is due to the decreased reabsorption of renal Na+, which creates an osmotic gradient for fluid to be excreted in the urine. Option: C. Thiazides and most other diuretics (except potassium-sparing agents) increase potassium excretion in the urine due to the increased exchange of potassium for sodium via the Na+-K+ cotransporter in the late distal tubule. To avoid hypokalemia, thiazide diuretics may be combined with potassium-sparing diuretics. Option: D.
