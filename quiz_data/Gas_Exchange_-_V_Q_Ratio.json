      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>V/Q ratio When a person is upright, blood flow is higher at the base of the lung due to the effect of gravity. Ventilation, or the amount of air that reaches the alveoli, is also higher at the base of the lung due to increased compliance and decreased resistance in the lower airways.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The alveoli at the apex of the lung are larger than those at the base, so their compliance is less. Because the compliance is reduced, less inspired gas goes to the apex than to the base. Also, because the apex is above the heart, less blood flows through the apex than through the base. However, the reduction in airflow is less than the reduction in blood flow, so the V \u02d9/Q \u02d9 ratio at the top of the lung is greater than it is at the bottom. The increased V \u02d9/Q \u02d9 ratio at the apex makes PaCO2 lower and PaO2 higher at the apex than they are at the base. Ventilation is highest at the base of the lung due to the higher alveolar compliance there. But the V/Q ratio is higher at the apex (ventilation is lower at the apex and higher at the base but the regional difference isn't as huge for ventilation as it is for perfusion), so the gas exchange is more efficient at the apex, and results in the highest PO2 in the lung (and lower PCO2) when compared to the base. The reason for this is that at the start of inspiration, intrapleural pressure is less negative at the base than at the apex, and since the intrapulmonary intrapleural pressure difference is less than at the apex, the lung is less expanded.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The V/Q ratio is higher at the apex of the lung compared to the base when a person is upright. This is because ventilation is relatively greater at the apex compared to blood flow. In congestive heart failure, there is impaired blood flow due to the weakened heart, and this can lead to ventilation-perfusion mismatch, with decreased V/Q ratio. By performing pulmonary function testing in both supine and upright positions, the effect of gravity on lung function can be assessed.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Ventilation/perfusion mismatch Ideally, ventilation (V) is matched to perfusion (Q) per minute (ie,\n  dot V / dot Oratio = 1 ) for adequate gas exchange.
