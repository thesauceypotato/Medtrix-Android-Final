The danger area of the face is located in the triangular region from the lateral angle of the eye to the middle of the upper lip, near the nose, and is drained by the facial vein. The facial vein communicates directly with the cavernous sinus through the superior ophthalmic vein.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. The pterygoid venous plexus communicates with the cavernous sinus through the inferior ophthalmic vein, but it is not directly connected to the cavernous sims. Option: C. The parietal emissary veins and frontal venous plexus do not communicate directly with the cavernous sinus. Option: D. The basilar venous plexus connects the inferior petrosal sinuses and communicates with the internal vertebral venous plexus.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The internal jugular bulb The sigmoid sinus collects venous blood from the transverse sinuses and empties it into a small cavity known as the jugular bulb, the inferior portion of which is located beneath the bony floor of the middle ear cavity. A paraganglioma is a tumor that may originate from paraganglia cells found in the middle ear and on the jugular bulb. Tumors that originate from the jugular bulb can grow to fill the entire bulb and may effectively block blood returning to the heart from that side of the brain. Blood flow from the brain is gradually diverted toward the opposite sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb, causing the opposite venous system to expand and accommodate increased blood flow.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. The cochlea and lateral semicircular canals are located in the inner ear and are not directly affected by such a tumor. Option: B. The internal carotid artery is related to the anterior wall of the middle ear cavity and is not likely to be affected by a tumor penetrating the middle ear. Option: C. The sigmoid venous sinus collects venous blood beneath the temporal bone and follows a tortuous (S-shaped) course to the jugular foramen, where it becomes continuous with the internal jugular vein at the jugular bulb.</p>\n<p></p>",
