      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Loss of sensation of tip of index finger dorsal side The structure marked in the Image is the median nerve in the cubital fossa. A lesion of the median nerve causes loss of sensation of the nail of the index finger as it supplies Lateral 2/3rd of palm by superficial cutaneous branch & Lateral 3 \u00bd fingers (palmar aspect and dorsal aspect of nail beds) by palmar digital nerves. The median nerve continues in the cubital fossa medial to the brachial artery and passes between the two heads of the pronator teres, deep to the bicipital aponeurosis (aponeurosis of biceps) and superficial the brachialis muscle. It crosses the ulnar artery (branch of brachial artery) while being separated by the deep head of the pronator teres. Median Nerve cutaneous innervation It then travels between the flexor digitorum superficialis (above) and flexor digitorum profundus (below). The median nerve is accompanied by the median artery (a branch of anterior interosseous artery) during this course. Then, about 5 cm above the flexor retinaculum (wrist), it emerges between the flexor digitorum superficialis (medially) and the flexor carpi radialis (laterally) into the hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The main trunk of the median nerve innervates the superficial and deep groups of the muscles in the anterior compartment of the forearm with the exception of flexor carpi ulnaris. The median nerve does this by giving off two branches as it courses through the forearm: Muscular branches are given off in the cubital fossa to supply flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, and flexor digitorum superficialis. The anterior interosseous branch is given off in the upper part of the forearm, courses with the anterior interosseous artery and innervates flexor pollicis longus and the lateral half of flexor digitorum profundus (the ulnar half is supplied by ulnar nerve, as is the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle). It ends with its innervation of pronator quadratus. In addition to its supply to muscles, this nerve also supplies the distal radioulnar joint and wrist joint.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The median nerve also gives off sensory and other branches in the forearm. The palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve arises at the distal part of the forearm. It supplies sensory innervation to the thenar eminence of the palm and the central palm. Articular branches are given to the elbow joint and proximal radioulnar joint. Vascular branches supply the radial and ulnar arteries. Meanwhile, a communicating branch is given to the ulnar nerve. The median nerve enters the hand through the carpal tunnel, deep to the flexor retinaculum along with the tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor digitorum profundus, and flexor pollicis longus. From there, it is divided into recurrent muscular branch and digital cutaneous branch: The muscular branch (also known as recurrent branch) supplies the thenar muscles (opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis, and superficial part of flexor pollicis brevis) Digital cutaneous branches to the proper palmar digital branch and the common palmar digital branch: The proper palmar digital branch gives out three digital branches to the lateral one and a half digits (two digital branches to the thumb, one digital branch to the lateral side of the index finger). The digital branch to the index finger also supplies the first lumbrical. The common palmar digital branch divides further into two branches. Both the medial and lateral branches supply the second and third interdigital clefts with adjoining index, middle, and lateral half of the ring finger. The lateral branch also supplies the second lumbrical.</p>\n<p></p>",

Ganglion cell layer \u2013 Contains nuclei of ganglion cells, the axons of which become the optic nerve fibres, and some displaced amacrine cells.

Outer plexiform layer \u2013 P rojections of rods and cones ending in the rod spherule and cone pedicle, respectively. These make synapses with dendrites of bipolar cells and horizontal cells.
