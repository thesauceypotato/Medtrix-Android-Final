It is dignosed by CT angiography . A barium swallow shows fixed narrowing of the esophagus at the level of aortic arch without mucosal abnormality. Treatment is surgical repair either by reconstruction or ligation of the aberrant right subclavian artery. Aberrant left subclavian artery is very rare anomaly and does not occur in this condition. Aberrant left vertebral artery originates fromn arch distal to left subclavian artery with segmental regression of the dorsal aorta between the 6th & 7th intersegmental arteries. It runs through the spinal coloumn in the neck & provides blood to the brain and spine. Aberrant innominate artery is a very rare occurence. Although asymptomatic, it can be fatal in any surgery involving the neck & thorax, particularly in a percutaneous tracheostomy. Also known as brachiocephalic artery and usually takes its origin to the left of the trachea & subsequently compresses trachea.</p>\n<p></p>",

According to guidelines, no foreign body should be left in the esophagus for >24hours. Endoscopic removal under anesthesia is the standard of therapy. In x-ray findings:- if foreign body is present in the esophagus, it appears as a slit-like object. If foreign body is present in the trachea, it appears like a round object on seeing.</p>\n<p></p>",
