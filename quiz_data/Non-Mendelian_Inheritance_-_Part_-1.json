      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Epigenetics</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Epigenetics: Epigenetics is the study of heritable chemical modification of DNA or chromatin that does NOT alter the DNA sequence itself . Examples of such modification include the methylation of DNA and the methylation and acetylation of histones . Epigenetic modifications are critical for normal human development , including the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression , X chromosome inactivation , and imprinting , as well as for understanding the cellular perturbations in aging and cancer. Gene expression frequently correlates negatively with the level of methylation of DNA . Methylation analysis is also essential in diagnosing Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome.

In a translocation, a segment of one chromosome is transferred to another, e.g., BCR-ABL translocation 9;22 is seen in CML. Option: B. Inversion. It occurs when a segment breaks off and reattaches within the same chromosome but in reverse orientation. Option: C. Mutation. Permanent changes in DNA.</p>\n<p></p>",

Karyotype from a normal male is shown below: Human somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes; these comprise 22 homologous pairs of autosomes and two sex chromosomes, XX in the female and XY in the male. The usual procedure to examine chromosomes is to arrest dividing cells in metaphase with mitotic spindle inhibitors (e.g., N-diacetyl-N-methylcolchicine [Colcemid]) and then to stain the chromosomes. In a metaphase spread, the individual chromosomes form two chromatids connected at the centromere. A karyotype is obtained by arranging each pair of autosomes according to length, followed by sex chromosomes . Various staining methods have been developed to identify individual chromosomes based on a distinctive and reliable pattern of alternating light and dark bands. The one most commonly used involves a Giemsa stain and is hence called G banding . Standard G banding can detect approximately 400 to 800 bands per haploid set.

Note that all progeny of an affected male (shaded squares) are normal , but all children, male and female, of the affected female (shaded circles) manifest disease to a variable degree . Most genes are located on chromosomes in the cell nucleus and are inherited in a classic Mendelian fashion. Several mitochondrial genes exist, however, that are inherited in quite a different manner. A feature unique to mtDNA is maternal inheritance . This peculiarity exists because ova contain numerous mitochondria within their abundant cytoplasm, whereas spermatozoa contain few, if any .

The majority of trinucleotide expansion disorders share certain common features. Some individuals display premutation , a characteristic in which the copy number of the trinucleotide is increased and unstable, but their phenotype is normal . Individuals with premutations may pass on further expanded trinucleotide tracts to their offspring, evident in the patient's ages, father, and grandfather when they developed the clinical symptoms. In Huntington's disease, there are CAG repeats which in normal individuals is 6 to 35 copies of the repeat; when the number of repetitions is increased beyond this level, it is associated with the disease.
