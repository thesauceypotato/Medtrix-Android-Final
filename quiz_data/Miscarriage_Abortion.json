      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>< 20 weeks Fetal death means death before complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a product of human conception irrespective of the duration of pregnancy and which is not an induced termination of pregnancy. The death is indicated by the fact that after such expulsion or extraction, the fetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life, such as the beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles. Fetal mortality is divided into three periods: Early, or < 20 completed weeks; intermediate, 20\u201327 weeks; and late, 28 weeks or more. The fetal death rate after 28 weeks has declined since 1990, whereas deaths from 20 to 27 weeks remain unchanged.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Early fetal demise: Those early pregnancy losses in which fetal development is observed by ultrasound and fetal tissue is found on the histologic examination.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Blighted ova: Those early pregnancy losses in which fetal development is not observed with ultrasound (so that only a gestational sac is present with or without a yolk sac) and fetal tissue is absent on histologic examination of the products of conception. The difference between these two types of abortion is of fundamental importance. The lack of development of fetal structures defines a subset of abortions of genetic origin. In contrast, the early interruption of fetal life is a complex phenomenon with multiple etiologies. Therefore, the patients with blighted ova do not require extensive workup, whereas patients who have aborted cytogenetically normal fetuses need an extensive search for nongenetic factors responsible for the pregnancy loss</p>\n<p></p>",
