      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Both a & b 20,000 genes in humans give rise to a total of 2.5 lakh proteins . Which cannot be explained by this theory. This can be explained because there are processes such as RNA editing: Apo B48 & Apo B100 are synthesized from the same mRNA due to differences in RNA Editing/Chemical modification of RNA/ Differential RNA Processing In the liver , apo B mRNA is 100% translated to produce apoB100 In the intestine, the same apo B mRNA is acted upon by the cytosine deaminase enzyme which converts one of the cytosine bases (in the mRNA) to uracil converting the codon CAA to UAA (stop codon). Later during translation of this mRNA protein synthesis gets prematurely terminated with the final protein missing some of the amino acids of apo B100 protein. This short version of the protein is apoB48. Which lacks the hepatic receptor-binding domain (missing amino acids). It has different properties than apoB100. Alternate splicing: Multiple RNA forms can be generated from the same gene transcript by alternate splicing which gives rise to different proteins.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1, 2, and 5 are correct Mutation in the mitochondrial genome mainly affects oxidative phosphorylation leading to low ATP and anaerobic glycolysis with lactic acid accumulation, especially under stressful conditions such as exercise due to depletion of blood oxygen saturation. A vicious cycle of exercise intolerance leading to muscle inactivity with fewer mitochondria exacerbates myopathy (muscle weakness and incoordination) in mitochondrial disorders. All the reactions of the citric acid cycle and some of the initial reactions of the urea cycle are located primarily in the mitochondria, whereas glycogen and glucose metabolism pathways primarily occur in the cytosol (Options A and D are excluded). \u03b1-keto glutarate and fumarate are intermediates of the citric acid cycle, but only fumarate is an intermediate of both the citric acid and urea cycles (Option B is excluded). Fumarate and arginine are produced from argininosuccinate in the urea cycle, after which arginine is converted to ornithine to yield urea (option E is excluded) and fumarate is converted to malate and then oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle.</p>\n<p></p>",
