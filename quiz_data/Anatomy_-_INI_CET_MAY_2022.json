Seen in parotid gland, salivary gland Apocrine gland : Mammary gland (modified sweat gland) secretory products are released at the apical cell surface in small membrane bound vesicles that enter into a duct (e.g. secretion of lipid droplets in the mammary gland). There is apical loss of cell membrane Axilla, perineum, ceruminous gland Note the lipid droplets and protein-rich secretions within the lumens in the image Holocrine : Sebaceous gland in skin Entire cell membrane is lost, cells are broken and organelles become contents of secretion like sebum and goes along hair follicle Lipids are extracted during tissue processing, resulting in pale staining within the secretory cells.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - Sebaceous gland - The sebaceous gland contributes the vast majority of skin surface lipids via its main product, sebum, which helps to seal in moisture and prevent desiccation of the skin. Because sebaceous glands empty into the hair canal, sebum mostly escapes onto the skin surface via a wicking action involving the hair shaft Option C - Hair follicle - A hair follicle anchors each hair into the skin. The hair bulb forms the base of the hair follicle. In the hair bulb, living cells divide and grow to build the hair shaft. Blood vessels nourish the cells in the hair bulb, and deliver hormones that modify hair growth and structure at different times of life. Option D - adipose tissue - The adipose tissue is a central metabolic organ in the regulation of whole-body energy homeostasis. The white adipose tissue functions as a key energy reservoir for other organs, whereas the brown adipose tissue accumulates lipids for cold-induced adaptive thermogenesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Endocrine glands Endocrine glands are specialized for production and secretion of proteins and hormones. They are typically organized as clusters or cords of secretory epithelial cells and differ from exocrine glands in two major ways: Lack a system of ducts Secretory products are released into the extracellular space where they act on nearby target cells or enter into the blood vasculature to travel to their target organs.</p>\n<p></p>",

The epithelium of the tubule consists of a type of sustentacular cells known as Sertoli cells, which are tall, columnar type cells that line the tubule. In between the Sertoli cells are spermatogenic cells, which differentiate through meiosis to sperm cells. Sertoli cells function to nourish the developing sperm cells. They secrete androgen-binding protein, a binding protein which increases the concentration of testosterone inside the seminiferous tubules. Embryologically, they also secrete the anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) necessary for the female M\u00fcllerian ducts to regress. There are two types: convoluted and straight, convoluted toward the lateral side, and straight as the tubule comes medially to form ducts that will exit the testis. The seminiferous tubules are formed from the testis cords that develop from the primitive gonadal cords, formed from the gonadal ridge. Spermatogenesis, the process for producing spermatozoa, takes place in the seminiferous tubules. During spermatogenesis, the DNA of spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules is subject to damage from such sources as reactive oxygen species. The genomic integrity of spermatogenic cells is protected by DNA repair processes. Deficiencies in the enzymes employed in these repair processes may lead to infertility The lumen side - matured spermatozoa are released in lumen The basal side - spermatogonium is present which is covered by muscle layer.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - spermatozoa is present at most luminal side and not just after myofibril.

Option B - Posterior cerebral artery - The PCA courses from the basilar artery towards the occiput around the cerebral peduncle and over the tentorium cerebelli to ultimately supply the occipital lobe, posteromedial temporal lobes, midbrain, thalamus, choroid plexus, and part of the lateral and third ventricles.

The posterior pericallosal (splenial) artery usually is a branch of the posterior cerebral artery but its origin is variable . It bifurcates into an inferior and a superior branch, which supply the inferior and superior part of the splenium, respectively. The superior branch usually anastomoses with the pericallosal artery. In the majority of patients, the corpus callosum also gets blood supply from the anterior communicating artery via either the median callosal or the subcallosal artery. The subcallosal artery supplies the hypothalamus in part, but also supplies the rostrum and genu of the corpus callosum. The median callosal artery is very similar to the subcallosal artery, but it runs further in order to reach the body of the corpus callosum .</p>\n<p></p>",

It is defined by the S-shaped joint complex of the talocalcaneonavicular joint (referred to as the talonavicular joint in the rest of this article) and calcaneocuboid joint and their supporting ligaments. The talonavicular joint is stabilized by the dorsal talonavicular ligament and the calcaneonavicular component of the bifurcate ligament. The calcaneocuboid joint is stabilized by the dorsal calcaneocuboid ligament, short and long plantar ligaments, and calcaneocuboid component of the bifurcate ligament. The spring ligament supports both joints, crossing from the calcaneus to the navicular. Option C - Deltoid ligament 4 parts : Anterior tibiotalar Posterior tibiotalar Tibiocalcaneal Tibionavicular Deltoid ligament is usually fused with spring ligament</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The Lisfranc ligament refers to the most important ligament of the Lisfranc joint ligamentous complex. It is one of the most commonly disrupted ligaments in midfoot injuries.</p>\n<p></p>",
