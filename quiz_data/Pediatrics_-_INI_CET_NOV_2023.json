      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>i and iv Cystic fibrosis is a genetic multisystem disease, due to CFTR gene mutation, resulting in inactivation of CFTR chloride channel. There is exocrine & endocrine pancreatic insufficiency. As CFTR protein helps in CL - reabsorption from the sweat, its dysfunction results in increased salt and water secretion as sweat.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Cystic fibrosis Genetics - Autosomal recessive; defect in CFTR gene on chromosome 7; commonly a deletion of Phe508. Pathophysiology - CFTR encodes an ATP-gated Cl\u2212 channel that secretes Cl\u2212 in lungs and GI tract, and reabsorbs Cl\u2212 in sweat glands. Phe508 deletion causes misfolded protein causing improper protein trafficking and protein retention in RER, protein absent from cell membrane, decreased Cl\u2212 (and H2O) secretion; increased intracellular Cl\u2212 results in compensatory, increased Na+ reabsorption via epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC), increased H2O reabsorption causing abnormally thick mucus secreted into lungs and GI tract. Increased Na+ reabsorption also causes more negative transepithelial potential difference. Diagnosis - Increased Cl\u2212 concentration in pilocarpine-induced sweat test is diagnostic. Can present with contraction alkalosis and hypokalemia (ECF effects analogous to a patient taking a loop diuretic) because of ECF H2O/Na+ losses via sweating and concomitant renal K+/H+ wasting. Increased immunoreactive trypsinogen (newborn screening) due to clogging of pancreatic duct. Complications: Recurrent pulmonary infections (eg, S aureus [infancy and early childhood], P aeruginosa [adulthood], allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [ABPA]), chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis causing reticulonodular pattern on CXR, opacification of sinuses. Nasal polyps, nail clubbing. Pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorption with steatorrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E, K) progressing to endocrine dysfunction (CF-related diabetes), biliary cirrhosis, liver disease. Meconium ileus in newborns. Infertility in males (absence of vas deferens, spermatogenesis may be unaffected) and subfertility in females (amenorrhea, abnormally thick cervical mucus). Treatment - Multifactorial: chest physiotherapy, albuterol, aerosolized dornase alfa (DNase), and inhaled hypertonic saline facilitate mucus clearance. Azithromycin used as anti-inflammatory agent. Ibuprofen slows disease progression. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (pancrelipase) for pancreatic insufficiency. Combination of lumacaftor or tezacaftor (each corrects misfolded proteins and improves their transport to cell surface) with ivacaftor. (opens Cl\u2013 channels causes improved chloride transport).</p>\n<p></p>",

This hole allows organs in the abdomen, such as the stomach, intestines, and liver, to move into the thorax. In congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), the herniation of abdominal contents into the chest cavity most commonly occurs through the foramen of Bochdalek. Hence, CDH is sometimes called Bochdalek's hernia. It is located on the left side of the diaphragm posteriorly. The following common site of herniation is through the foramen of Morgagni, which is anteriorly on the right side.

Symptoms of birth asphyxia may not be obvious, but the most common symptoms include: Before birth:- abnormal fetal heart rate and low pH levels. At birth:- poor skin color, low heart rate, weak muscle tone, gasping or weak breathing, and meconium stained amniotic fluid.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hydroxyurea Hydroxyurea increases the level of HbF, decreases the episodes of crisis & transfusion requirement.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disease that results from the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at position 6 of the beta-globin gene. Patients who are homozygous for the HbS gene have sickle cell disease. Types of Crisis: Vaso-occlusive crisis occurs when the microcirculation is obstructed by sickled red blood cells resulting in ischemic injury . The major complaint is pain, usually affecting bones such as femur, tibia and lower vertebrae. Acute chest syndrome . vaso-occlusive crisis that affects the lung and presents with chest pain, cough, tachypnea, dyspnea, hypoxemia, fever or a new pulmonary infiltrate. Sequestration crisis . This is due to sickled cells that block splenic outflow , leading to the pooling of peripheral blood in the engorged spleen resulting in splenic sequestration . Aplastic crisis . occur when the bone marrow stops producing red blood cells. Hydroxyurea, a myelosuppressive agent, is the only effective drug proven to reduce the frequency of painful episodes . It raises the level of HbF and the hemoglobin level. It usually decreases the rate of painful episodes by 50 % .</p>\n<p></p>",

Rubella or German measles has an intrauterine transmission that causes serious infection in pregnancy which results in abortions or severe fetal defects if infection occurs in the first trimester. The classical triad of congenital rubella syndrome is deafness, cataract, and congenital heart disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Herpes simplex infection can be acquired in utero, intrapartum/perinatally, or during the neonatal period. The intrauterine infection causes skin vesicles, eye findings (chorioretinitis, keratoconjunctivitis), and microcephaly/hydra Intrapartum infection presents with either: Skin, eye, and mouth disease Encephalitis Disseminated disease with sepsis-like presentation Option: B. Cytomegalovirus, the most common congenital infection with perinatal transmission presents with hepatosplenomegaly, petechial rashes, jaundice and microcephaly. One of the long-term sequelae is hearing loss. Option: D. Hepatitis B virus is associated with significant perinatal transmission. The most important risk factor that determines perinatal transmission is HBeAg.</p>\n<p></p>",
