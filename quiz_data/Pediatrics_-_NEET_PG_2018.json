      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>When baby is being fed milk Idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is the most common surgical disorder of the gastrointestinal tract in infants. The pylorus is thickened and elongated with narrowing of its lumen due to hypertrophy of the circular muscle fibers of pylorus. Clinical presentation The classical presentation is with non bilious vomiting that gradually increases in frequency and severity to become projectile in nature. The disorder is 4\u20136 times more common in boys than girls. Most patients present with vomiting starting beyond 3 weeks of age; however, about 20% are symptomatic since birth and presentation is delayed until 5 months of age in others. Constipation is common. Recurrent and persistent vomiting causes dehydration, malnutrition and hypochloremic alkalosis. As the stomach muscles contract forcibly to overcome the obstruction, a vigorous peristaltic wave can be seen to move from left hypochondrium to umbilicus, particularly on examination after feeding. A firm olive-shaped mass is palpable in the mid epigastrium in 75\u201380% infants, especially after feeds. Evaluation Ultrasound abdomen is the diagnostic investigation and shows  muscle thickness of > 4 mm and pylorus length of > 16 mm. The ultrasound is 100% sensitive and nearly 90% specific in diagnosis of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. However, in case of doubt, an upper GI barium study can show a consistent elongation of the pyloric channel or an upper GI endoscopy is performed. Differential diagnosis Gastroesophageal reflux disease Cow\u2019s milk protein allergy Antral or pyloric web are considered in patients without a palpable pyloric mass and normal ultrasound. Management The treatment includes rapid correction of dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. The treatment of choice is surgical; a pyloromyotomy (Ramstedt operation) is performed.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The abdominal mass associated with pyloric stenosis is typically best felt when the baby is being fed milk. The mass becomes more pronounced due to the increased peristaltic activity of the stomach during feeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A. Above umbilicus: The abdominal mass in pyloric stenosis is typically not felt above the umbilicus. Instead, it is usually located in the upper part of the abdomen, specifically in the right upper quadrant. OPTION C. From right to left upper quadrant: The abdominal mass in pyloric stenosis can be best felt by palpating from the right to the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. It is most prominent in the region where the enlarged pylorus, a muscular portion of the stomach, is located. OPTION D. When baby is sleeping: The abdominal mass in pyloric stenosis may not be as easily felt when the baby is sleeping. It is usually more prominent during feeding or immediately after feeding, as the increased muscle contractions in the stomach can make the mass more noticeable.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The abdominal mass in pyloric stenosis is described as an olive-shaped or olive-like mass. It is typically firm and located in the upper abdomen, just to the right of the midline. Visible peristalsis : In addition to feeling the abdominal mass, it may also be possible to observe visible peristaltic waves passing from left to right across the baby's abdomen after feeding.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>4 weeks Principles of Immunization While immunizing children, certain guidelines are useful in order  to maximize the benefit from vaccination. Important considerations during immunization are as follows: Compliance with the recommended dose and route of vaccination limits adverse events and loss of efficacy. A minimum interval of 4 weeks is recommended between the administrations of two live vaccines, if not administered simultaneously. Exceptions are\u2014OPV and MMR and OPV and oral typhoid (Ty21a), where administration of one before or after another is permitted if necessary. Killed antigens may be administered simultaneously or at any interval between the doses. However, a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses of DPT enhances immune responses. A gap of 3-4 weeks is recommended between two doses of cholera or yellow fever vaccine. There is no minimum recommended time interval between two types of vaccines. A live and an inactivated viral vaccine can be administered simultaneously at two different sites. A delay or lapse in the administration of a vaccine does not require the whole schedule to be repeated; the missed dose can be administered to resume the course at the point it was interrupted. Mixing of vaccines in the same syringe is not recommended, unless approved by the manufacturer. The following are not contraindications to immunization: Minor illnesses (e.g. upper respiratory tract infection and diarrhea, mild fever), prematurity, history of allergies, malnutrition, recent exposure to infection and current therapy with antibiotics. Live vaccines are contraindicated in children with inherited or acquired immunodeficiency and during therapy with immuno- suppressive drugs. Live viral vaccines may be given after short courses (less than 2 weeks) of low dose steroids. Immunoglobulins interfere with the immune response to certain live vaccines like measles or MMR. If immunoglobulins are administered within 14 days of the vaccine, vaccination should be repeated after 3\u20136 months. Immunoglobulins do not interfere with the immune response to OPV, yellow fever or oral typhoid vaccines. Hepatitis B, tetanus and rabies vaccine or toxoid may be administered concurrently with their corresponding immunoglobulin. Active immunization is recommended following exposure to rabies, measles, varicella, tetanus and hepatitis B.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The recommended time gap between two live vaccines is typically 4 weeks (or 28 days). This interval allows for an adequate immune response to each vaccine and minimizes the risk of potential interference between the two vaccines. By spacing them out, the immune system has sufficient time to respond to each vaccine individually and build a robust immune response. It's important to follow the specific recommendations provided by healthcare professionals and vaccination guidelines for the appropriate timing between live vaccines.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>It's important to follow vaccination schedules and guidelines provided by healthcare professionals or public health authorities for specific recommendations.

SRY gene deletion results in normal female phenotype with 46, XY karyotype. Mutations in genes involved in the testicular differentiation (WTl, SOX9, steroidogenic factor 1 and DAXl) are other causes of 46, XY gonadal dysgenesis.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>20 to 22 days Fetoplacental circulation Fetal circulation is established by 21st day after fertilization. The heart assumes its normal four-chambered shape by the end of six weeks of intrauterine life. From then on only minor changes occur and consist mainly in the growth of the heart as a whole with increasing age of the fetus. For the exchange of gases the fetus is dependent on placental circulation, whereas the neonate is dependent on the lungs. Immediately following birth, with the first inspiration, the lungs expand with air and the gas exchange function is transferred from the placenta to the lungs. This necessitates circulatory adjustments following birth to transform the fetal circulation to the postnatal circulation. Blood oxygenated in the placenta is returned by way of umbilical veins, which enter the fetus at the umbilicus and join the portal vein. The ductus venosus provides a low resistance bypass between the portal vein and the inferior vena cava. Most of the umbilical venous blood shunts through the ductus venosus to the inferior vena cava. Only a small proportion mixes with the portal venous blood and passes through the liver. Blood from inferior vena cava comprising that from hepatic veins, umbilical veins and that from lower extremities and kidneys enters the right atrium. On reaching the right atrium the bloodstream is divided into two by the inferior margin of septum secundum-the crista dividens. About one-third of the inferior vena cava blood enters the left atrium, through the foramen ovale, the rest two-third mixes with the venous return from the superior vena cava to enter   the right ventricle. The blood reaching the left atrium from the right atrium mixes with small amount of blood reaching the left atrium through the pulmonary veins and passes to the left ventricle. The left ventricle pumps out the blood into the ascending aorta for distribution to the coronaries, head and upper extremities. The superior vena cava stream, comprising blood returning from the head and arms, passes almost directly to the right ventricle. Only minor quantities (1 to 3%) reaches the left atrium. The right ventricle pumps out blood into the pulmonary trunk. A small amount of this blood enters the pulmonary circulation, the rest passes through the ductus arteriosus into the descend- ing aorta to mix with the small amount of blood reaching the descending aorta from the aortic arch (derived from the left ventricle). The main differences between the fetal and postnatal circulation are: Presence of placental circulation which provides gas exchange for the fetus Absence of gas exchange in the collapsed lungs; this results in very little flow of blood to the lungs and thus     little pulmonary venous return to left atrium Presence of ductus venosus, joining the portal vein with  the inferior vena cava, providing a low resistance bypass  for umbilical venous blood to reach the inferior vena cava Widely open foramen ovale to enable oxygenated blood (through umbilical veins) to reach the left atrium and ventricle for distribution to the coronaries and the brain and lastly Wide open ductus arteriosus to allow right ventricular blood to reach the descending aorta, since lungs are non-functioning.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Fetoplacental circulation begins to establish around 20 to 22 days of gestation in human development. The chorionic villi, finger-like projections from the chorion (outer fetal membrane), play a crucial role in the establishment of fetoplacental circulation. During fetoplacental circulation, maternal blood from the uterine arteries comes into close proximity with fetal blood in the chorionic villi. The close proximity of maternal and fetal blood allows for the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste products between the mother and the developing fetus. The placenta acts as a barrier between the maternal and fetal blood, preventing direct mixing of the two blood supplies while facilitating the exchange of substances.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Waste products , such as carbon dioxide and metabolic waste, diffuse from the fetal blood into the maternal blood, allowing for their removal from the fetal circulation. Hormone and antibody transfer: The placenta also serves as a site for the transfer of hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, from the mother to the fetus. Additionally, antibodies from the mother can pass through the placenta, providing passive immunity to the developing fetus. Developmental milestones: The establishment of fetoplacental circulation marks a crucial milestone in fetal development, as it ensures a constant supply of nutrients and oxygen necessary for growth and organogenesis.</p>\n<p></p>",

However, oral fluid therapy must  be commenced promptly and continued during transport. Fluid requirement is calculated under the following three headings: Provision of normal daily fluid requirements Rehydration to correct the existing water or electrolyte deficits Maintenance to replace ongoing losses to prevent recurrence of dehydration. The daily fluid requirements in children are calculated as follows: Up to 10 kg = 100 ml/kg 10\u201320 kg = 50 ml/kg > 20 kg = 20 ml/kg As an example, the daily fluid requirement in a child weighing 15 kg will be 1250 ml (first 10 kg, 10 x 100 =1000 ml; another: 5 kg, 5 x 50 = 250 ml, total 1000 + 250 = 1250 ml). Deficit replacement or rehydration therapy is calculated as 75 ml/kg of ORS, to be given over 4 hr. If ORS cannot be taken orally then nasogastric tube can be used.

Maintenance fluid therapy to replace losses. This phase should begin when signs of dehydration disappear, usually within 4 hr. ORS should be  administered  in  volumes  equal to diarrheal losses, usually to a maximum of 10 ml/kg per stool.  Breastfeeding  and  semisolid  food  are  continued after replacement of deficit. Plain water can be offered in between. Treatment Plan C: Children with \u2018Severe Dehydration\u2019 Intravenous fluids should be started immediately using Ringer lactate  with  5%  dextrose.  Normal  saline  or  plain  Ringer  solution  may  be  used  as  an  alternative,  but  5%  dextrose  alone is not effective. A total of 100 ml/kg of fluid is given, over 6 hr in children <12 months and over 3 hr in children >12 months as shown below. ORS solution should be started simultaneously if the child can take orally. If IV fluids cannot be given (for reasons of access, logistic availability or during transport), nasogastric feed- ing is given at 20 ml/kg/hr for 6 hr (total 120 ml/kg). The child should be reassessed every 1\u20132 hr; if there is repeated vomiting or abdominal distension, the oral or nasogastric fluids are given more slowly. If there is no improvement in hydration after 3 hr,    IV fluids should be started as early as possible. The child should be reassessed every 15\u201330 min for pulses and hydration status after the first bolus of 100 ml/kg of IV fluid. Management following intravenous hydration end is to be done as follows: Age 30 ml/kg 70 ml/kg < 12 months 1 hr 5 hr > 12 months 30 min 2 \u00bd hr Persistence of severe dehydration. Intravenous infusion is repeated. Hydration is improved but some dehydration is present. IV fluids are discontinued; ORS is administered over 4 hr according to Plan B There is no dehydration. IV fluids are discontinued; treatment Plan A is followed. The child should be observed for at least 6 hr before discharge, to confirm that the mother is able to maintain the child's hydration by giving ORS solution. Unique problems in infants below 2 months of age. Breastfeeding must continue during the rehydration process, whenever the infant is able to suck. Complications like septicemia, paralytic ileus and severe electrolyte disturbance are more likely in young infants with diarrhea than at later ages.  Diarrhea in these infants should be ideally treated as inpatient by experienced physicians at treatment centers with appropriate facilities. This allows for careful assessment of need of systemic antibiotics and monitoring.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Oral rehydration therapy to prevent dehydration Age ORS or other culturally appropriate ORT fluids after each loose stool ORS to provide for use at home <24 mo 50-100 mL 500 mL/day 2-10 yr 100-200 mL 1000 mL/day >10 yr Ad lib 2000 mL/day</p>\n<p></p>",
