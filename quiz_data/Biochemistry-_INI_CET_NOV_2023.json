      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Purine Salvage pathway Purine salvage pathway is utilized by monoclonal antibodies in hybridoma technology. In hybridoma technique monoclonal antibodies are produced using the HAT medium which contains hypoxanthine, thymidylate & aminopterin. Hybrid cells are cultured in HAT medium and monoclonal antibodies are obtained as substrate for the salvage pathway for purine nucleotides production.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>HYBRIDOMA TECHNOLOGY This is based on the fusion between myeloma cells (malignant plasma cells) and spleen cells from a suitably immunized animal. Spleen cells die in a short period under ordinary tissue culture conditions while myeloma cells are adopted to grow permanently in culture. Mutants of myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (azaquinine resistant) or thymidine kinase (bromodeoxy- uridine resistant). These mutants cannot grow in a medium containing aminopterin, supplemented with hypoxanthine and thymidine (HAT medium). Hybrids between the mutant myeloma cells and spleen cells can be selected and cultured in HAT medium. In short, the hybridoma technology for the production of monoclonal antibodies involves the following steps. Immunization of appropriate animals with antigen (need not be pure) under study. Fusion of suitable drug resistant myeloma cells with plasma cells, obtained from the spleen of the immunized animal. Selection and cloning of the hybrid cells that grow in culture and produce antibody molecules of desired class and specificity against the antigen of interest. Hybridoma technology can make available highly specific antibodies in abundant amounts.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - All other options are not correct.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Increased fatty acid synthesis Insulin is an anabolic hormone that promotes the storage of nutrients . In conditions of hyperinsulinemia (elevated levels of insulin), there is an increased tendency for the synthesis of fatty acids and storage of triglycerides. This is because insulin enhances the uptake of glucose and promotes its conversion into fatty acids through lipogenesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hyperinsulinemia contributes to increased fatty acid synthesis in the following ways Insulin and Lipogenesis: Insulin is an anabolic hormone, meaning it promotes the synthesis of molecules and storage of energy. In the liver, insulin stimulates lipogenesis, which is the process of converting excess glucose into fatty acids. This involves the activation of enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase. Stimulation of Glucose Uptake: Insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose by cells, especially in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Increased glucose availability provides the substrate for lipogenesis. In adipose tissue, glucose is converted into glycerol, which, along with fatty acids from the liver, is used for triglyceride synthesis. Inhibition of Lipolysis: Insulin inhibits lipolysis, the breakdown of stored triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol. This action helps to divert fatty acids toward synthesis and storage rather than their release into the bloodstream. Promotion of Fat Storage : Insulin promotes the storage of triglycerides in adipose tissue by enhancing the activity of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that facilitates the uptake of fatty acids into adipocytes. Effect on Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein (SREBP): Insulin influences the activity of SREBP, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of genes related to lipid synthesis. This further contributes to increased fatty acid synthesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A- Hyperketonemia is often associated with conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, where insulin levels may be insufficient. In hyperinsulinemia, the opposite is true, and ketone production is typically suppressed. Option: B- Hyperinsulinemia is not directly associated with an increase in circulating amino acids. Option: C - While insulin helps in glucose uptake and storage, hyperinsulinemia alone might not necessarily lead to raised glucose levels. Hyperinsulinemia is often seen in early stages of insulin resistance, where the body produces more insulin to maintain normal glucose levels.</p>\n<p></p>",
