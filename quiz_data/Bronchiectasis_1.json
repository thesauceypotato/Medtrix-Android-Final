Features: PCD can lead to chronic respiratory infections, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis due to impaired clearance of mucus and debris from the airways.

Chronic inflammation and infection lead to the accumulation of inflammatory cells, mucus, and cellular debris within the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles, causing their permanent dilation. Option: B. Desquamation of the lining epithelium: This is also a true feature of bronchiectasis. The chronic inflammatory process damages the lining epithelium of the bronchi, leading to desquamation or shedding of the cells. Option: C. Areas of ulceration - This is true as well.
