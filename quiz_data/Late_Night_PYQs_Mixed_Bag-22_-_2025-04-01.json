These clinical manifestations strongly suggest a diagnosis of bronchiectasis.</li><li>\u2022 Bronchiectasis is a chronic condition characterized by permanent dilation and destruction of the bronchi (airways) due to recurrent inflammation or infection. It leads to impaired clearance of secretions, resulting in the accumulation of thick, foul-smelling sputum within the dilated airways. The sputum production often increases upon postural changes, as described in this case, due to the pooling of secretions within the dilated bronchial segments.</li><li>\u2022 Bronchiectasis is a chronic condition characterized by permanent dilation and destruction of the bronchi (airways) due to recurrent inflammation or infection.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
