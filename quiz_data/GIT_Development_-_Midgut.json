      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>270 degree anticlockwise When we view the midgut loop from the ventral aspect, it makes a rotation of 270\u00b0 in the counterclockwise direction around the axis of the superior mesenteric artery. During rotation also, elongation of the intestinal loop and coiling of the jejunum and ileum takes place. The large intestine also shows elongation but without coiling. The total rotation of the midgut can be divided into three stages, each 90\u00b0. A 90\u00b0 rotation occurs during the herniation and the remaining 180\u00b0 during the return of the intestinal loop into the abdominal cavity.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Nondevelopment of nerve plexuses in the wall of a part of the intestinal tract may result in difficulty in the passage of intestinal contents through the part. Such a defect in the lower part of the colon gives rise to a condition in which the colon proximal to the defective segment becomes greatly distended with its contents. This condition is called megacolon or Hirschsprung\u2019s disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. 180 degree anticlockwise +last 90-degree rotation does not take place Partial rotation: In this anomaly, the first 180\u00b0 of rotation takes place normally, but the last 90\u00b0 of rotation does not take place. As a result, the cecum and appendix, instead of being on the right side of the abdominal cavity, are located just below the pylorus of the stomach. Option C. 90 degree anticlockwise Occasionally, however, rotation amounts to 90\u00b0 only. When this occurs, the colon and cecum are the first portions of the gut to return from the umbilical cord, and they settle on the left side of the abdominal cavity. The later returning loops then move more and more to the right, resulting in a left-sided colon. Option D. 90-degree Clockwise Reversed rotation of the intestinal loop occurs when the primary loop rotates 90\u00b0 clockwise. In this abnormality, the transverse colon passes behind the duodenum and lies behind the superior mesenteric artery.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Situs inversus - In this condition, all abdominal and thoracic viscera are laterally transposed, i.e. all parts normally on the right side are seen on the left side, and vice versa.

Failure of return of physiological hernia can result in omphalocele. It occurs because the bowel (particularly the ileum) grows faster than the abdominal cavity during the early gestational period.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Ladd\u2019s Bands Green coloured arrow marked structure is Ladd\u2019s band. Ladd's bands, sometimes called bands of Ladd, are fibrous stalks of peritoneal tissue that attach the cecum to the retroperitoneum in the right lower quadrant (RLQ). Obstructing Ladd's Bands are associated with malrotation of the intestine, a developmental disorder in which the cecum is found in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), instead of its normal anatomical position in the RLQ. Ladd's bands then pass over the second part of the duodenum, causing extrinsic compression and obstruction. This clinically manifests as poor feeding and bilious vomiting in neonates. Screening can be performed with an upper GI series.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The most severe complication of malrotation is midgut volvulus, in which the mesenteric base twists around the superior mesenteric artery, compromising intestinal perfusion and leading to bowel necrosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B. Greater Omentum The greater omentum is a large apron-like fold of visceral peritoneum that hangs down from the stomach. It extends from the greater curvature of the stomach, passing in front of the small intestines and doubles back to ascend to the transverse colon before reaching to the posterior abdominal wall. Option C. Gastrocolic ligament The gastrocolic ligament is a portion of the greater omentum that stretches from, the greater curvature of the stomach to the transverse colon. It forms part of the anterior wall of the lesser sac. Dividing the gastrocolic ligament provides access to the anterior pancreas and the posterior wall of the stomach. This is commonly done for Whipple procedures, distal pancreatectomy, some forms of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and exploratory laparotomy. Option D. splenocolic ligament The splenocolic ligament is a peritoneal ligament connecting the splenic capsule to the transverse colon. Made of visceral peritoneum, it lies between the greater omentum and the transverse mesocolon. It has three attached borders, superiorly to the spleen, inferiorly to the splenic flexure of the transverse colon and posteriorly to the pancreatic colic ligament, which itself is attached posteriorly to the left kidney, and a free anterior one Of clinical relevance, one cause of exercise-induced pain in one's left side (a side stitch) is stretching of this ligament and the peritoneum when the spleen swells from exertion.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>A surgical operation called a \"Ladd procedure\" is performed to alleviate intestinal malrotation. The procedure involves counterclockwise detorsion of the bowel, surgical division of Ladd's bands, widening of the small intestine's mesentery, performing an appendectomy, and reorientation of the small bowel on the right and the cecum and colon on the left (the appendectomy is performed so as not to be confused by atypical presentation of appendicitis at a later date). Most Ladd surgical repairs take place in infancy or childhood.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Non-rotation of midgut When the midgut fails to rotate further after the first 90 degrees of counterclockwise rotation, it will lead to the development of a small intestine to the right side and a large intestine (radiograph) to the left side of the abdominal cavity. The condition is known as non-rotation. These rotation anomalies of the gut can occur due to persistent ladd\u2019s band.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Non-rotation : In this anomaly, the midgut loop fails to rotate. The caudal or post arterial segment returns first in the abdominal cavity. Hence, the large intestine occupies the left side of the abdominal cavity while the small intestine derived from pre- arterial segment returns later and occupies the right side of the abdominal cavity. Reversed rotation : In this anomaly, the midgut loop rotates clockwise instead of anticlockwise. In this condition, the transverse colon passes behind the duodenum and lies behind the superior mesenteric artery. Subhepatic cecum and appendix (undescended cecum and appendix) : The cecum develops from a cecum bud\u2014a small conical dilatation that appears in the caudal segment of midgut loop near its apex at about the sixth week of IUL. When the caudal segment of the midgut loop returns to the abdominal cavity, the cecum lies below the liver ( subhepatic position ), as the post-arterial segment of the midgut loop elongates to form ascending colon, the cecum and appendix acquire a definitive position in the right iliac fossa. But if the ascending colon does not form or remains too short, the cecum does not descend and remains permanently below the liver leading to a congenital anomaly called subhepatic cecum and appendix.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B. Reverse rotation of the midgut Reversed rotation: In this anomaly, the midgut loop rotates clockwise instead of anticlockwise.

Subhepatic cecum The cecum develops from a cecum bud\u2014a small conical dilatation that appears in the caudal segment of the midgut loop near its apex at about the sixth week of IUL.

But if the ascending colon does not form or remains too short, the cecum does not descend and remains permanently below the liver leading to a congenital anomaly called subhepatic cecum and appendix. Option D. Partial rotation Partial rotation: In this anomaly, the first 180\u00b0 of rotation takes place normally but the last 90\u00b0 of rotation does not take place. As a result, the cecum and appendix, instead of being on the right side of the abdominal cavity, are located just below the pylorus of the stomach.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In cases of the subhepatic cecum and appendix, the inflammation of the appendix ( appendicitis ) would cause tenderness in the right hypochondrium, possibly leading to a mistaken diagnosis of chole-cystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder).</p>\n<p></p>",

Diaphragmatic Atresia Diaphragmatic atresia is not a cause of volvulus. Subhepatic cecum is due to failure of the descent of the cecal bud and results in the absence of an ascending colon. Option B. Congenital megacolon Congenital megacolon is due to faulty migration of neural crest cells into the wall of the colon, which causes a lack of parasympathetic postganglionic neurons. Option D. Duplication of the intestine Duplication of the intestine would not cause volvulus because there would still be a fixed mesentery and no free movement of the intestines.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Typically, the neonate of midgut volvulus is entirely normal for a period and then suddenly presents with bilious vomiting. Unless the volvulus is reduced (or reduces spontaneously), the superior mesenteric vein wrapped around the superior mesenteric artery causes progressive venous obstruction, gradual onset of ischaemia, and eventual necrosis. As this occurs, the abdomen becomes swollen and tender as fluid accumulates in the lumen of the bowel. Eventually, in severe, untreated cases, peritonitis and shock can result in severe morbidity and, sometimes, mortality.</p>\n<p></p>",
