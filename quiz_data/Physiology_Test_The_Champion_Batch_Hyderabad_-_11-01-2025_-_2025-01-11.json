Upon exposure to a triggering agent, these receptors release excessive calcium into the myoplasm, even in response to sub-threshold stimuli. Effects of Excess Calcium: Increased Muscle Contraction: Elevated intracellular calcium levels lead to sustained and excessive muscle contractions, which manifest as muscle rigidity. Heat Generation: Muscle contractions consume ATP, which generates heat. The excessive calcium cycling and ATP consumption result in hyperthermia. Energy Depletion and Acidosis: The metabolic activity overwhelms the muscle\u2019s energy supply, causing lactic acidosis and further worsening the condition.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. D) Aortic valve opens at 5</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The pressure-volume loop represents changes in left ventricular pressure and volume during a cardiac cycle. Each segment of the loop corresponds to a specific phase of the cardiac cycle:</li><li>\u2022 pressure-volume loop</li><li>\u2022 1 to 2 (Ventricular Filling): Represents ventricular diastole . Volume increases significantly as blood fills the ventricle. Pressure remains low due to ventricular compliance. 2 to 3 (Isovolumetric Contraction): The mitral valve closes at Point 2, and the ventricle begins contracting with no volume change. Pressure rises steeply during this phase. 3 to 5 (Ejection Phase): The aortic valve opens at Point 3, allowing blood to be ejected. Volume decreases as pressure initially rises (due to continued contraction) and then decreases as ejection slows. 5 to 7 (Isovolumetric Relaxation): The aortic valve closes at Point 5. The ventricle relaxes without a change in volume, leading to a sharp pressure drop. 7 to 1 (Filling Phase): The mitral valve opens at Point 7, starting the filling phase again. At Point 5, the aortic valve opens, allowing blood to be ejected from the left ventricle into the aorta.</li><li>\u2022 1 to 2 (Ventricular Filling): Represents ventricular diastole .
