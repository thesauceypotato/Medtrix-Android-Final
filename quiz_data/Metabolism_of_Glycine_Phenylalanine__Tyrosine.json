This enzyme converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. As a result, there is an accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood and tyrosine becomes essential. Severe mental retardation occurs due to excess phenylalanine but the child is normal at birth as no problem during fetal development because the maternal enzyme breaks down phenylalanine.
