Immediate irrigation and debridement are crucial to prevent infection.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Open fractures occur when a bone breaks through the skin, exposing the fracture to the external environment, often due to high-energy trauma. These injuries are classified by the Gustilo-Anderson system into three types based on wound size, degree of contamination, and soft tissue involvement. Immediate irrigation and debridement are critical to remove contaminants and reduce infection risk. Tscherne described four eras of open fracture treatment, emphasizing life preservation, limb preservation, infection avoidance, and function preservation.</li><li>\u2022 For fixation, the choice of method depends on the extent of contamination and soft tissue damage. In Type I and II fractures, early internal fixation with intramedullary nails or plates may be used if managed within 6 hours. For higher-grade injuries, such as Type IIIB and IIIC, external fixation is often preferred initially to stabilize the fracture while allowing repeated wound debridement. External fixation devices, including the Ilizarov fixator, work externally to the skin and support gradual bone healing through principles like distraction osteogenesis, which can correct deformities and manage severe injuries.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Compartment syndrome is common in open fractures due to high-pressure buildup: This statement is incorrect because compartment syndrome is rare in open fractures. The communication with the external environment allows pressure to be released, preventing dangerous compartment pressure buildup.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Compartment syndrome is common in open fractures due to high-pressure buildup:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Definitive internal fixation should be performed immediately, regardless of contamination: Immediate internal fixation is avoided in highly contaminated fractures due to the increased risk of infection. Instead, external fixation is initially used to manage the injury and allow for wound management before proceeding to definitive fixation.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Definitive internal fixation should be performed immediately, regardless of contamination:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Open fractures of the tibia are less likely to result in complications compared to closed fractures: Open fractures pose a higher risk of complications, including infection, non-union, and delayed healing, compared to closed fractures, primarily due to the direct exposure of the bone to external contaminants and significant soft tissue injury.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Open fractures of the tibia are less likely to result in complications compared to closed fractures:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Open fractures require immediate irrigation, debridement, and stabilization to reduce infection risks. Compartment syndrome is rare due to the open nature of the wound, which prevents pressure buildup. The type and method of fixation depend on the severity of the injury, with external fixation often used initially in contaminated wounds to stabilize the fracture and facilitate repeated debridement before definitive management.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

This is achieved by firm longitudinal traction to the hand against counter-traction by an assistant who grasps the arm above the flexed elbow. This step restores length to the radius and disengages the fractured bone ends. Palmar flexion: The surgeon presses the distal fragment into palmar flexion using the thumb. This maneuver corrects the dorsal angulation of the distal fragment, which is characteristic of the \"dinner fork\" deformity seen in Colles' fractures. Ulnar deviation: As the palmar flexion is applied, the patient's hand is drawn into ulnar deviation. This step corrects the radial deviation typically seen in these fractures and restores normal radial inclination. Application of plaster of Paris: Once the reduction is achieved, a plaster cast is applied extending from below the elbow to the metacarpal heads. The cast maintains the corrected position of pronation, palmar flexion, and ulnar deviation.</li><li>\u2022 Traction: The first step is to disimpact the fragments.

Immediate closed reduction under conscious sedation</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The patient presents with a posterior hip dislocation, a serious injury often resulting from high-impact trauma like a motor vehicle accident. The clinical presentation of severe hip pain, inability to move the leg, and the characteristic leg position (shortened, internally rotated, and adducted) is highly suggestive of this diagnosis. Radiographs confirm the dislocation without any associated fractures.</li><li>\u2022 Posterior Dislocation of the Hip</li><li>\u2022 Posterior Dislocation of the Hip</li><li>\u2022 This is the most common type of hip dislocation (90%).

The lesser trochanter may not be visible due to internal rotation of the thigh. Shenton's line, a continuous arc formed by the inferior border of the superior pubic ramus and the medial border of the femoral neck, will be disrupted. A CT scan is the most accurate imaging modality to assess the dislocation and associated fractures.</li><li>\u2022 The X-ray will show the femoral head displaced posterior to the acetabulum.</li><li>\u2022 The lesser trochanter may not be visible due to internal rotation of the thigh.</li><li>\u2022 Shenton's line, a continuous arc formed by the inferior border of the superior pubic ramus and the medial border of the femoral neck, will be disrupted.</li><li>\u2022 A CT scan is the most accurate imaging modality to assess the dislocation and associated fractures.</li><li>\u2022 Treatment</li><li>\u2022 Treatment</li><li>\u2022 Immediate closed reduction is the primary goal.

Colle\u2019s fracture. Colles\u2019s fracture is fracture of lower end of radius at its corti-cocancellous junction mostly occurring in post-menopausal osteoporotic elderly women, as a result of fall on outstretched hand, with wrist in extension. It is one of the most common fractures in elderly. Most Colles fractures can be successfully treated nonoperatively, and cast (hand-shaking cast) is applied on opposite forces to displacement. Complications include finger stiffness (most common), malunion (2nd most common) leading to dinner fork deformity.

Smith\u2019s fracture . A Smith fracture is a break to the end of the radius. The end part of the bone, which forms part of the wrist joint, is displaced or angled in the direction of the palm of the hand. Often, this injury occurs by a fall to the back of a flexed wrist but can occur in any fall to an outstretched hand. Smith fracture is treated by close reduction and immobilization in long arm (above elbow) cast with forearm in supination and wrist in extension (dorsiflexion).</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Smith\u2019s fracture</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Monteggia fracture. Fractures between the proximal third of the ulna and the base of olecranon combined with dislocation of the proximal radioulnar joint. The clue to successful treatment is to restore the length of the fractured ulna; only then can the dislocated joint be fully reduced and remain stable. In adults, treatment is reduction and fixation. In children, treatment is reduction and cast application. Posterior interosseous nerve has been most commonly injured nerve in association with Monteggia fracture dislocation because it takes a turn around radial head and is injured with its dislocation. This causes paralysis of thumb and finger extensors.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.
