Management: The management of unilateral undescended testis may vary based on the age of the child and the specific circumstances. In many cases, the testis will descend into the scrotum on its own within the first few months of life. If the testis has not descended by the age of 6 months, treatment options may include hormone therapy to stimulate descent or surgical intervention (orchidopexy) to bring the testis down into the scrotum. Importance of Treatment: The goal of treatment is to ensure that the undescended testis is properly positioned in the scrotum.
