      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Like Schiotz tonometry, applanation tonometry reflects ocular rigidity. Unlike Schiotz tonometry , applanation tonometry displaces a very small volume of aqueous humor from the eye and does not significantly increase intraocular pressure (IOP). For this reason, applanation measurements are essentially independent of ocular rigidity.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Because of its simplicity, reliability, low price, and relative accuracy, it is the most widely used tonometer in the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option : A . Goldmann Applanation Tonometer is considered to be the gold standard instrument for the measurement of Intraocular pressure (IOP). It is an instrument that is based on the Imbert-Fick law . It is based on the Fick principle, which holds that the pressure inside an ideal sphere is equal to the force required to flatten the sphere divided by the area of flattening. Option : B . Goldmann applanation tonometer is based on the Imbert\u2013Fick principle, which states that for a dry thin-walled sphere, the pressure (P) inside the sphere equals the force (F) necessary to flatten its surface divided by the area (A) of flattening (i.e. P = F/A) . It applies to surfaces that are perfectly spherical, dry, flexible, elastic, and infinitely thin. Theoretically, average corneal rigidity (taken as 520 \u03bcm for GAT) and the capillary attraction of the tear meniscus cancel each other out when the flattened area has the 3.06 mm diameter contact surface of the Goldmann prism , which is applied to the cornea using the Goldmann tonometer with a measurable amount of force from which the IOP is deduced.

This is because insufficient pigment has filtered through the trabecular meshwork to form a visible pigmented line. If pigmentation is apparent, it is usually most prominent in the inferior angle Option: B. The two most common conditions in which the pigment band is very prominent are pigment dispersion syndrome/pigmentary glaucoma and PXF glaucoma. Pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS ) is characterized by the liberation of pigment granules from iris pigment epithelium and their deposition throughout the anterior segment. Secondary pigmentary glaucoma (PG) is common. PDS and PG are more common in males, particularly young myopic white men. In primary PDS/PG, pigment shedding is precipitated by rubbing the posterior pigment layer of the iris against the zonules as a result of excessive posterior bowing of the mid-peripheral portion of the iris Option: C.
