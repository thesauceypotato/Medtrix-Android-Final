      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Proteins The thermic effect of food (TEF) refers to the increase in energy expenditure that occurs during the digestion, absorption, and metabolism of nutrients in the body. This effect varies depending on the macronutrient composition of the food consumed. Let's examine each option in detail and discuss their thermic effects: Proteins: Proteins have the highest thermic effect among the three macronutrients . When you consume protein-rich foods, your body needs to expend more energy to break down and process the proteins. This is because proteins are composed of amino acids, and the body requires energy to convert them into usable forms. The thermic effect of proteins ranges from 20% to 30% of the total caloric intake from protein.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option: B. Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates have a moderate thermic effect. The thermic effect of carbohydrates ranges from 5% to 10% of the total caloric intake from carbohydrates. Option: C. Fats: Fats have the lowest thermic effect among the macronutrients. The thermic effect of fats ranges from 0% to 5% of the total caloric intake from fats. Option: D. Fatty acids: Fatty acids are the building blocks of fats, and their thermic effect is similar to that of fats. In summary, proteins have the highest thermic effect among the options listed. Consuming protein-rich foods can increase your metabolic rate more significantly compared to carbohydrates and fats.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Thiophorase Thiophorase, also known as succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase, is the enzyme that is absent in the liver, preventing it from using ketone bodies (KB) as a fuel source. The liver plays a crucial role in ketone body metabolism. During periods of prolonged fasting or low carbohydrate intake, the liver produces ketone bodies (acetoacetate and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate) through a process called ketogenesis. These ketone bodies are then released into the bloodstream and can be used as an alternative fuel source by various tissues, including the brain, heart, and skeletal muscles. However, the liver lacks the enzyme thiophorase (succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase) necessary to utilize the ketone bodies it produces. This enzyme is required to convert acetoacetate into acetoacetyl-CoA, which can then be further metabolized into two molecules of acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is a central molecule in energy metabolism and can enter the citric acid cycle (also known as the Kreb\u2019s cycle) to produce ATP. Due to the absence of thiophorase in the liver, the liver cannot use ketone bodies as an energy source. Instead, the liver releases ketone bodies into the bloodstream for other tissues to utilize. This allows other organs, particularly the brain, to switch to ketone bodies as a fuel source during periods of fasting or carbohydrate restriction, preserving glucose for organs that depend on it, such as red blood cells and certain parts of the brain.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option C. HMG CoA synthase: HMG CoA synthase is not directly related to the utilization of ketone bodies in the liver. It is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), a precursor molecule in the production of cholesterol and ketone bodies. However, the absence of HMG CoA synthase would impact the overall synthesis of ketone bodies rather than their utilization. Option D .HMG CoA reductase: HMG CoA reductase is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of mevalonate, which is a precursor molecule in the production of cholesterol. However, the absence of HMG CoA reductase in the liver would not directly affect the utilization of ketone bodies. It would primarily impact the synthesis of cholesterol and other downstream products.</p>\n<p></p>",

Rothera's Test is a commonly used laboratory test to detect the presence of ketone bodies, specifically acetoacetate, in urine or blood samples. It is particularly relevant in the context of diabetes mellitus, as individuals with uncontrolled diabetes, especially type I diabetes, may experience an increase in ketone production. In type I diabetes, the body is unable to produce sufficient insulin, resulting in a lack of glucose utilization by cells for energy. As a result, the body begins to break down fats as an alternative energy source, leading to the production of ketone bodies, including acetoacetate. Rothera's Test involves the reaction of acetoacetate with sodium nitroprusside and glycine in an alkaline medium. This reaction forms a purple-colored complex, indicating the presence of ketone bodies.

One of these intermediates is xanthurenic acid. In individuals with a deficiency of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), the conversion of tryptophan to niacin (vitamin B3) is impaired.
