      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Right lateral corticospinal tract and right dorsal column The lateral corticospinal tract contains over 90% of the fibers present in the corticospinal tract and runs the length of the spinal cord. The primary function of the lateral corticospinal tract is to control the voluntary movement of contralateral limbs. Due to the pyramidal decussation of the lateral corticospinal tract in the caudal medulla, damage rostral or caudal to this decussation will be the defining feature of whether there will be ipsilateral or contralateral deficits. For example: If there is a lesion in the precentral gyrus of the left cerebral cortex, the patient will exhibit upper motor neuron signs with damage to the right side of the body. Contrarily, if spinal cord damage is on the left side (below the pyramidal decussation), motor deficits will be present on the left side of the body. If there is spinal cord damage at the level of the anterior horn, then lower motor neuron signs will be present with ipsilateral deficits. The dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway is a sensory pathway of the central nervous system that conveys sensations of fine touch, vibration, two-point discrimination, and proprioception (position) from the skin and joints. The pathway receives information from sensory receptors throughout the body and carries this in nerve tracts in the white matter of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord to the medulla, where it is continued in the medial lemniscus, onto the thalamus and relayed from there through the internal capsule and transmitted to the somatosensory cortex.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome may be caused by injury to the spinal cord resulting from a spinal cord tumor, trauma [such as a fall or injury from gunshot or puncture to the cervical or thoracic spine], ischemia (obstruction of a blood vessel), or infectious or inflammatory diseases such as tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis. As a result of the injury to these three main brain pathways the patient will present with three lesions: The corticospinal lesion produces spastic paralysis on the same side of the body below the level of the lesion (due to loss of moderation by the UMN). At the level of the lesion, there will be flaccid paralysis of the muscles supplied by the nerve of that level (since lower motor neurons are affected at the level of the lesion). The lesion to fasciculus gracilis or fasciculus cuneatus (dorsal column) results in ipsilateral loss of vibration and proprioception (position sense) and loss of all sensation of fine touch. The loss of the spinothalamic tract leads to pain and temperature sensation being lost from the contralateral side, beginning one or two segments below the lesion.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B.

Left lateral corticospinal tract and right dorsal column Option B, C, and D are incorrect answers because the patient present with right-sided flaccid paralysis with a diminished vibratory sense ipsilaterally, decreased sensation to light touch at the level of his laceration so, Right lateral corticospinal tract and right dorsal column will be involved.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome is caused by damage to one half of the spinal cord, i.e., hemisection of the spinal cord resulting in paralysis and loss of proprioception on the same (or ipsilateral) side as the injury or lesion, and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the opposite (or contralateral) side as the lesion.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dorsal column pathway The dorsal column is a three-order neuronal pathway that functions as a method of signal transmission throughout the spinal cord to the brainstem. This pathway specifically controls conscious appreciation of vibration, fine touch, 2-point discrimination, and proprioception. Specifically, in cases of neurosyphilis, or tabes dorsalis, there is demyelination of the axonal fibers of the posterior column or dorsal pathway of the spinal cord. This demyelination leads to severe sensory deficits of the pathway, including position sense or proprioception. Due to its high specificity, a positive Romberg sign is highly suggestive of diagnosing a deficit involving the dorsal column and medial lemniscus</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Romberg's test, Romberg's sign, or the Romberg maneuver, is a test used in an exam of neurological function for balance. The exam is based on the premise that a person requires at least two of the three following senses to maintain balance while standing: proprioception (the ability to know one's body position in space); vestibular function (the ability to know one's head position in space); and vision (which can be used to monitor and adjust for changes in body position). The Romberg test is a test of the body's sense of positioning (proprioception), which requires healthy functioning of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Corticospinal Pathway Due to its high specificity, a positive Romberg sign is highly suggestive of diagnosing a deficit involving the dorsal column and medial lemniscus pathways, therefore Option A is incorrect answer. Option: B. Cerebellovestibular pathway Option: D. Cortico Cerebellar Pathway Although the cerebellum is also involved with coordination, Romberg's test detects the integrity of the posterior dorsal columns and proprioception, the body's awareness of its own movement and position in space. It is important to understand that a negative romberg test does not confirm cerebellar dysfunction, therefore both option B and D are incorrect answers.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Romberg sign and cerebellar function Romberg's test is not a test of cerebellar function, as it is commonly misconstrued. Patients with severe cerebellar ataxia will generally be unable to balance even with their eyes open;therefore, the test cannot proceed beyond the first step and no patient with cerebellar ataxia can correctly be described as Romberg's positive. Rather, Romberg's test is a test of the proprioception receptors and pathways function. A positive Romberg's test which will show wide base gait in patients with back pain has been shown to be 90 percent specific for lumbar spinal stenosis.</p>\n<p></p>",
