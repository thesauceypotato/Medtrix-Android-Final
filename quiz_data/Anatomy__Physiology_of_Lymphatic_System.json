      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Axillary group of LN Lymphoedema of the arm is a troublesome complication of breast cancer treatment, fortunately, seen less often now that radical axillary dissection and radiotherapy are rarely combined. However, it does still occur occasionally after either mode of treatment alone and appears at any time from months to years after treatment. There is usually no precipitating cause but recurrent tumors should be excluded because neoplastic infiltration of the axilla can cause arm swelling as a result of both lymphatic and venous blockage. So, lymph keeps on accumulating in the limb resulting in lymphoedema. This neoplastic infiltration is often painful because of brachial plexus nerve involvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Lymphoedema: Lymphoedema may be defined as abnormal limb swelling caused by the accumulation of increased amounts of high protein ISF secondary to defective lymphatic drainage in the presence of (near) normal net capillary filtration Pathology: Result of an inability of the existing lymphatic system to accommodate the protein and fluid entering the interstitial compartment at the tissue level. Stages : First Stage -  Soft pitting edema (impaired lymphatic drainage results in protein-rich fluid accumulation in the interstitial compartment) Second Stage - Nonpitting and Spongy consistency (the clinical condition is further exacerbated by the accumulation of fibroblasts, adipocytes, and, perhaps most important, macrophages in the affected tissues, which culminates in a local inflammatory response) Third Stage - Lymphostatic Elephantiasis (excessive subcutaneous fibrosis and scarring with associated severe skin change). Edema is irreversible at this stage. Aetiological classification of lymphoedema: Primary lymphoedema Congenital (onset <2 years old): sporadic; familial (Nonne\u2013Milroy\u2019s disease) Praecox (onset 2\u201335 years old): sporadic; familial (Letessier\u2013Meige\u2019s disease) Tarda (onset after 35 years old) Secondary lymphoedema A parasitic infection (filariasis) Fungal infection (tinea pedis) Exposure to foreign body material (silica particles) Primary malignancy Metastatic spread to lymph nodes Radiotherapy to lymph nodes Surgical excision of lymph nodes Trauma (particularly degloving injuries) Superficial thrombophlebitis Deep venous thrombosis. Diagnosis : Unlike other types of edema, lymphoedema characteristically involves the foot. The contour of the ankle is lost through infilling of the Sub malleolar depressions, A \u2018buffalo hump\u2019 forms on the dorsum of the foot, The toes appear \u2018square\u2019 because of the confinement of footwear and The skin on the dorsum of the toes cannot be pinched because of subcutaneous fibrosis (Stemmer\u2019s sign) .
