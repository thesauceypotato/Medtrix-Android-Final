The QR segment corresponds to ventricular depolarization , which is Phase 0 of the myocyte action potential and is characterized by sodium influx. This coordinated action of ventricular myocytes is caused by the opening of the fast Na+ channels that allow an influx of Na+ ions into the cell in Phase 0 of the action potential, leading to rapid depolarization. This portion of the action potential is affected by Class I antiarrhythmics, such as propafenone and flecainide. Image A shows a labeled beat with a P wave, QRS complex, and T wave.

In addition, strong vagal stimulation can decrease the strength of heart muscle contraction by 20 to 30 percent. Such as in athletes. The vagal fibers are distributed mainly to the atria and not much to the ventricles, where the power contraction of the heart occurs. This distribution explains why the effect of vagal stimulation is mainly to decrease the heart rate rather than to greatly decrease the strength of heart contraction. Nevertheless, the great decrease in heart rate combined with a slight decrease in heart contraction strength can decrease ventricular pumping by 50 percent or more.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A.

Thus, P waves are positive in lead II and usually in leads I, aVL, and aVF, reflecting the leftward and inferior direction of activation during sinus rhythm.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>In normal heart ventricles, current flows from negative to positive primarily in the direction from the base of the heart toward the apex during almost the entire cycle of depolarization, except at the very end. In recording limb lead I, the negative terminal of the electrocardiograph is connected to the right arm, and the positive terminal is connected to the left arm. Therefore, when the point where the right arm connects to the chest is electronegative with respect to the point where the left arm connects, the electrocardiograph records positively, that is, above the zero voltage line in the ECG. When the opposite is true, the electrocardiograph records below the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. Ventricular depolarization normally starts with the subendocardium (or endocardium) and spreads across the ventricular wall to the epicardium. Option B. Lead I has the positive electrode on the left arm, and the negative electrode on the right arm, and therefore measures the potential difference between the two arms. Option C. AV nodal conduction is faster than atrial conduction.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Atrial depolarization, ventricular depolarization, and ventricular repolarization move away from the exploring electrode, and the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave are, therefore, all negative (downward) deflections; aVL and aVF look at the ventricles, and the deflections are therefore predominantly positive or biphasic. There is no Q wave in V1 and V2, and the initial portion of the QRS complex is a small upward deflection because ventricular depolarization first moves across the midportion of the septum from left to right toward the exploring electrode. The wave of excitation then moves down the septum and into the left ventricle away from the electrode, producing a large S wave. Finally, it moves back along the ventricular wall toward the electrode, producing the return to the isoelectric line. Conversely, in the left ventricular leads (V4 \u2013V6 ) there may be an initial small Q wave (left to right septal depolarization), and there is a large R wave (septal and left ventricular depolarization) followed in V4 and V5 by a moderate S wave (late depolarization of the ventricular walls moving back toward the AV junction). It should be noted that there is considerable variation in the position of the normal heart, and the position affects the configuration of the electrocardiographic complexes in the various leads.</p>\n<p></p>",
