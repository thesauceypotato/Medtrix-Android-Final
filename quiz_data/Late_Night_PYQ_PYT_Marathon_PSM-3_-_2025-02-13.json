During this event, they employed a systematic approach to ensure maximum impact. They started by making people aware of the importance of hand hygiene, followed by sparking interest through demonstrations and interactive sessions. Subsequently, they gauged the audience's understanding and openness to the idea, and finally, they encouraged and supported the adoption of these practices in their daily routine.
