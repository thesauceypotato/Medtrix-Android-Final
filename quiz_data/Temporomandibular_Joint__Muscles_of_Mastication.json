Medial Pterygoid The medial pterygoid muscle has functions including elevating the mandible (closing the mouth), protruding the mandible, mastication (especially when the maxillary teeth and the mandibular teeth are close together), and excursing the mandible (contralateral excursion occurs unilateral contraction) Option:B. Lateral pterygoid The lateral pterygoid muscle depresses the mandible and opens the mouth when assisted by the anterior belly of the digastric muscle and the mylohyoid muscle Option:C. Masseter The masseter muscle is one of the four muscles responsible for the action of mastication (chewing). When the masseter contracts it causes powerful elevation of the mandible causing the mouth to close.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>PTERYGOID PLEXUS OF VEINS It lies around and within the lateral pterygoid muscle. The tributaries of the plexus correspond to the branches of the maxillary artery. The plexus is drained by the maxillary vein which begins at the posterior end of the plexus and unites with the superficial temporal vein to form the retromandibular vein. Thus, the maxillary vein accompanies only the first part of the maxillary artery. The plexus communicates: a. With the inferior ophthalmic vein through the inferior orbital fissure. b. With the cavernous sinus through the emissary\u2019s veins. c. With the facial vein (FV) through the deep facial vein. The facial vein communicates with inferior ophthalmic veins. Thus infection from FV/inferior ophthalmic vein can reach the cavernous sinus causing its thrombosis and palsy of cranial nerves in the sinus.</p>\n<p></p>",

Mylohyoid The mandible is depressed by gravity (prime mover), lateral pterygoid muscle, and suprahyoid muscles (digastrics, geniohyoid, mylohyoid). Depression of the mandible is brought about mainly by the lateral pterygoid. The digastric, geniohyoid, and mylohyoid muscles help when the mouth is opened wide or against resistance. The origin of only the lateral pterygoid is anterior, slightly lower, and medial to its insertion. During contraction, it rotates the head of the mandible and opens the mouth. During the wide opening, it pulls the articular disc forwards. So, movement occurs in both compartments. It is also done passively by gravity.</p>\n<p></p>",

From the nasal bridge, the fracture enters the medial wall of the orbit to involve the lacrimal bone and then crosses the inferior orbital rim, usually at the junction of the medial one-third and lateral two-thirds, and often involves the infraorbital foramen. The fracture line then runs beneath the zygomaticomaxillary suture, traversing the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus to extend posteriorly and horizontally across the pterygoid plates. The zygomatic bones and arches remain attached to the skull.</p>\n<p></p>",
