      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Fungi The symptoms of persistent fever and neutropenia (small number of PMNs) reflect a probable infectious disease process. Failure to associate bacteria and/or viruses with an infectious disease process and clinical history might justify the consideration of a fungal etiology. Most fungi reside in nature and are essential in breaking down and recycling organic matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The mycoses with the highest incidence\u2014 candidiases and dermatophytosis \u2014are caused by fungi that are part of the usual or normal microbial flora of humans. Pathogenic fungi do not produce patent toxins, and the mechanisms of fungal pathogenicity are complex and multifocal, often making these infections hard to treat. The relatively low numbers of fungi in the infection and medium requirements make fungi (choice A) more difficult to isolate, identify, and relate to a medical condition. Gram-positive (choice C) and gram-negative (choice B) bacteria will usually be isolated from clinical specimens. Viral isolation (choice D) is routinely performed successfully today.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B & C - Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria will usually be isolated from clinical specimens.

His past medical history was notable for insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension, and mitral valve replacement. Their social history was unremarkable; he was a retired shipyard laborer. The patient's wife denied recent travel or pets. The history goes back ten days before presentation when the patient was evaluated at an outside institution for persistent headaches and gait ataxia. At that time, computed tomography of the head was negative for an acute bleed or mass. The patient was presumed to have metabolic encephalopathy and was admitted to the rehabilitation ward for further evaluation of the gait disturbance. He was transferred back to the medical ward for a change in mental status and worsening encephalopathy. Initial vital signs were notable for a maximum temperature of 101.2\u00b0F, BP 120/70 mmHg, pulse 78 beats/min., and respiratory rate 20 breaths/min. Physical examination revealed a lethargic man, but who was arousable to verbal and tactile stimuli; he moved all extremities. Their reflexes were intact and he followed simple commands. The remainder of the physical exam was normal. Admission labs were notable for glucose of 225 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, ammonia level of 58 umol/L, and WBC count of 14.3 \u00d7 103cells/mm3 (81% neutrophils, 10% lymphocytes).

Symptoms are those of pneumonia , meningitis , or involvement of skin, bones, or viscera. These organisms are found in the soil, and infection occurs following inhalation of the infectious forms of these fungi when sites containing the organism are disturbed.
