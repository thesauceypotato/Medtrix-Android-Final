      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>CLINICAL ANIRIDIA CONGENITAL ANIRIDIA (IRIDREMIA) It refers to the congenital absence of iris. True aniridia,i.e., complete absence of the iris is extremely rare. Usually, a peripheral rim of the iris is present and this condition is called \u2018Clinical aniridia'. Zonules of the lens and ciliary processes are often visible. The condition is usually familial and may be associated with glaucoma due to angle anomalies.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. COLOBOMA OF IRIS: absence of a part of the iris typically inferonasal part Option: C. CORECTOPIA: It refers to abnormally eccentric placed pupils. Normally pupil is placed slightly nasally to the centre. Option: D. POLYCORIA: In this condition, there is more than one pupil.</p>\n<p></p>",

The given case history and findings point towards the diagnosis of Sclerocornea Sclerocornea is a congenital anomaly of the eye in which the cornea blends with the sclera, having no clear-cut boundary.

A few congenital conditions in which corneal transparency is disturbed are as given below: Anterior embryotoxic. It is characterized by congenitally broad limbus superiorly. Posterior embryotoxic. It refers to the thickening and anterior displacement of Schwalbe's Line. Congenital corneal opacity. Corneal opacity, i.e. scarring of corneal stroma, is often an acquired condition but has been reported to occur congenitally in isolation and also in association with Lowe's syndrome, Axenfeld's anomaly, Rieger's syndrome, and Peter's anomaly. Sclerocornea refers to a sclera-like cloudy cornea, which may be peripheral or diffuse. Dermoids usually occur at the inferotemporal limbus and are round, dome-shaped, and pink to white to yellow in color. Rarely the dermoids may involve a large area of the cornea, the entire limbus, the entire cornea, or even the interior of the eye. Differential diagnosis of neonatal/cloudy cornea . The acronym 'STUMPED' helps to remember the common conditions to be included in the differential diagnosis of the neonatal cloudy cornea.
