It was first used on humans in Germany in 1980. Different methods of generating shock waves include spark gap, electromagnetic, piezoelectric and micro-expulsive. Shockwaves generated using the spark-gap method need to be coordinated with the patient\u2019s electrocardiogram (ECG) to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. Stones can be localised for treatment using either fluoroscopy or USS. This is the common form of treatment these days for renal calculi and stones up to approximately 1.5 cm in size are suitable for this form of treatment. More than one treatment session maybe needed to fully treat the stone, especially if it is sizeable. Prophylactic antibiotics are used to prevent infection as stones are often colonised by bacteria. Cystine stones are relatively resistant to ESWL due to their hardness. In addition to infection, ESWL may result in haematuria, parenchymal haemorrhage and even perirenal haematoma.

It was first used on a human in Germany in 1980. Different methods of generating shock waves include spark gap, electromagnetic, piezoelectric and micro-expulsive. Shockwaves generated using the spark-gap method need to be coordinated with the patient\u2019s electrocardiogram (ECG) to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. Stones can be localised for treatment using either fluoroscopy or USS. This is the common form of treatment these days for renal calculi and stones up to approximately 1.5 cm in size are suitable for this form of treatment. More than one treatment session may be needed to fully treat the stone, especially if it is sizeable. Prophylactic antibiotics are used to prevent infection as stones are often colonised by bacteria. Cystine stones are relatively resistant to ESWL due to their hardness. In addition to infection, ESWL may result in haematuria, parenchymal haemorrhage and even perirenal haematoma. A collection of stone fragments in a ureter after ESWL for a significant renal stone is given the German name of steinstrasse (\u2018street of stones\u2019).
