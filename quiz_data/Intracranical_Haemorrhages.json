      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Subdural hemorrhage Subdural hemorrhage is more common than extradural hemorrhage. It is common in childhood or old age. This occurs in the subdural space between the dura mater and the arachnoid due to the rupture of parasagittal bridging or communicating veins near the sagittal sinus. These veins are commonly ruptured when the brain moves across the face of the dura. Subdural hemorrhage may occur from relatively slight trauma, often insufficient to cause unconsciousness and usually not producing fractures of the skull, and may be associated with contrecoup contusions. About 70% occur due to falls and assaults and 25% due to vehicle accidents and are especially likely to be found in alcoholics, old persons owing to atrophy or shrinkage of the brain and in children. It may occur in the absence of a fracture of the skull or cerebral contusions or other visible brain It occurs after the head impacts a hard surface and the brain is accelerated, which causes the tearing of the parasagittal bridging veins.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option B, C, & D.

During the assault the victim is physically and emotionally active, due to which the levels of catecholamines increase, and the high blood pressure may cause the rupture of a weak aneurysm. A hard blow to the head may rupture a Beny aneurysm. A leaking aneurysm may cause behavioral abnormality leading to conflict with another person, an accident or a fall, and rupture of the Option: B. Causes : Rupture of bridging veins near the sagittal sinus. Focal hemorrhages result from force applied to the head, usually accompanied by shaking of the brain and its coverings within the skull. Lacerations and contusions of the brain and the Rupture of a saccular Berry aneurysm, which accounts for 95% of aneurysms that rupture. In 20 to 30 %of cases, multiple Berry aneurysms rupture. Option: D. In acute alcoholism, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is more common due to loss of muscular coordination, resulting in excessive rotational forces within the head, and also possibly due to increased bleeding from congested vessels which do not contract down, and the bounding pulse of the drunken man. This is the most common form of traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. In all cases of significant brain injury, some degree of subarachnoid hemorrhage is found. It may be the only complication of head injury but is often seen in association with other intracranial hemorrhages, brain injuries, and skull fractures</p>\n<p></p>",
