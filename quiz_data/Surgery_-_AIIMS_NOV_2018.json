If it is dilated, it suggests significant bowel obstruction, whereas if it is collapsed, it signifies small bowel obstruction.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Radiological features of obstruction (on plain x-ray) The obstructed small bowel is characterized by straight segments that are generally central and lie transversely. No/ minimal gas is seen in the colon The jejunum is characterized by its valvulae conniventes , which pass entirely across the width of the bowel and are regularly spaced, giving a \u2018Concertina\u2019 or ladder effect Ileum \u2013Wangensteen has piquantly described the distal ileum as featureless Caecum \u2013 a distended caecum is shown by a rounded gas shadow in the right iliac fossa Large bowel , except for the caecum, shows haustral folds , which, unlike valvule conniventes, are spaced irregularly, do not cross the whole diameter of the bowel and do not have indentations placed opposite one another Features of obstruction: In high small bowel obstruction, vomiting occurs early, is profuse and causes rapid dehydration. Distension is minimal with little evidence of dilated small bowel loops on abdominal radiography In low small bowel obstruction; pain is predominant with central distension. Vomiting is delayed. Multiple dilated small bowel loops are seen on radiography In significant bowel obstruction, distension is pronounced. Pain is less severe, and vomiting and dehydration are later features. The colon is proximal to the obstruction and is distended on abdominal radiography. The small bowel will be dilated if the ileocaecal valve is incompetent Small bowel obstruction predominantly has bilious vomiting, whereas it is rare in the large bowel.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Large bowel obstruction (LBO) can be classified as dynamic (mechanical) or adynamic (pseudo-obstruction). Mechanical obstruction occurs due to blockage of the large bowel, resulting in increased intestinal contractility. Conversely, pseudo-obstruction is characterized by the absence of intestinal contractility, often associated with decreased or absent motility of the small bowel and stomach. Colorectal cancer is the most common cause of LBO , with rectal cancer being more common than sigmoid. Adhesions , which are the most common cause of small bowel obstruction. are rarely a cause of colonic obstruction. In LBO , the colon becomes distended as gas, stool, and liquid accumulate proximal to the site of the blockage. Vascular compromise of the obstructed colon can occur due to excessive enlargement, leading to necrosis and perforation. Clinical features of LBO include failure to pass stool and flatus associated with increasing abdominal distention and cramping abdominal pain. An abdominal X-ray can reveal a distended colon , while a CT scan can help reveal an inflammatory process such as diverticulitis. A water-soluble contrast enema can diagnose suspected cases of volvulus or distal sigmoid cancer. Virtually all patients with complete acute large bowel obstruction require prompt surgical intervention and should not undergo a trial of non-operative management. Acute large bowel obstruction in patients with a competent ileocecal valve is a true surgical emergency because of the high chances of perforation, with the cecum being the most common site. Once the diagnosis has been made, surgical exploration should be undertaken as soon as possible after appropriate resuscitation</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Clock wise method Clock wise method/ dial of clock method involves palpating the breast segmentally with the pads of the middle three fingers (index, middle, and ring) held in a slightly bowed position. The breast is examined as if it were a \"dial of the clock,\" with the highest point at the upper edge of the breast just below the mid-clavicular point (12 o'clock) and the lowest point at the infra-mammary crease (6 o'clock). Palpation begins at 12 o'clock from the periphery of the breast towards the nipple by describing small circles of approximately 3 cm in diameter. Circular movements of the fingers' pads are made, increasing the pressure without lifting the fingers. The next circle is palpated towards the nipple, overlapping with the previous circle to about half its diameter. Once the areola and nipple area is reached, the next segment/sector is palpated at 1 o'clock. The inner half of the mammary gland is palpated while the patient is in a supine position. The patient is then asked to roll over onto the opposite side to palpate the outer half of the mammary gland. This allows the mammary tissue to fall towards the midline by gravity, resulting in a flattening of the lateral half of the mammary gland, making a lump in the lateral half more discernible.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Causes of discrete breast lumps Benign Malignant Non- inflammatory Fibroadenoma Carcinoma of the breast (invasive, DCIS) Ductal papilloma Phyllodes Hamartoma Galactocele Breast cyst Haematoma Traumatic fat necrosis Inflammatory Breast abscess (acute inflammatory, tubercular) Antibioma Periductal mastitis (evanescent mass) \u25cf      Granulomatous mastitis \u25cf      Parasitic: hydatid, filariasis \u25cf      Fungal: aspergillosis, blastomycosis, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options A: The vertical strip method involves palpating the breast in a vertical strip pattern from the clavicle to the bra line.

In some cases, breast cancer can cause symptoms that indicate the possibility of metastasis , such as difficulty breathing, bone pain, symptoms of hypercalcemia, abdominal distention, and jaundice . Other features of breast cancer include multifocality , which is the presence of second cancer in the same quadrant, within 4 cm, and multicentricity , which is the presence of second cancer outside the quadrant of the primary cancer, away at least 4 cm. Dimpling and puckering of the skin over the breast are caused by infiltration of the ligament of Cooper by the carcinoma. In rare cases, breast cancer can cause cancer en-cuirasse , which is the infiltration of the breast skin and chest wall with multiple nodules and ulceration by the carcinoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Discharges from the nipple Discharge from a single duct Bloodstained Intraduct papilloma Intraduct carcinoma Duct ectasia Serous (sticky translucent fluid) Duct papilloma Ductal hyperplasia Duct ectasia Ductal carcinoma (in situ and invasive) Discharge from more than one duct Bloodstained Carcinoma Duct ectasia Black, green or muddy Duct ectasia Purulent Periductal mastitis Milk Lactation Galactorrhoea Rare causes: hypothyroidism, pituitary tumour Discharge from the surface (not from within nipple) Paget's disease Skin diseases (eczema, psoriasis) Rare causes (e.g. chancre)</p>\n<p></p>",
