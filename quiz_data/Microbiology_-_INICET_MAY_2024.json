Approximately 5\u201340% of women are vaginal or rectal carriers of group B Streptococcus (GBS). Hence, the GBS infection is common in neonates and in pregnancy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Group B Streptococcus is a major cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Infections in pregnancy can lead to peripartum fever, endometritis and puerperal sepsis. Infections in adults generally involve elderly or people with underlying chronic illness, such as diabetes mellitus or malignancy. Common infections are cellulitis and soft tissue infections (including infected diabetic skin ulcers), UTI, pneumonia and endocarditis. Lab diagnosis: Isolation of GBS from blood culture and CSF culture are the mainstay of diagnosis. GBS is catalase negative like all streptococci, colonies of GBS are b-hemolytic, mucoid CAMP test positive and bacitracin resistant. Species identification can be confirmed by Lancefield sero grouping and automations such as MALDI-TOF. Treatment: Penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamicin are the drug of choice for all GBS infections.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Pharyngitis with or without tonsillitis is commonly caused by group A Streptococcus. Option: C & D. Dental caries and Endocarditis are commonly associated with viridans Streptococci like S matans. S agalactiae is not commonly implicated in dental caries.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Statement 1 is true and statement 2 is false Pathogenesis of diphtheria is toxin mediated. Diphtheria is a toxemia but never a bacteremia. Bacilli are noninvasive, present only at local sites (pharynx), secrete the toxin which spreads via bloodstream to various organs. Faucial diphtheria: Diphtheria toxin elicits an inflammatory response, that leads to necrosis of the epithelium and exudate formation This leads to formation of mucosal ulcers, lined by a tough leathery greyish white pseudomembrane coat; composed of an inner band of fibrin surrounded by neutrophils, RBCs and bacteria. Extension of pseudomembrane: In severe cases, it may extend into the larynx and bronchial airways, which may result in fatal airway obstruction leading to asphyxia. This mandates immediate tracheostomy. Polyneuropathy and myocarditis are the late toxic manifestations of diphtheria, occurring after weeks of infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Corynebacterium diphtheriae Morphology: Gram stain Positive. Some cells stain unevenly, giving a beaded appearance. Pleomorphic rods. They may be straight or slightly curved with tapered and sometimes clubbed ends. Cells are usually arranged singly or in pairs, often in a \"V\" formation or in palisades of several parallel cells. Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the pathogenic bacterium that causes diphtheria. It is also known as the Klebs-L\u00f6ffler bacillus, because it was discovered in 1884 by German bacteriologists Edwin Klebs and Friedrich Loeffler. Pathogenesis of Diphtheria is toxin mediated. Diphtheria is toxemia but never a bacteremia Bacilli are noninvasive, present only at local site (pharynx), secrete the toxin which spreads via bloodstream to various organs It is the toxin which is responsible for all types of manifestations including local (respiratory) and systemic complications (except the skin lesions, which is caused due to the organism, not toxin). Park William 8 strain of C. diphtheriae is used as a source of toxin for the preparation of vaccine LF unit: DT is expressed as Limit of flocculation (Lf) unit. 1 Lf unit is the amount of toxin which flocculates most rapidly with one unit of antitoxin. Occasionally, weakness, dysphagia, headache, and voice change are the initial manifestations. Neck edema and difficulty breathing are seen in more advanced cases and carry a poor prognosis. The systemic manifestations of diphtheria stem from the effects of diphtheria toxin and include weakness as a result of neurotoxicity and cardiac arrhythmias or congestive heart failure due to myocarditis. The pseudomembranous lesion is most often located in the tonsillopharyngeal region. The diphtheritic pseudomembrane is gray or whitish and sharply demarcated. Pseudomembrane in diphtheria is tightly adherent to the underlying tissues. Less commonly, the lesions are detected in the larynx, nares, and trachea or bronchial passages. Large pseudomembranes are associated with severe disease and a poor prognosis. A few patients develop swelling of the tonsils and present with \u201cbull-neck\u201d diphtheria, which results from massive edema of the submandibular and paratracheal region and is further characterized by foul breath, thick speech, and stridorous breathing. Unlike the exudative lesion associated with streptococcal pharyngitis, the pseudomembrane in diphtheria is tightly adherent to the underlying tissues. Clinical Features: The Clinical diagnosis of diphtheria is based on: Constellation of sore throat Adherent tonsillar, pharyngeal, or nasal pseudomembranous lesions Low-grade fever Respiratory diphtheria is the most common form of diphtheria. Tonsil and pharynx (faucial diphtheria) are the most common sites followed by nose and larynx. Diagnosis: Attempts to dislodge the membrane may cause bleeding. Hoarseness suggests laryngeal diphtheria, in which laryngoscopy may be diagnostically helpful. In addition, diagnosis requires the isolation of C. diphtheria or the histopathologic isolation of compatible gram positive organisms.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A, B & D. These are incorrect combinations as explained above.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The production of diphtheria toxin is dependent on various factors. Phage coded: DT is coded by a bacteriophage called \u03b2-corynephage, carrying tox gene. C. diphtheriae remains toxigenic as long as the phages are present inside the bacilli (lysogenic conversion) Iron concentration: The toxin production depends on the optimum concentration of iron (0.1 mg per liter) Other species: DT is also produced by C. ulcerans and C. pseudotuberculosis</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Mechanism of Diphtheria Toxin (DT) Fragment A is the active fragment, which causes ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2) \u2192 leads to inhibition of EF-2 \u2192 leads to inhibition of translation step of protein synthesis Exotoxin A of Pseudomonas has a similar mechanism like that of DT.</p>\n<p></p>",
