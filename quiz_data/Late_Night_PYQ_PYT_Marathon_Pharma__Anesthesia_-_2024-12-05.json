CO2 embolism : During laparoscopic procedures, CO2 is used to insufflate the abdomen, creating a pneumoperitoneum. This allows for better visualization and manipulation of the internal structures. If there's a vascular injury, especially to a large vein, CO2 can enter the circulation and cause an embolism. This can lead to sudden cardiovascular collapse and a sharp drop in EtCO2, as observed in the scenario. Also, a sudden drop in oxygen saturation (SpO2) can occur due to the embolism obstructing the pulmonary vasculature. The significant drop in EtCO2, in this case, is indicative of a CO2 embolism.</li><li>\u2022 1. CO2 embolism</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 2. Severe bronchospasm : Bronchospasm would lead to an increase in peak airway pressure, which wasn't seen in this scenario (the peak airway pressure was 18 cm of H2O, which is within the normal range). Moreover, EtCO2 would generally be elevated in bronchospasm due to retention of CO2, not decreased as seen in the scenario.</li><li>\u2022 2. Severe bronchospasm</li><li>\u2022 3. Pneumothorax : A pneumothorax could cause a drop in SpO2 and blood pressure. However, the EtCO2 drop to 8 mm Hg in the setting of laparoscopic surgery more specifically suggests a CO2 embolism. Additionally, one would expect an increase in peak airway pressures with a tension pneumothorax.</li><li>\u2022 3. Pneumothorax</li><li>\u2022 4. Single bronchus intubation : If the endotracheal tube is advanced too far and intubates a single bronchus, it would lead to ventilation of one lung only.
