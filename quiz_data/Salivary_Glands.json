      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1,2 and 4 only Radical parotidectomy involves the removal of all parotid gland tissue & elective division of the facial nerve , usually through the main trunk The surgery inevitably removes the ipsilateral masseter muscle and may also require simultaneous neck dissection Parotidectomy The removal of the parotid tumour along with a cuff of normal surrounding tissue where possible. Types : Extracapsular Adequate Superficial Total Conservative Radical Radical parotidectomy : It is performed for patients in whom there is clear histological evidence of a high-grade malignant tumour (e.g., SCC) with the invasion of the facial nerve. Low-grade and low-stage malignant tumours can usually be managed by standard superficial parotidectomy. Radical parotidectomy involves the removal of all parotid gland tissue & elective division of the facial nerve, usually through the main trunk. The surgery inevitably removes the ipsilateral masseter muscle and may also require simultaneous neck dissection, particularly where there is clinical, radiological and cytological evidence of lymph node metastases in the ipsilateral neck. When indicated, facial nerves can be repaired using cable grafts (inter-positional greater auricular or sural nerve grafts). Complications of Parotid Gland Surgery Haematoma formation Infection Deformity: unsightly scar and retromandibular hollowing Temporary facial nerve weakness Transection of the facial nerve and permanent facial weakness Sialocele Facial numbness Permanent numbness of the ear lobe associated with great auricular nerve transection Frey\u2019s syndrome</p>\n<p></p>",
