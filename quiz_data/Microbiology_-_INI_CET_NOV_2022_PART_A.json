Multiple lesions occur on the skin and mucous membranes, with a predilection for the trunk and anogenital areas . Individual lesions are firm, pruritic, pink to skin-colored umbilicated papules . A curd-like material can be expressed from the central umbilication. Smearing this material onto a glass slide and Giemsa staining shows diagnostic molluscum bodies , which are ellipsoid, homogeneous, cytoplasmic inclusions that are found in the cells of the stratum granulosum and the stratum corneum and are up to 35 um in size.

Donovan bodies are minute, encapsulated coccobacilli in macrophages, which can be demonstrated in Giemsa-stained smears of the exudate. Option B : Multinucleated giant cells (called Tzanck cells) are seen in herpes simplex virus infections. They are formed when individual epidermal cells containing viral inclusions fuse to produce giant cells. These can be demonstrated by the diagnostic Tzanck test Option D : Koilocytes are characteristically seen in HPV infections. Koilocytes are lining cells that have perinuclear cytoplasmic vacuolization.</p>\n<p></p>",

TH1 cells - activate macrophages by the classical pathway by secreting IFNy TH2 cells - recruit and activate eosinophils and are responsible for the alternative pathway of macrophage activation by secreting IL4, IL5, and IL13 IL4 acts on B cells to stimulate class switching to lgE and promotes the development of additional TH2 cells.

A few other parasites: Sarcocystis</p>\n<p></p>",

Roseola infantum, also known as exanthema subitum or sixth disease, typically presents in children between six and 12 months of age Patients with the virus classically present with acute onset high-grade fever up to 40 degrees celsius (104 degrees fahrenheit) lasting between three and five days. After that, rapid defervescence of the fever is accompanied by a nonpruritic, pink papular rash that begins on the trunk. Clinically diagnosed, self-limited illness that can be treated symptomatically The causative agents of Zika, Kyasanur Forest disease, and West Nile fever belong to the Flaviviridae group of viruses, which are known to cause hemorrhagic fever and present with petechial rashes.</p>\n<p></p>",

It can be subclinical or may present as a mild influenza-like illness. Encephalitis occurs in severe forms. Reverse-transcriptase PC has been used to identify the virus Hendra virus is endemic to Australia , and mostly affects horses. Ebola virus belongs to the genus Filovirus. It causes hemorrhagic fever. It is endemic to Africa . Yellow feve r is mostly confined to South and Central America , and certain parts of Africa. It is caused by flavivirus. It is an arthropod-borne hemorrhagic fever.
