      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. B) Trigeminal nerve</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The corneal reflex (also known as the blink reflex) is a protective mechanism that causes involuntary blinking when the cornea is touched. This reflex involves both sensory and motor components. During a corneal wisp test, a cotton wisp or similar object is brought in from the side (to avoid eliciting a visual reflex) and gently touches the cornea.</li><li>\u2022 The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) serves as the afferent (sensory) pathway for this reflex. Specifically, the ophthalmic division (V1) of the trigeminal nerve carries the sensory information from the cornea when it is stimulated. The sensory information is then processed, and an efferent (motor) response is generated via the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), which innervates the orbicularis oculi muscle, resulting in the blink.</li><li>\u2022 The corneal sensitivity can be tested more precisely using an instrument called an aesthesiometer, which measures the minimal stimulus required to elicit the blink reflex. Corneal sensation is characteristically decreased in viral corneal ulcers, making this test diagnostically valuable.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Oculomotor nerve : Incorrect. The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) is responsible for most eye movements by controlling four of the six extraocular muscles (superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, and inferior oblique). It also innervates the levator palpebrae superioris muscle (responsible for eyelid elevation) and carries parasympathetic fibers that control pupillary constriction and lens accommodation. It has no role in corneal sensation or the blink reflex pathway.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Oculomotor nerve</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Abducens nerve : Incorrect. The abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) innervates the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for abduction of the eye (moving the eye outward, away from the nose). It has no sensory function and does not participate in the corneal reflex pathway.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Abducens nerve</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Facial nerve : Incorrect, but partially involved in the reflex arc. While the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) is involved in the corneal reflex, it serves as the efferent (motor) pathway, not the afferent pathway. The facial nerve innervates the orbicularis oculi muscle, which causes the eyelid to close during blinking. The question specifically asks about the nerve responsible for \"eliciting\" the reflex, which refers to the sensory component (trigeminal nerve), not the motor response.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
