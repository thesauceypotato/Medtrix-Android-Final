      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Gluteus medius and minimus Gluteus medius and minimus prevent the tilting of pelvis on the unsupported side Gluteus medius and minimus supplied by superior gluteal nerves. Trendelenburg's sign occurs in people with weak or paralyzed hip abductor muscles (gluteus medius gluteus minimus) . The sign is demonstrated by asking the patient to stand on one limb. The pelvis severely drops over the swinging limb when the patient stands on the affected limb. Positive signs are typically found in patients with damage to the superior gluteal nerve . Damage to this nerve may occur with associated pelvic fractures, with space-occupying lesions within the pelvis extending into the greater sciatic foramen, and in some cases relating to hip surgery during which there has been disruption of and subsequent atrophy of the insertion of the gluteus medius gluteus minimus tendons on the greater trochanter. In patients with a positive Trendelenburg's sign, gait is abnormal. Typically during the stance phase of the affected limb, the weakened abductor muscles allow the pelvis to tilt inferiorly over the swing limb. The patient compensates for the pelvic drop by lurching the trunk to the affected side to maintain the level of the pelvis throughout the gait cycle.</p>\n<p></p>",
