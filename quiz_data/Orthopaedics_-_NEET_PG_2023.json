The lesions consist of a bony mass, often in the form of a stalk, produced  by endochondral ossification of a growing  cartilaginous cap. They are usually painless. The common sites of involvement are the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus. The following is an x-ray image of the knee  showing osteochondroma of the distal knee. Option D: : Aneurysmal bone cyst is a tumor that affects all age groups but generally occurs more commonly in adolescents with  an equal male: female distribution. It usually occurs in the metaphysis of long bones(like femur and tibia) and the posterior elements of vertebral bodies. Patients usually present with pain and swelling. Radiographically is seen as an eccentric, expansile, lytic Lesion with well-defined margins.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Fibrous dysplasia The above X ray shows the bending of the feature known as shepherd\u2019s crook deformity. It is seen in fibrous dysplasia of proximal femur. Fibrous dysplasia is a condition that affects bone development and is characterized by the replacement of the bone with fibrous tissue. The patient presents with a progressive limb deformit or a fracture through a previously asymptomatic lesion. The presentation often occurs in the second decade. Other symptoms include Non-Specific bone pain,tenderness and swelling in the affected area. The commonly involved sites are proximal femur,tibia,pelvis and foot. Polystotic fibrous dysplasia is associated with Albright -Mccune syndrome. Radiological findings include: Well defined,expansile intramedullary lesions. Hazy ground glass appearance is seen in the majority of the cases. Shepherd\u2019s crook deformity: Expansion with marked varus in the proximal femur</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A : Non-ossifying fibroma is the commonest variant of giant cell bone tumors. It is a benign, non-neoplastic lesion most commonly seen in the metaphyses of the long bones in children. Non-ossifying fibromas are usually asymptomatic, and often discovered incidentally on X-rays performed for other reasons. They commonly occur in the metaphyses of long bones and are characterized by well-defined, eccentric, cortically-based lytic lesions. The X-ray findings in the question do not match this description. Option C: Paget's disease of the bone is a condition where there is an increased bone turnover followed by enlargement and thickening of the bone. In this condition, calcium levels are normal with raised ALP. Paget's disease typically presents in older adults and affects the axial skeleton, including the pelvis, spine, skull, and femur. It is characterized by increased bone turnover, leading to disorganized bone remodeling, resulting in enlarged and deformed bones. The X-ray findings and the patient's age do not match the characteristics of Paget's disease. Option D: Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disorder characterized by increased bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures. It is associated with blue sclera, dental fragility, and hearing loss. It presents with the hallmark features of osteoporosis with increased fragility of bones along with blue sclera, dental fragility as well as hearing loss. The X-ray findings in the question do not show the characteristic features of osteogenesis imperfecta, such as thin cortices, multiple fractures, or wormian bones.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA CLASSICAL RADIOLOGICAL APPEARANCE OF BONE TUMORS RADIOLOGICAL APPEARANCE TUMORS SUNRAY APPEARANCE/CODMAN\u2019S TRIANGLE OSTEOSARCOMA ONION PEEL APPEARANCE EWING\u2019S SARCOMA SOAP BUBBLE APPEARANCE GIANT CELL TUMOR,ADAMANTINOMA GROUND GLASS APPEARANCE/SEPHERD\u2019S CROOK DEFORMITY FIBROUS DYSPLASIA PATCHY CALCIFICATION CHONDROGENIC TUMOR POPCORN,PUNCTATE OR COMMA SHAPED CHONDROSARCOMA STIPPLED OR PUNCTATE CALCIFICATION CHONDROBLASTOMA HOMOGENOUS CALCIFICATION OSTEOGENIC TUMOR FALLEN FRAGMENT SIGN SIMPLE BONE CYST DOUBLE DENSITY FLUID LEVELS AND INTRALESIONAL SEPTATION ANEURYSMAL BONE CYST WINKING OWL SIGN VERTEBRAL METASTASIS POLKA DOT SIGN VERTEBRAL HEMANGIOMA MOTH EATEN BONE MULTIPLE MYELOMA</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Vitamin D The given pediatric radiographic depicts the bowing of legs,which ANSWER : OPTION B: The given pediatric radiograph depicts the bowing of legs,which occurs due to rickets that results  from the deficiency of Vitamin D. Deficiency of vitamin D and calcium results in poor mineralization of bone,leading to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Rickets presents with skeletal changes like bowing of legs and bone pain once the child starts to walk. Radiological features show cupping at metaphysis,fraying and widening of the growth plate. Prominent costochondral joints(rachitic rosary) ,craniotabes,frontal bossing,scoliosis,fractures and dental anomalies maybe seen. The only cutaneous manifestation of vitamin D deficiency is alopecia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Clinical Manifestations Earliest manifestation is seen in skull Craniotabes is a softening of the cranial bones and can be detected by applying pressure at the occiput or over the parietal bones. The sensation is similar to the feel of pressing into a ping-pong ball and then releasing. Craniotabes may also be secondary to osteogenesis imperfecta, hydrocephalus, and syphilis. It is a normal finding in many new born, especially near the suture lines, but it typically disappears within a few months of birth. B. Chest Widening of the costochondral junctions results in a rachitic rosary, which feels like the beads of a rosary as the examiner's fingers move along the costochondral junctions from rib to rib. Growth plate widening is also responsible for the enlargement at the wrists and ankles. The horizontal depression along the lower anterior chest known as Harrison groove occurs from pulling of the softened ribs by the diaphragm during inspiration. Softening of the ribs also impairs air movement and predisposes patients to atelectasis and pneumonia. Short stature & bowing of long bones, with genu valgum, coxa vara or windswept deformities of legs (combination of valgus deformity of one leg with varus deformity of the other leg). Generalized muscular weakness, lethargy arid irritability, listlessness, tetany or convulsions. Protuberant abdomen with separation of recti muscles (muscular flaccidity) Large head, open fontanelles & craniotabes (box shaped head) Thickening of knees, ankle, & wrists physeal overgrowth (enlargement). Pectus carinatum i.e. forward projection of sternum i.Delayed dentition with irregular soft decaying teeth (enamel defect). Pale skin, flabby subcutaneous tissue & typical widened look. V.Radiographic Findings The characteristic features of rickets are Thickening & widening of growth plate (physis) Indistinct and hazy metaphysis that is abnormally wide with cupping or flaring. (Brush like appearance) Bowing of diaphysis, with thinning of cortices. Looser's zone can be seen in 15-20%</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTIONS A,C and D is not the correct answer.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Bipartite patella X-ray bilateral knee The given X-Ray shows a patella with a smooth discontinuity suggestive of an unfused accessory ossification center. Since this should arouse the suspicion of a bipartite patella, appropriate management would take an X-Ray of the other knee. A bipartite patella (two-part patella) is a patella with an unfused accessory ossification centre, typically at the superolateral aspect. It usually is asymptomatic and is noted incidentally,however pain, when present, can be caused by overuse (such as in a cyclist or climber). There are three types of bipartite patella Type I (5%) occurs at the inferior pole Type ll (20%) occurs along the entire border of the patella Type lI (75%) the most common type Occurs as an elliptical area in the superolateral portion of the patella Depending on the number of fragments may be classified as bipartite, tripartite or  multipartite. For diagnosis, a conventional  skyline view is followed by a skyline view the patient in a squatting weight-bearing posture than in the standard skyline view,the test result is considered positive. MRI is not required to diagnose the condition. If pain occur with a bipartite patella,limiting and restricting activity that is causing an overuse syndrome and prescribing nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents can result in improvement in 3 weeks. Operative treatment with the Ogata technique is rarely necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- A,C and D not the correct options.</p>\n<p></p>",
