      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Bowman\u2019s space Podocytes are specialized cells that are found in Bowman's capsule of the kidney and are important for the filtration function of the glomerulus.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Glomerular anatomy The glomerulus is a small network of blood vessels located within the renal corpuscle of the kidney. It consists of a tuft of capillaries that are surrounded by Bowman's capsule , which is a double-walled cup-like structure. The afferent arteriole brings blood into the glomerulus, while the efferent arteriole carries blood away from it. The glomerular capillaries are fenestrated , meaning they have small pores or holes that allow for the filtration of blood plasma. The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is a thin layer of extracellular matrix that lies between the capillaries and Bowman's capsule. It acts as a filtration barrier that prevents the passage of large molecules, such as proteins, into the urine. The visceral layer of Bowman's capsule is composed of specialized cells called podocytes , which wrap around the capillaries and form foot-like projections known as pedicels. The pedicels interdigitate with each other, leaving narrow filtration slits between them that are also part of the filtration barrier. The mesangium is a matrix of cells and extracellular material that supports the glomerular capillaries and plays a role in regulating blood flow through the capillaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. PCT: (proximal convoluted tubule) is a tubular structure of the nephron that is responsible for the reabsorption of ions, water, and nutrients from the glomerular filtrate. Option: B. DCT:(distal convoluted tubule) is another tubular structure of the nephron that is responsible for the reabsorption and secretion of ions and water. Option: C. Collecting tubules: CT of the kidney are responsible for the reabsorption of water and electrolytes from the urine and the excretion of waste products.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Slit diaphragm It is a specialized structure in the podocyte foot processes of the glomerulus that plays a critical role in the filtration barrier of the kidney. The integrity of the slit diaphragm is maintained by several proteins, including: Nephrin : It is a transmembrane protein that forms a homodimer and is a key component of the slit diaphragm. Podocin : It is a membrane protein that interacts with nephrin and stabilizes the slit diaphragm. CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) : It is a cytoplasmic protein that binds to nephrin and podocin and is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Actin : It is a cytoskeletal protein that provides structural support to the foot processes and is essential for maintaining the integrity of the slit diaphragm. \u03b1-Actinin-4: It is a cytoskeletal protein that crosslinks actin filaments and stabilizes the slit diaphragm.</p>\n<p></p>",
