She visits her physician, who feels the symptoms are consistent with a mild case of arthritis, and he prescribes symptomatic relief. Although this treatment initially helps, she soon finds that her knee becomes more swollen, erythematous, and warm. At another visit, her physician aspirates the knee and orders a Gram stain and culture of the fluid. When the laboratory reports these tests as negative, her physician prescribes a course of steroids. These provided symptomatic relief, but at the conclusion of the treatment, the swelling, erythema, and pain return. Another 3 months have passed, and the physician decides to admit her to the hospital. Additional fluid is collected for stains and culture.
