      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>High-level injury- less severe claw hand If the ulnar nerve is injured at the elbow, the clawing of the fingers is less, because the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus (flexor of proximal and distal interphalangeal joints) also gets paralyzed. If the ulnar nerve is injured at the wrist, the clawing of the fingers is more as intact flexor digitorum profundus flexes the digits more. Thus if the lesion is proximal (near the elbow), clawing is less.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>On the contrary, if the lesion is distal (near the wrist), clawing is more. This is termed an \u2018 action of paradox \u2019/ ulnar paradox. So according to the above explanation Option A and Option D, both can be correct but the best answer to the Ulnar paradox condition will be High-level injury- less severe claw hand.</p>\n<p></p>",

Abductor digiti minimi The deep branch of the Ulnar nerve supplies most of the intrinsic muscles of the hand. At first, it supplies three muscles of hypothenar eminence , ( Abductor digiti minimi muscle, Flexor digiti minimi brevis muscle, and Opponens digiti minimi muscles). Running in the concavity of deep palmar arch, it gives branches to 4th and 3rd lumbricals from the deep aspect and also innervates dorsal interossei and palmar interossei muscles and ends by giving innervation to Adductor pollicis muscle. Since it supplies most of the intrinsic muscles of the hand responsible for finer movements, this nerve is called the \u2018musician\u2019s nerve\u2019. Option: D. Opponens pollicis Both abductor pollicis and Opponens pollicis are muscles of thenar eminences and are supplied by the median nerve mainly.</p>\n<p></p>",
