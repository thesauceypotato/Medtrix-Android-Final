Schindylesis \u2013 Sphenovomerine vomero-sphenoidal Joint This fibrous suture joint can be found between the vomer and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone and between the vomer and the gap between the maxilla and palatine. Option: C. Syndesmosis: Bones are connected by interosseous ligaments or membranes. A syndesmosis is a slightly mobile fibrous joint in which bones such as the tibia and fibula are joined together by connective tissue. An example is the distal tibiofibular joint.

Compared to a male pelvis, a female pelvis shows the following differences. The false pelvis is deep in males and shallow in females. The pelvic inlet is heart-shaped in males due to jutting forwards of the sacral promontory. In females, it is transversely oval. The pelvic cavity is smaller and deeper in males. In females, the pelvic cavity is roomier and shallower, i.e. distance between the inlet and outlet is shorter. The pelvic outlet is smaller, with ischial tuberosities turned inside in males. In females, the pelvic outlet is bigger with everted ischial tuberosities. Sacrum is longer and narrow in males, while it is shorter and wider in females. The subpubic angle is narrower, i.e. 50\u00b0-70\u00b0 in males. The angle is wider, i.e. 80-90\u00b0 in females. This is the most important difference (Figs 15.14a and b). The greater sciatic notch is wider in females (75%) than in males (50\u00b0). The acetabulum is large in males, and its diameter is approximately equal to the distance from its anterior margin to the pubic symphysis.
