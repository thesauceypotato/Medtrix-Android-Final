These organisms produce the characteristic sporangium seen in the photograph. These opportunistic fungi readily invade blood vessels, entering tissues and producing necrotic lesions. Infection with these organisms is rapidly progressive, with a high mortality rate despite appropriate treatment. The most common predisposing factor for this infection is diabetic ketoacidosis. Other predisposing conditions include persons with acidosis due to other causes such as renal failure or diarrhoea. Patients with solid organ transplants, haematological malignancies, or corticosteroid therapy are also at risk.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Rhinocerebral Mycosis In Diabetes</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B and D.

In those people with a weakened immune system, damaged lungs or with allergies, Aspergillus can cause disease. Fungal infections of the nose and paranasal sinuses are uncommon, and the disease they cause can be identified from their histopathologic appearance. Aspergillus flavus was the most common isolate. Surgical debridement and sinus ventilation were adequate for the effective management of the non-invasive disease. However, adjuvant medical therapy was included in the treatment of the semi-invasive and invasive varieties of the disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B.
