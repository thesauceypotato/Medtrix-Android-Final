      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Spectroscopic test The spectroscopic test is the most specific for blood stains. It is the most delicate and reliable test for detecting the presence of blood in both recent and old stains. Less than 0.1 mg. of blood is sufficient. The blood stain is dissolved in water, normal saline, or dilute ammonia and placed in a small glass test tube, which is then kept between the spectroscope and the light source. The blood extract must be diluted,d and if turbid, it should be filtered. The solution of the blood absorbs some of the rays from the spectrum, producing characteristic dark absorption bands that vary with the type of blood pigment present.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A.
