      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Sebaceous cell Ca Chalazion, also called a tarsal or meibomian cyst, is a chronic non-infective (non-suppurative) lipo granulomatous inflammation of the meibomian gland. This is the commonest of all lid lumps. Aetiology Predisposing factors are similar to hordeolum externum. Pathogenesis - Usually, first, there occurs mild-grade infection of the meibomian gland by organisms of very low virulence. As a result, there occurs proliferation of the epithelium and infiltration of the walls of the ducts, which are blocked. Consequently, there occurs retention of secretions (sebum) in the gland, causing its enlargement. The pent-up and extravasated secretions (fatty in nature) act like an irritant and excite non-infective lipo granulomatous inflammation of the blocked meibomian glands and surrounding tissue.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Clinical features Symptoms include: Painless swelling Mild heaviness in the lid. Blurred vision may occur occasionally due to induced astigmatism by a very large chalazion pressing on the cornea. Watering (epiphora) may occur sometimes due to the eversion of the lower punctum. Signs include: Nodule Reddish purple area, A projection of the main bulk of the swelling on the skin side may be seen Marginal chalazion, occurring occasionally, may present as a small reddish-grey nodule on the lid margin.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: D. BCC is the most common human malignancy and typically affects older individuals. The most important risk factors are fair skin, inability to tan and chronic exposure to sunlight. Ninety per cent of cases occur in the head and neck and about 10 percent of these involve the eyelid. BCC is by far the most common malignant eyelid tumour , accounting for 90 per cent of all cases. It most frequently arises from the lower eyelid, followed in relative frequency by the medial canthus, upper eyelid and lateral canthus. Option: A. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a much less common, but typically more aggressive tumour than BCC, with metastasis to regional lymph nodes in about 20 percent of cases. Histopathology shows dysplastic changes throughout the thickness of the epidermis. Careful surveillance of regional lymph nodes is therefore an important aspect of initial management. The tumour may also exhibit perineural spread to the intracranial cavity via the orbit . Option: C. Melanoma rarely develops on the eyelids but is potentially lethal . Although pigmentation is a hallmark of skin melanomas , half of lid melanomas are non-pigmented and this may give rise to diagnostic difficulty.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Clinical course and complications Complete spontaneous resolution may occur rarely. The slow increase in size Fungating mass of granulation tissue may be formed occasionally when the lesion bursts on the conjunctival side.

Ninety per cent of cases occur in the head and neck and about 10 percent of these involve the eyelid. BCC is by far the most common malignant eyelid tumour , accounting for 90 per cent of all cases. It most frequently arises from the lower eyelid, followed in relative frequency by the medial canthus, upper eyelid and lateral canthus. Option: C. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a much less common, but typically more aggressive tumour than BCC, with metastasis to regional lymph nodes in about 20 percent of cases. Histopathology shows dysplastic changes throughout the thickness of the epidermis. Careful surveillance of regional lymph nodes is therefore an important aspect of initial management. The tumour may also exhibit perineural spread to the intracranial cavity via the orbit .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Nodular melanoma is typically a blue-black nodule surrounded by normal skin. Treatment is usually by wide excision and may include local lymph node removal.</p>\n<p></p>",

They are characterized by small papules that are often multiple and bilateral. Option: B Congenital naevi are uncommon and histologically resemble their acquired counterparts. They are usually small and of uniform colour. Rare variants include kissing or split naevus that involves the upper and lower eyelid and may occasionally contain numerous hairs. Option: C. Xanthelasma is a common, frequently bilateral condition typically affecting middle-aged and elderly individuals. Hyperlipidaemia is found in about one-third of patients, in whom corneal arcus may also be present. In contrast to a chalazion, fat in xanthelasma is mainly intracellular, with lipid-laden histiocytes (foam cells) in the dermis .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Xanthelasma are yellowish subcutaneous plaques, usually in the medial aspects of the eyelids, commonly bilateral and are multiple.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Recurrence occurs in up to 50 per cent and is most common in patients with hypercholesterolaemia.
