This condition manifests with emotional or behavioral symptoms, including depressed mood, anxiety, irritability, worry, and a sense of inability to cope. These symptoms often cause some degree of disturbance in the individual\u2019s daily functioning but are not severe enough to meet the criteria for major depression or other mental disorders. Symptoms usually develop within three months of the onset of the stressor and typically remit within six months if the stressor has ended or the individual adapts. The treatment of choice is supportive psychotherapy, which helps the patient develop coping strategies and adapt to the stressor.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Major depressive disorder : Major depressive disorder requires at least two weeks of pervasive depressive symptoms such as significant anhedonia, changes in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness, which are not present in this patient. His mood improves temporarily with social activities, suggesting a situational, rather than pervasive, emotional response.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Major depressive disorder</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Brief psychotic disorder : Brief psychotic disorder involves the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech, typically lasting less than a month. This diagnosis is not applicable here as the patient\u2019s symptoms are related to mood and stress rather than psychosis.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Brief psychotic disorder</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Persistent complex bereavement disorder : This condition involves intense and prolonged grief following the death of a loved one, characterized by severe yearning and difficulty moving on. It is not relevant in this case since the patient\u2019s stressor is a divorce rather than a bereavement, and his symptoms reflect an adjustment rather than pathological grief.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

The primary treatment approach is supportive psychotherapy, which aims to help individuals cope with the stressor and improve their functioning</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

During a recent session, she became visibly distressed while recounting a painful repressed memory from her past, expressing intense emotions she had not shown before. After the session, she reported feeling a sense of relief and release, stating that it was the first time she had openly confronted those emotions.

This emotional discharge can be therapeutic, as it allows the individual to confront and process deeply buried feelings that have been impacting their mental health.

Delirium typically presents abruptly and is marked by a rapid change in mental status, disorganized thinking, and perceptual disturbances like hallucinations. Consciousness is often clouded, and there may be marked diurnal variations with worsening symptoms at night (sundowning).

Gradual onset of symptoms and normal sleep-wake cycle : These features are more characteristic of dementia, particularly Alzheimer\u2019s disease, where cognitive decline occurs slowly over months to years, and the sleep-wake cycle remains relatively normal until late stages.

Persistent memory loss and normal orientation in early stages</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Stable alertness and absence of visual hallucinations : Delirium is frequently associated with visual hallucinations and fluctuating alertness, while dementia patients usually maintain stable alertness without significant hallucinations, particularly in the early and middle stages of the disease.
