Several centuries later, Galen described sepsis as a laudable event required for wound healing. According to germ theory, sepsis was recast as a systemic infection referred to as \u201cblood poisoning\u201d and was thought to be due to pathogen invasion and spread in the bloodstream of the host. Since then, the explanation of sepsis has changed a lot, as has the pathogenesis. Which is not true about pathogenesis of sepsis?",

Respiratory compromise classically manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), defined as hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates of non- cardiac origin that arise within 7 days of the suspected infection. ARDS can be classified by Berlin criteria as mild (PaO./FO, 201-300 mmHg), moderate (101-200 mmHg), or severe (s100 mmHg). A common com- peting diagnosis is hydrostatic edema secondary to cardiac failure or volume overload. Although traditionally identified by elevated pulmo- nary capillary wedge measurements from a pulmonary artery catheter (>18 mmHg), cardiac failure can be objectively evaluated on the basis of clinical judgment or focused echocardiography. Cardiovascular compromise typically presents as hypotension. The cause can be frank hypovolemia, maldistribution of blood flow and intravascular volume due to diffuse capillary leakage, reduced sys- temic vascular resistance, or depressed myocardial function. After ade- quate volume expansion, hypotension frequently persists, requiring the use of vasopressors. In early shock, when volume status is reduced, systemic vascular resistance may be quite high with low cardiac out- put after volume repletion, however, this picture may rapidly change to low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output. Cardiovascular compromise typically presents as hypotension. The cause can be frank hypovolemia, maldistribution of blood flow and intravascular volume due to diffuse capillary leakage, reduced systemic vascular resistance, or depressed myocardial function. Option B -Acute kidney injury (AKI) is documented in >50% of septic patients, increasing the risk of in-hospital death by six- to eightfold. AKI manifests as oliguria, azotemia, and rising serum creatinine levels and frequently requires dialysis. Option D - Many other abnormalities occur in sepsis, including ileus, elevated aminotransferase levels, altered glycemic control, thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation, adrenal dysfunction, and sick euthyroid syndrome.</p>\n<p></p>",
