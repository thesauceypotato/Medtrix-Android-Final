      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>None of the above Outcomes of acute inflammation: Complete resolution is usually when the injury is limited or short-lived or when there has been little tissue destruction, and the damaged parenchymal cells can regenerate . Healing by connective tissue replacement (scarring or fibrosis) occurs after substantial tissue destruction when the inflammatory injury involves tissues incapable of regeneration or when there is abundant fibrin exudation in tissue or in serous cavities that cannot be adequately cleared . Progression of the response to chronic inflammation occurs when the acute inflammatory response cannot be resolved due to either the persistence of the injurious agent or some interference with the normal healing process.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Role of inflammatory mediators: Role of Mediators in Different Reactions of Inflammation Reaction of Inflammation Principal Mediators Vasodilation Increased vascular permeability Histamine and serotonin C3 a and C5 a (by liberating vasoactive amines from mast cells, other cells) Leukotrienes C 4 , D 4 , E 4 Chemotaxis, leukocyte recruitment and activation TNF, IL-I Chemokines C3 a , C5 a Leukotriene B 4 Fever IL-1, TNF Prostaglandins Pain Prostaglandins Bradykinin Substance P Tissue damage Lysosomal enzymes of leukocytes Reactive oxygen species IL-I, Interleukin-1; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

Different stimuli activate monocytes/macrophages to develop into functionally distinct populations. Classically activated macrophages are induced by microbial products and cytokines, particularly interferon-y (IFN-y). They phagocytose and destroy microbes and dead tissues and can potentiate inflammatory reactions. Alternatively activated macrophages are induced by other cytokines and are important in tissue repair and resolution of inflammation.
