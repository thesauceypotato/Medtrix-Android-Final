It is the most common congenital anomaly of kidneys. This has increased in people with chromosomal defects such as Turner\u2019s and Down\u2019s syndrome. Horseshoe kidney is a congenital anomaly of the formation of kidneys. The symptoms include frequent UTIs, periodic reexamination, nausea, foul-smelling urine, etc. The patient complains of pain on the left side of the abdomen because of the mild ischemia of the left side of the transverse and descending colon. This is because the ascent of the kidney to its normal position is interrupted by the inferior mesenteric artery (the isthmus of the horseshoe kidney is the blockage), and the street is compressed. This artery is responsible for the blood supply of the hindgut. Hence, it is the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

Pancreatitis may start suddenly and last for days, or it can occur over many years. It has many causes, including gallstones, heavy alcohol use, etc. The symptoms include upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Since the pain is elicited on the left side and MRI doesn\u2019t indicate it, the answer is wrong. Option: D. Annular pancreas is a congenital defect of the joining of the ventral and dorsal heads of the pancreas. The symptoms include early satiety and nausea due to duodenal atresia. Since the patient doesn\u2019t complain of these symptoms and there is no radiological evidence of the defect, it is the wrong answer.</p>\n<p></p>",
