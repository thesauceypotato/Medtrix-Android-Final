A rise in CPK levels occurs infrequently. Myopathy is the only serious reaction but is rare (< 1 per 1000). Few fatalities due to rhabdomyolysis are on record. Myopathy and liver injury are more common when nicotinic acid/gemfibrozil or CYP3A4 inhibitor\u2014ketoconazole/ erythromycin/cyclosporine/HIV protease inhibitor is given concurrently. Gemfibrozil inhibits the hepatic uptake of statins by the organic anion transporter OATP2 and should not be given with them. Fenofibrate interferes the least with statin uptake/metabolism and should be preferred for combining with them When statins are administered with niacin, the myopathy probably is caused by an enhanced inhibition of the skeletal muscle ubiquitin pathway (a Pharmacodynamic interaction) In 2016, the FDA withdrew approval for statin drug combinations containing fibrates or niacin The risk of myopathy due to statins is increased with niacin</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Very rarely, statins can cause life-threatening muscle damage called rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis can cause severe muscle pain, liver damage, kidney failure, and death.

The interaction with simvastatin seems mainly driven by CYP3A4 inhibition at the intestinal level, whereas the interaction with atorvastatin is more due to hepatic CYP3A4 inhibition.
