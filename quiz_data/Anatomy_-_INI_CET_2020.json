At rest, it lies between the base of the mandible and the third cervical vertebra. Unlike other bones, the hyoid is only distantly articulated to other bones by muscles or ligaments. It is the only bone in the human body that is not connected to any other bones nearby. The hyoid is anchored by muscles from the anterior, posterior and inferior directions, and aids in tongue movement and swallowing. The hyoid bone provides attachment to the muscles of the floor of the mouth and the tongue above, the larynx below, and the epiglottis and pharynx behind.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>B During deep inspiration the lower border of the lung reaches level B anteriorly. The lower border of the lung extends till the 6th rib in the midclavicular line, 8th rib in mid axillary line and 10th rib in mid scapular line. During quiet breathing, the diaphragm moves about 1.5 cm. During deep breathing; however, it moves by 6-10 cm thus extending up to the level of the 6th rib or 11th thoracic vertebra on the right side. On full expiration, it extends up to 4th costal cartilage anteriorly, posteriorly up to the 8th vertebra. This corresponds to a line dividing the liver in upper 1/3rd and middle 1/3rd marked as B in the given Image .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The diaphragm on the left side is generally lower than on the right side. The excursions of the diaphragm vary with position maximum in the supine position, lesser in an erect position, and least in sifting position.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Opponens pollicis Origin: trapezium and transverse carpal ligament. Insertion: Metacarpal bone of the thumb on its radial side. Innervation: Recurrent branch of the median nerve, also ulnar nerve. Actions: Flexion of the thumb's metacarpal at the first carpometacarpal joint, which aids in opposition of the thumb. Arterial supply: Superficial palmar arch.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Flexor pollicis brevis superficial head arises from the distal edge of the flexor retinaculum and the tubercle of the trapezium, the most lateral bone in the distal row of carpal bones. It passes along the radial side of the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus. The deeper (and medial) head \"varies in size and may be absent.\" It arises from the trapezoid and capitate bones on the floor of the carpal tunnel, as well as the ligaments of the distal carpal row. Both heads become tendinous and insert together into the radial side of the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb; at the junction between the tendinous heads there is a sesamoid bone</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Abductor pollicis longus is inserted on the side of the base. The first palmar interosseous muscle arises from the ulnar side of the base. Flexor pollicis brevis insert together into the radial side of the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb . Therefore Option A, B and D are incorrect answers.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The superficial head of flexor pollicis brevis is usually innervated by the lateral terminal branch of the median nerve.
