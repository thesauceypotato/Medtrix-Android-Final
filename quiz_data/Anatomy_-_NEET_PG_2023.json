Meckel's diverticulum Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. It results from incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct leading to the formation of a true diverticulum of the small intestine. Option C. Medial umbilical ligament The medial umbilical ligament (or cord of umbilical artery, or obliterated umbilical artery) is a paired structure found in human anatomy. It is on the deep surface of the anterior abdominal wall, and is covered by the medial umbilical folds (plicae umbilicales mediales). Option D. Lateral umbilical ligament The lateral umbilical fold is an elevation (on either side of the body) of the peritoneum lining the inner/posterior surface of the lower anterior abdominal wall formed by the underlying inferior epigastric artery and inferior epigastric vein which the peritoneum covers.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Urachal problems, also known as urachal abnormalities, occur when the urachus does not close normally during fetal development. This can cause issues such as: Urachal remnant: The channel does not close at all. If the channel is open from the umbilicus to the bladder, it is called a patient urachus.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Lateral pterygoid The lateral pterygoid muscle has an upper head and a lower head The upper head originates on the infratemporal surface and infratemporal crest of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. It inserts onto the articular disc and fibrous capsule of the temporomandibular joint. The lower head originates on the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate. It inserts onto the pterygoid fovea at the neck of the condyloid process of the mandible. Lateral Pterygoid muscle</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The lateral pterygoid muscle is supplied by pterygoid branches of the maxillary artery. The lateral pterygoid muscle is supplied by the lateral pterygoid nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve (CN V 3 ), itself a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Medial pterygoid The medial pterygoid muscle consists of two heads. The bulk of the muscle arises as a deep head from just above the medial surface of the lateral pterygoid plate. The smaller, superficial head originates from the maxillary tuberosity and the pyramidal process of the palatine bone. Its fibers pass downward, lateral, and posterior, and are inserted, by a strong tendinous lamina, into the lower and back part of the medial surface of the ramus and angle of the mandible, as high as the mandibular foramen. Option C. Masseter muscle Masseter muscle originates from zygomatic arch and maxillary process of zygomatic bone and inserts on angular surface of ramus of mandible bone and coronoid process of mandible bone. Option D. Temporalis muscle The temporalis muscle arises from the temporal fossa and the deep part of temporal fascia. It passes medially to the zygomatic arch. It forms a tendon which inserts onto the coronoid process of the mandible.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The primary function of the lateral pterygoid muscle is to pull the head of the condyle out of the mandibular fossa along the articular eminence to protrude the mandible. A concerted effort of the lateral pterygoid muscles helps in lowering the mandible and opening the jaw. Unilateral action of a lateral pterygoid muscle causes contralateral excursion (a form of mastication), usually performed in concert with the medial pterygoids.When they work independently, they can move the mandible side to side. Unlike the other three muscles of mastication, the lateral pterygoid alone can assist in depressing the mandible (opening the jaw). At the beginning of this action it is assisted by the digastric, mylohyoid and geniohyoid muscle.</p>\n<p></p>",

Caput succedaneum Caput succedaneum is swelling (edema) that affects a newborn\u2019s scalp. It most commonly occurs from pressure on the head as the baby moves through the birth canal during a prolonged or difficult vaginal delivery. In caput succedaneum , fluid builds underneath the scalp, causing swelling. The baby\u2019s head may have a cone-shaped appearance or newborn conehead . Option B. Encephalocele Encephalocele is a sac-like protrusion or projection of the brain and the membranes that cover it through an opening in the skull. Encephalocele happens when the neural tube does not close completely during pregnancy. Option D. Subgaleal hemorrhage Subgaleal hemorrhage (SGH) is an accumulation of blood in the space between the epicranial aponeurosis and the periosteum, caused by the rupture of the emissary veins.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The usual causes of a cephalohematoma are a prolonged second stage of labor or instrumental delivery, particularly forceps delivery. Ventouse application does not increase the incidence of cephalhematoma. Vitamin C deficiency has been reported to possibly be associated with development of cephalohematomas .</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Fascia Transversalis The deep or internal ring is located just above the midpoint of the inguinal ligament and lateral to the epigastric vessels. The deep ring is formed by the transversalis fascia which provides the posterior covering of the contents of the inguinal ring</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The inner surface of the abdominal muscles is lined by fascia which is separated from peritoneum by extra- peritoneal connective tissue. That part of the fascia which lines the inner surface of the transversus abdominis muscle is called the fascia transversalis . Opening of Deep Inguinal Ring About 1.2 cm above the mid inguinal point, there is an oval opening in the fascia transversalis. This opening is the deep inguinal ring. The ring lies immediately lateral to the inferior epigastric artery. It transmits the spermatic cord in males, and the round ligament of the uterus in females.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B.  Transverse abdominis The transversus abdominis muscle is the deepest of the 6 abdominal muscles.  It extends between the ribs and the pelvis, wrapping around the trunk from front to back. The fibers of this muscle run horizontally, similar to a back support belt. Option C. Peritoneum The peritoneum is the serous membrane that lines the abdominal cavity. It is composed of mesothelial cells that are supported by a thin layer of fibrous tissue and is embryologically derived from the mesoderm Option D. Internal oblique The abdominal internal oblique muscle , also internal oblique muscle , is an abdominal muscle in the abdominal wall that lies below the external oblique muscle and just above the transverse abdominal muscle.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The deep inguinal ring is an oval opening in the fascia transversalis, situated 1.2 cm above the mid inguinal point, and immediately lateral to the stem of the inferior epigastric artery. The superficial inguinal ring is a triangular gap in the external oblique aponeurosis. It is shaped like an obtuse angled triangle. The base of the triangle is formed by the pubic crest. The two sides of the triangle form the lateral or lower and the medial or upper margins of the opening. It is 2.5 cm long and 1.2 cm broad at the base. These margins are referred to as crura. At and beyond the apex of the triangle, the two crura are united by intercrural fibres</p>\n<p></p>",
