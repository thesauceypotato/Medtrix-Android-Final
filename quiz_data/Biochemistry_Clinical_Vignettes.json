She was given two exchange transfusions on her first day and phototherapy for 8 days. She was maintained with monthly red blood cell transfusions until a splenectomy was performed at age 3. From then on, transfusions were required only rarely, usually after infections. Her mental development was normal, physical development was delayed. She is now 13 years old. Investigating the metabolite concentrations in the erythrocytes of this patient (before the first transfusion) resulted in the following: high levels of glucose-6-phosphate, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, 3- phosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, ADP, and AMP and low levels of ATP, pyruvate, and lactate.1 Which of the following glycolytic enzymes is most likely defective?",
