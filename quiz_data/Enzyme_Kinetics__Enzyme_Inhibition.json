      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Xanthine Oxidase Suicide Inhibition aka mechanism-based inhibition: When the product of an enzyme inhibits its own enzyme activity. The term is mainly used for enzyme inhibitions by artificial inhibitors such as drugs to differentiate it from feedback inhibition. Suicide inhibition of enzyme Xanthine oxidase: Allopurinol first makes oxypurinol using XO which will then inhibits XO itself. It's like oxypurinol is suicidal i.e. it's inhibiting the enzyme responsible for its formation</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B: Lipoxygenase The lipoxygenases are dioxygenases that produce hydroperoxy derivatives from arachidonic acid known as hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids which can further give rise to inflammatory and hypersensitivity reaction mediators leukotrienes. Examples of 5-LOX inhibitors are pharmaceutical drugs meclofenamate sodium, zileuton, and the natural products myxochelins/pseudochelin Bioactive boswellic acids found in Boswellia serrata (Indian Frankincense) is an allosteric inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase. Option C: Phospholipase C PLC is an enzyme that is involved in the signal transduction pathway. It acts by hydrolysis of a membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), to generate two secondary messengers: inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) It is regulated by G-protein which in turn gets stimulated in response to an external stimulus such as hormones or a drug molecule, etc. Option D: Glucose oxidase It is a microbial enzyme not found in humans. It is widely used in blood glucose monitoring devices such as glucometer. It has an antimicrobial activity due to the production of H2O2 so used in food preservatives and wound treatment gels.</p>\n<p></p>",

K cat and K m are used as an estimate for the kinetic efficiency of enzymes, but either parameter alone is insufficient for this purpose. For instance, two enzymes catalyzing different reactions may have the same K cat (turnover number), yet the rates of the uncatalyzed reactions may be different and thus the rate enhancements brought about by the enzymes may differ greatly. Hence, the best way to compare the catalytic efficiencies of different enzymes is to compare their respective ratio of K cat /K m for a given reaction. The parameter, Kcat/Km is called the specificity constant. The greater the ratio, the higher the rate of catalysis is; conversely, the lower the ratio, the slower the rate of catalysis is.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B: Turnover number It is the maximum number of conversions that a single enzyme can perform per second for a given enzyme concentration.

Option C: K m Km of an enzyme is a substrate concentration at which velocity is equal to half of V So, it has the same unit as concentration i.e. millimoles L -1 Option D: K d /K m K d is a dissociation constant which gives a measure of how easily a complex of two or more compounds will dissociate into its components. In other words, it tells us the affinity between components of a system such as a ligand and its receptor. Higher K d means lower affinity and vice versa. Though K m gives you similar information, it is a little more complex and is specifically used for enzyme reactions that involve binding, catalysis, and dissociation rather than just binding and dissociation.</p>\n<p></p>",

Allosteric enzymes contain a site other than the active site known as the allosteric site where an allosteric regulator can bind ( option B is a true statement) . This causes a change in the enzyme activity usually by changing the active site conformation (see fig.). These regulators bind transiently by non-covalent interactions usually in response to a signal such as a hormone or covalent modification or a concentration change of regulator ( option D is a true statement) . After the signal is gone, the effector molecule gets detached and enzyme activity may change back to its original levels. Allosteric enzymes don\u2019t follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics.

Lesser value of Km for a substrate means a higher affinity of the enzyme for that substrate and vice versa. In other words, an enzyme with a low K m for a substrate can act on it even at its low physiological concentration, and an enzyme with a high Km for its substrate will only bind and catalyze when a high concentration of that substrate is available.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option A: Km is dependent on enzyme concentration. K m does not depend on enzyme concentration. So, i f enzyme concentration is doubled, the V max will be doubled. But the 1/2 V max will be achieved with the same substrate concentration which means K m will remain the same (Option A is false). Option C: Km value denotes the product concentration at half-maximal velocity As is shown in the graph, the Km value can be defined as the substrate concentration (expressed in moles/L) at which it achieves half-maximal velocity (option C is false). At this concentration half of enzyme, molecules are bound by substrate molecules. Option D: The Km value can be the same for two different enzymes Km value is constant for an enzyme also known as the signature of the enzyme. Even the isozymes which are  the same enzymes catalyzing the same reaction differing only in their amino acid sequence and 3-D structure will have different Km for the same substrate under the same conditions.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>B All of these graphs are Lineweaver Burk Plot or Double reciprocal Graph which are modified forms of Michaelis-Menten graph in which 1/[S] on the X-axis is plotted vs 1/V on the Y-axis. It is a straight-line graph instead of a hyperbolic shape with y-intercept gives 1/Vmax and x-intercept as 1/Km and slope as Km/Vmax. It is easy to read and interpret specially for determining the type of inhibition. For classic competitive inhibition:- The y- intercept is = 1/ V max , which indicates that when 1/[S] approaches 0 , then v i is independent of the presence of the inhibitor . The intercept on the x -axis does vary with inhibitor concentration , since \u20131/ K \u2032m is smaller than \u20131/ K m , So, K \u2032 m (the \u201capparent K m\u201d) becomes larger in the presence of increasing concentrations of the inhibitor. Thus, a competitive inhibitor has no effect on V max but raises K \u2032 m (apparent K m for the substrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B: For Uncompetitive inhibition As seen in the graph, \u20131/ K m decreases whereas 1/ V max increases which means V max decreases and K m increases in case of uncompetitive inhibition. Lineweaver-Burk plot for uncompetitive inhibition Option C: For non- competitive inhibition:- The y-intercept 1/ V max increases in the presence of an inhibitor indicating an apparent increase in V max . The intercept on the x -axis does not vary with inhibitor concentration and hence is independent of the presence of inhibitor , So, K m remains the same as with no inhibitor present. Thus, a competitive inhibitor has no effect on K m but decreases V max .</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>B has a higher Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) than A One can estimate the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) on this graph by taking the concentration of substrate at one-half of the enzyme's maximal velocity (V max ). When one does this, B has a higher Km than A (Option D is true) .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option A: A is the same enzyme as B but in the presence of a competitive inhibitor If A and B were the same enzyme with a competitive inhibitor added, at maximal substrate concentrations the V max of the two enzymes would become equal. Based on the graph, this is not the case. The V max of B is higher than A (Option A is false). Option B: B has a greater affinity for glucose than A Affinity is based on the K m of an enzyme. The lower the K m , the higher the affinity. Therefore, enzyme A has a greater affinity for glucose than enzyme B (Option B is false) . Option C: At maximal substrate concentrations, both enzymes display first-order kinetics At maximal concentrations, enzyme binding sites become saturated and the curves of both enzymes flatten and therefore become independent of substrate concentration, implying zero-order kinetics (Option C is false) . First-order kinetics is seen during the initial stages of low substrate concentration.</p>\n<p></p>",

Tests on her husband\u2019s sperm counts and her uterine sonogram plus clotting and hormone levels are all normal. However, the urine analysis is showing the presence of a reducing substance galactose. Suspecting galactosemia, the physician orders testing of the GALT, the enzyme responsible for classical galactosemia. The result shows a slightly low value for GALT activity but no previously known mutation. The physician recalls the occurrence of ovarian dysfunction in galactosemia and further consults a pathologist to measure the Km of the female\u2019s GALT to confirm that it is a defective enzyme and no other factors for low activity. The assay was conducted using 6 increasing amounts of UDP-galactose in a 1-minute reaction using the same amount of enzyme (E) for conversion to UDP-glucose. Which of the following analyses would be most useful for determining the Km?",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Plot of 1/ Vi versus 1/ S An assay for measurement of enzyme activity uses excess substrate and short assay time to ensure maximal reaction velocity also known as initial velocity ( V i) that is proportional to the amount of enzyme in a given tissue or fluid and gives the accurate measure of the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Plotting V i for increasing substrate concentrations gives a hyperbolic saturation curve that asymptotically approaches maximal reaction velocity ( V max) for that amount of enzyme. The measure of the substrate concentration S that gives half-maximal reaction velocity ( K m) requires estimation of V max from the asymptote (incorrect answer c) and is thus more accurate using the reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot of 1/ V i versus 1/ S (Fig. B) where 1/ V max is the intercept on the y-axis and \u22121/ K m, the intercept on the x-axis (eliminating answers a, d, and e). Mutations affecting enzyme conformation and/or its binding site with substrate alter the Km and reduce the reaction velocity at usual tissue substrate levels.
