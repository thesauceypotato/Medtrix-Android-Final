In the ABC test, the patient's bone conduction is compared with the examiner's (assuming the examiner has normal hearing). The patient and examiner's external auditory meatus should be occluded (by pressing the tragus inwards) to prevent ambient noise from entering through the AC route. In conductive deafness, the patient and the examiner hear the fork at the same time. In sensorineural deafness, the patient hears the fork for a shorter duration. Option D. In the Weber test, a vibrating tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead or the vertex and the patient is asked in which ear the sound is heard. Usually, it is heard equally in both ears. It is lateralised to the worse ear in conductive deafness and to the better ear in sensorineural deafness.</p>\n<p></p>",

This is functional hearing loss or pseudo-hypacusis, or Stenger test is used to detect malingering.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Stenger Test The principle involved is that if a tone of two intensities, one greater than the other, is delivered to two ears simultaneously. Only the ear which receives a tone of greater intensity will hear it. To do this test, take two tuning forks of equal frequency, strike them, and keep them 25 cm from each ear. The patient will claim to hear it in the normal ear. Now bring the tuning fork on the side of feigned deafness to within 8 cm, keeping the tuning fork on the normal side at the same distance. The patient will deny hearing anything even though the tuning fork on the normal side is where it could have been heard earlier.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Neural Deafness The tone decay test measures nerve fatigue ( neural deafness) and is used to detect retro cochlear lesions . A more than 25 dB decay is diagnostic of a retro cochlear lesion.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Method of doing the test and principle A continuous tone of 5 dB above the threshold in 500 Hz and 2000 Hz is given to the ear, and a person should be able to hear it for 60 sec. The result is expressed as dB, with which intensity must be increased so that the patient can hear the sound for 60 sec. If tone decay of >25 dB is present, it indicates retro-cochlear leison, e.g.-acoustic neuroma.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Absent on both sides Stapedial reflex : Mediated by the 7th ( efferent ) and 8th ( afferent ) nerve, It is a Bilateral reflex. 7th nerve palsy \u2013 reflex absent only on the side of the lesion. 8th nerve palsy \u2013 reflex absent on both sides.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Stapedial Reflex It is based on the fact that a loud sound, 70\u2013100 dB above the threshold of hearing of a particular ear, causes bilateral contraction of the stapedial muscles, which can be detected by tympanometry. Tone can be delivered to one ear, and the reflex is picked from the same or the contralateral ear. The reflex arc involved is Ipsilateral : CN VIII \u2192 ventral cochlear nucleus \u2192 CN VII nucleus ipsilateral stapedius muscle. Contralateral: CN VIII \u2192 ventral cochlear nucleus \u2192 contralateral medial superior olivary nucleus \u2192 contralateral CN VII nucleus \u2192 contralateral stapedius muscle.
