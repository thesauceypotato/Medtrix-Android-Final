Inflammation : ARDS is characterized by an inflammatory response in the lungs, which is indicated by the presence of neutrophils and macrophages in the alveoli and interstitial spaces. Edema : The alveolar-capillary barrier in the lungs becomes leaky in ARDS, leading to the accumulation of fluid in the alveoli and interstitial spaces, which is known as pulmonary edema. Alveolar damage : The histopathological features of ARDS include damage to the alveolar walls, leading to the collapse of the alveoli and impaired gas exchange in the lungs.
