Anti relapse treatment with a 14-day course of primaquine may be started concurrently. Artesunate plus Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine is given on 1st day, and from 2nd day artesunate plus primaquine.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Advantages of ACT over other antimalarials are: Rapid clinical and parasitological cure. High cure rates (>95%) and low recrudescence rate. Absence of parasite resistance (the components prevent development of resistance to each other). Good tolerability profile One orally available ACT includes a tablet with artemether coformulated with lumefantrine and is used for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Artesunate may be combined with sulfadoxine\u2013pyrimethamine, mefloquine, clindamycin, or others. The antimalarial action of artemisinin derivatives involves the production of free radicals resulting from cleavage of the drug\u2019s endoperoxide bridge by heme iron in the parasite food vacuole. Oral, rectal, IM and intravenous (IV) preparations are available, but the short half-lives preclude the use of these drugs for prophylaxis. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. High doses may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Hypersensitivity reactions and rash have occurred.

Malignant cells readily depend on suppression of the apoptotic pathway; therefore, proteasome inhibition works well in multiple myeloma. Bortezomib can be administered IV, but the subcutaneous route is preferred because it is associated with less neuropathy. Other adverse effects include myelosuppression, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and herpes zoster reactivation. Patients should receive antiviral prophylaxis if they are receiving therapy with bortezomib.

This drug produces minimal withdrawal symptoms when discontinued and has a low potential for overdose, a long duration of action, and the ability to block heroin effects, hence used for maintenance therapy in opium addiction.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Buprenorphine It is a synthetic thebaine congener, highly lipid-soluble \u00b5 analgesic that is 25 times more potent than morphine but with lower intrinsic activity and ceiling effect. Sedation, vomiting, miosis, subjective and cardiovascular effects are similar to morphine, but constipation is less marked. Postural hypotension is prominent. Naloxone (high dose) can prevent buprenorphine effect , but only partially reverses it when given afterwards. Naloxone does not precipitate buprenorphine withdrawal; probably because of more tight binding of buprenorphine to opioid receptors. Use: Buprenorphine is indicated for long lasting painful conditions requiring an opioid analgesic, e.g. cancer pain. It has also been recommended for premedication, postoperative pain, in myocardial infarction and in the treatment of morphine dependence as an alternative to methadone.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B. is incorrect as naloxone is used to treat overdose with other opioids and agonist-antagonists (except buprenorphine). Option: C. is incorrect as butorphanol is used for postoperative and other short-lasting (e.g. renal colic) painful conditions. Option: D. is incorrect as clonidine, an \u03b12 adrenergic agonist that decreases adrenergic neurotransmission from the locus ceruleus, and is used for opioid withdrawal but not for maintenance.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Opioid Withdrawal and Detoxification- The first stage of treatment addresses physical dependence and consists of detoxification. SYMPTOMS SIGNS Regular withdrawal Craving for opioids Restlessness, irritability Increased sensitivity to pain Nausea, cramps Muscle aches Dysphoric mood Insomnia, anxiety Pupillary dilation Sweating Piloerection (\"gooseflesh\") Tachycardia Vomiting, diarrhea Increased blood pressure Yawning Fever Protracted withdrawal Anxiety Insomnia Drug craving Cyclic changes in weight, pupil size, respiratory center sensitivity Transfer to a prescription opioid medication and then gradual dose reduction- short-acting opioid such as heroin to a long-acting one such as methadone. Use of oral clonidine, an \u03b12 adrenergic agonist that decreases adrenergic neurotransmission and is commonly used off label to reduce symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The techniques proposed include acupuncture and several methods of CNS activation using transcutaneous electrical stimulation. Long-Term Management Buprenorphine , a partial agonist at the MOR, represents a major change in the treatment of opiate addiction. Antagonist Treatment- Naltrexone is an antagonist with a high affinity for MOR; it will competitively block the effects of heroin or MOR agonists</p>\n<p></p>",
