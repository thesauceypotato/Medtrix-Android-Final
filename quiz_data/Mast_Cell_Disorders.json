Pathogenesis: Mast cell degranulation is triggered by immune (IgE mediated) and non-immune (cytokines, complement) mechanisms leading to the release of histamine which causes vasodilation. Features:- Wheals: caused by localized edema. Clearing of the central region may occur, and lesions may coalesce, producing an annular or polycyclic pattern. Subcutaneous swellings (angioedema) may or may not accompany the wheals. Site: Anywhere in the body</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Acute atopic dermatitis: It is a condition that causes dry, itchy, and inflamed skin. It's common in young children but can occur at any age. Option C .

Allergic contact dermatitis: It refers to a group of skin disorders in which the skin reaction is due to direct contact with the causative agent characterised by surface skin changes such as blistering, dryness, peeling, and redness.</p>\n<p></p>",
