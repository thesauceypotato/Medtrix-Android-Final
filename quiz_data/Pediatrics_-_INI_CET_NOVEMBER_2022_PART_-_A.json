Hand preference in the early years seems to rely on which hand is closer to the desired object; for example, a toddler may reach for a toy on their left side with their left hand because of convenience, regardless of future hand preference. Most children have a preference for using one hand or the other by the age of about 18 months, and are definitely right or left-handed by about the age of three</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Handedness development in children is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Most children establish a clear preference for using either their left or right hand by the age of 3 years. During the first year of life, infants tend to use both hands interchangeably. Around the age of 2 years, children may start showing slight hand preference, but it is not consistent. By the age of 3 years, there is a noticeable increase in hand preference. Children start consistently favoring either their left or right hand for activities like drawing, writing, and grasping objects. Some children may establish a clear preference earlier or later than the average age of 3 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A. 1 year: At this age, children haven't established hand preference yet.

This involves maintaining the patient's airway, administering supplemental oxygen, and addressing any respiratory distress or abnormalities. IV Lorazepam: The next step is to administer a benzodiazepine, such as IV lorazepam. Benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment for status epilepticus and work by enhancing the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain, thereby terminating the seizure activity. IV Fosphenytoin: If the seizure activity persists after the administration of a benzodiazepine, the next step is to administer a second-line antiepileptic drug (AED) like IV fosphenytoin. Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin and helps control ongoing seizure activity by stabilizing neuronal membranes and reducing excessive electrical activity in the brain. Midazolam, Propofol, Thiopentone: If the seizures continue despite the use of lorazepam and fosphenytoin, the next step involves initiating continuous IV infusion of antiepileptic medications, such as midazolam, propofol, or thiopentone. These medications are used for refractory status epilepticus and help to achieve and maintain seizure control.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

It is a generalized tonic-clonic type of seizure. Minor risk factors include a family history of epilepsy, male gender, daycare, complex febrile seizure, family history of febrile seizures, and lower serum sodium at the time of presentation. Lumbar puncture should be performed in the first episode of seizures with fever, for all infants <6 months of age (to exclude meningitis). Acute treatment of febrile seizures includes lorazepam and midazolam for seizures lasting more than 5 minutes. Rectal diazepam is prescribed to use at home as rescue medication if febrile seizures last more than 5 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Febrile seizures are typically associated with a rapid rise in body temperature, often caused by common childhood illnesses. While most febrile seizures are benign and resolve on their own, certain factors can increase the likelihood of recurrence Age < 1 year: Children younger than 1 year old have a higher risk of experiencing recurrent febrile seizures compared to older children. Temperature of 38-39 degrees Celsius : Febrile seizures are more likely to recur when the body temperature during the fever episode is within the range of 38-39 degrees Celsius.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>a, b Thalassemia is a hemoglobinopathy that arises due to deficient synthesis of the globin chains. Depending on the chain affected, it is classified into a-thalassemia and -thalassemia. B thalassaemia major is the homozygous state of B thalassaemia. B chain synthesis is absent or grossly reduced Anaemia & poor tissue oxygenation - increased EPO production - drives marrow erythropoiesis - increased ineffective marrow activity  resulting in bony deformities. Clinical features: Severe Anemia Growth and development retardation & irritability. Splenomegaly & Hepatomegaly. Bossing of skull, Prominent malar eminence, Depression of bridge of nose Hemosiderosis resulting in organ failure Investigation Peripheral smear : Microcytic, Hypochromic Anaemia, Target Cells & Nucleated Red Cells. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) - showing an increase in HbA2 and HbF levels Osmotic fragility test shows increased resistance to haemolysis. Helps in diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. Markedly reduced or absent Hb-A. Raised levels of haemoglobin F (>92%). Skull radiograph \u201cHair on end\" appearance Widening of medullary spaces MCV/RB count also known as the Mentzer index can be used to distinguish thalassemia trait from iron-deficiency anemia. A Mentzer index of more than 13 is suggestive of iron deficiency anemia while a value less than 13 points to the -thalassemia trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hemolytic facies, splenomegaly, and a history of recurrent blood transfusion suggest a hemolytic disorder in the child. The appropriate investigations for this patient include a peripheral blood smear and HPLC. A peripheral blood smear helps evaluate the morphology of blood cells and can reveal characteristic features of hemolytic anemias. HPLC is a specialized test that detects and quantifies abnormal hemoglobin variants, making it useful in diagnosing thalassemias. Bone marrow aspiration and PT/APTT may not be directly related to the evaluation of hemolytic disorders but may be included to assess hematological function and rule out other abnormalities.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Hemolytic facies refers to the facial features associated with chronic hemolysis, such as a pale or jaundiced appearance. Splenomegaly is the enlargement of the spleen, which can occur in various hemolytic disorders due to increased destruction of red blood cells. Recurrent blood transfusion suggests that the child has a chronic anemia requiring regular transfusions to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels. Peripheral blood smear is a simple and readily available test that allows the examination of blood cells under a microscope. It can reveal abnormalities in red blood cell morphology, such as the presence of spherocytes or schistocytes, which may indicate a hemolytic process.</p>\n<p></p>",
