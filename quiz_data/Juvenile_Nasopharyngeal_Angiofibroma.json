Tumour regresses slowly in about a year, sometimes up to 3 years. Radiotherapy is also used in intracranial extension of disease when the tumour derives its blood supply from the internal carotid system. Treatment with radiotherapy is controversial. Option: C. Chemotherapy for very aggressive recurrent tumours and residual lesions has been treated chemotherapy. Doxorubicin, vincristine and dacarbazine have been used in combination. Option: D. Since the tumour occurs in young males at puberty, probably activated by testosterone, hormonal therapy as the primary or adjunctive treatment has been used.

It was associated with occasional intermittent pain, which aggravated on bending. The patient had frequent epistaxis from the right nostril with a feeling of the stuffiness of the nose and nasal discharge. There was a history of extraction of the upper right second molar after the appearance of swelling. The extra-oral examination suggested a lobular swelling on the right side of the face extending from a pterygomaxillary fissure and spreading into the infratemporal and temporal fossa and appearing in the cheek. He was Diagnosed as a case of Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. What would be the direction of spread of the tumour that appeared in the cheek in this condition?",
