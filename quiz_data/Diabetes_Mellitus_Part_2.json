Age or treatment modality is not a criterion. Although type 1 DM most commonly develops before the age of 30, autoimmunity against beta cells can develop at any age. It is estimated that between 5 and 10% of individuals who develop DM after age 30 have type 1 dm. Although type 2 DM more typically develops with increasing age, it is now being diagnosed more frequently in children and young adults, particularly in obese adolescents. Option: B. it was used in earlier classification. The terms insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) are no longer used. Because many individuals with type 2 DM eventually require insulin treatment for control of glycemia, the use of the term NIDDM generated considerable confusion. Option: D. not the basis.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dawn Phenomenon There is reduced tissue sensitivity to insulin between 5:00 am to 8:00 am which leads to pre-breakfast hyperglycemia and is known as the dawn phenomenon This is found in 75 per cent of people with type one diabetes mellitus and can aggravate hyperglycemia . His is hence the correct answer</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A Somogyi effect This can be due to excess bedtime insulin This is triggering the release of counter-regulating hormones resulting in pre-breakfast hyperglycemia This is called a Somogyi phenomenon Option: C waning of insulin effect The waning of insulin phenomenon occurs if an evening dose is insufficient Blood glucose levels may creep up as you sleep With waning insulin, the rise in blood glucose is typically more gradual than with the dawn phenomenon Hence this option is excluded Option: D None of the above this option is false because the correct answer is Option: B- dawn phenomenon</p>\n<p></p>",
