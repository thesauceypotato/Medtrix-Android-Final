Intrauterine adhesions form due to trauma to the endometrium, commonly after repeated D&Cs.</li><li>\u2022 Hysteroscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing and treating Asherman syndrome. It provides a direct view of the uterine cavity, enabling precise identification of adhesions and simultaneous adhesiolysis (removal of adhesions). This approach helps restore the endometrial cavity\u2019s normal structure, improving the chances of conception and alleviating symptoms like hypomenorrhea.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Pelvic ultrasound: Pelvic ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging method commonly used to evaluate the uterus and adnexa for abnormalities like fibroids or ovarian cysts. However, it cannot provide direct visualization of adhesions or intrauterine scarring, making it suboptimal for diagnosing Asherman syndrome. The adhesions may not always alter the thickness of the endometrium in a way that is visible on an ultrasound, limiting its diagnostic accuracy in this scenario.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Pelvic ultrasound:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. MRI pelvis: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis provides detailed imaging of soft tissue structures and is effective in diagnosing complex uterine conditions like adenomyosis, fibroids, and congenital uterine anomalies. However, it is not typically the investigation of choice for evaluating suspected intrauterine adhesions, as it lacks the resolution needed to directly visualize intrauterine pathology and cannot be used for therapeutic purposes.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. MRI pelvis:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Saline infusion sonography: Saline infusion sonography (sonohysterography) involves instilling saline into the uterine cavity to enhance visualization of the endometrial lining and detect abnormalities such as polyps or adhesions. While this method can detect adhesions as filling defects, it cannot provide direct visualization or treatment of adhesions. Hysteroscopy remains superior because it allows both diagnosis and immediate treatment.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

There is trace edema in the right leg, and neurologic examination is unremarkable.
