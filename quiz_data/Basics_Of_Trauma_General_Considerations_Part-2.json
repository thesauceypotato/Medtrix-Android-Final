A compound fracture penetrates the skin. An open fracture, also called a compound fracture , is a fracture in which there is an open wound or break in the skin near the site of the broken bone. Most often, this wound is caused by a fragment of bone breaking through the skin at the moment of the injury. Option: C. Displaced fractures have nonaligned bone, and some deformity may result. A displaced fracture means the pieces of your bone moved so much that a gap formed around the fracture when your bone broke Option: D. An incomplete, or greenstick, fracture occurs when the bone cracks and bends but does not completely break; when the bone does break into separate pieces, the condition is called a complete fracture The bone remains contiguous with an incomplete fracture that does not extend completely across the shaft of the bone.</p>\n<p></p>",

Genu varum (also called bow-leggedness, bandiness, bandy-leg, and tibia vara) is a varus deformity marked by (outward) bowing at the knee, which means that the lower leg is angled inward (medially) about the thigh's axis, giving the limb overall the appearance of an archer's bow. Usually, medial angulation of both lower limb bones (femur and tibia) is involved. Option: B. Congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV), often known as 'club-foot', is a common but little-studied developmental disorder of the lower limb. It is defined as fixation of the foot in adduction, in supination, and in varus, i.e. inclined inwards, axially rotated outwards, and pointing downwards Option: D.
