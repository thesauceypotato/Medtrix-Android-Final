PBPs are enzymes that are involved in the last stages of assembling the bacterial cell wall and in reshaping the cell wall during growth and division. This inactivation results in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and eventually causes cell lysis Cilastatin is a chemical compound which inhibits the human enzyme dehydropeptidase.

It works\nby killing bacteria. Cilastatin is in a class of medications called\ndehydropeptidase inhibitors. It works by helping Imipenem stay active in your\nbody for a longer period of time. Antibiotics such as\nImipenem and Cilastatin injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral\ninfections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of\ngetting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.</p>\n<p></p>",
