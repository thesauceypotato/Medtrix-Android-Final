The actions of these muscles are affected when there is an injury to the superior gluteal nerve, neck of the femur, or loss of normal angulation of the shaft of the femur.

It is caused by the hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the Pylorus, which results in constriction and obstruction of the gastric outlet. First-born male infants are at the highest risk for developing CHPS. Projectile, non-bilious vomiting is a common symptom in infants with CHPS. A palpable olive-shaped mass is usually felt in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, and visible peristalsis can be observed moving from left to right, followed by projectile vomiting. Infants with CHPS develop a characteristic metabolic abnormality including hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria. Loss of hydrochloric acid leads to metabolic alkalosis and hypochloremia due to persistent vomiting. The kidneys try to compensate for alkalosis by secreting Na+ and HCO3, but the loss of sodium stimulates aldosterone secretion leading to the loss of potassium ions (hypokalemia). Loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH resulting in paradoxical aciduria. Treatment involves rehydration and correction of metabolic abnormalities before surgery, and the Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is the standard surgical procedure for CHPS.</li><li>\u27a4 CHPS (congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis) is most commonly seen in infants between 2 to 8 weeks of age.</li><li>\u27a4 It is caused by the hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the Pylorus, which results in constriction and obstruction of the gastric outlet.</li><li>\u27a4 First-born male infants are at the highest risk for developing CHPS.</li><li>\u27a4 Projectile, non-bilious vomiting is a common symptom in infants with CHPS.</li><li>\u27a4 A palpable olive-shaped mass is usually felt in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, and visible peristalsis can be observed moving from left to right, followed by projectile vomiting.</li><li>\u27a4 Infants with CHPS develop a characteristic metabolic abnormality including hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria.</li><li>\u27a4 Loss of hydrochloric acid leads to metabolic alkalosis and hypochloremia due to persistent vomiting.</li><li>\u27a4 The kidneys try to compensate for alkalosis by secreting Na+ and HCO3, but the loss of sodium stimulates aldosterone secretion leading to the loss of potassium ions (hypokalemia).</li><li>\u27a4 Loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH resulting in paradoxical aciduria.</li><li>\u27a4 Treatment involves rehydration and correction of metabolic abnormalities before surgery, and the Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is the standard surgical procedure for CHPS.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

The toxin inhibits the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine from presynaptic terminals in the central nervous system.
