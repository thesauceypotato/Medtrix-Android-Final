      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Autoimmune reaction against retinal antigens This patient has anterior uveitis, which typically manifests with bilateral eye pain and redness, photophobia, perilimbal congestion and hypopyon on slit-lamp examination. Sympathetic ophthalmia is an autoimmune reaction against retinal antigens that occurs days to years after a penetrating ocular injury or, less commonly, ocular surgery. Damage to the eye can sensitize the immune system to retinal antigens and subsequently cause bilateral granulomatous anterior uveitis. This manifests with bilateral eye pain, redness, and photophobia as seen in this case. Evidence of inflammation of the anterior chamber on slit lamp examination is typical. This patient is at risk of bilateral blindness; treatment with glucocorticoids should be initiated immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Sympathetic ophthalmia Etiology Predisposing factors: l. It almost always follows a penetrating injury . Wounds in the ciliary region ( the so-called dangerous zone) are more prone to it. Wounds with the incarceration of the iris, ciliary body or lens capsule are more vulnerable. It is more common in children than in adults. It does not occur when actual suppuration develops in the injured eye. Pathogenesis : Various theories have been put forward. The most accepted one is an allergic theory, which postulates that the uveal pigment acts as an allergen and excites plastic uveitis in the sound eye. Pathology It is characteristic of granulomatous uveitis, i.e. there is \u2022 Nodular aggregation of lymphocytes, plasma cells, epithelioid cells and giant cells scattered throughout the uveal tract. \u2022 Dalen-Fuchs' nodules are formed due to the proliferation of the pigment epithelium (of the iris, ciliary body and choroid) associated with invasion by the lymphocytes and epithelioid cells . \u2022 Sympathetic perivasculitis . The retina shows perivascular cellular infiltration. Clinical features Exciting (injured) eye. It shows clinical features of persistent low-grade plastic uveitis, which include ciliary congestion, lacrimation and tenderness. Keratic precipitates may be present at the back of the cornea ( dangerous sign ). Sympathizing (sound) eye. It is usually involved after 4-8 weeks of injury in the other eye . The earliest reported case is after 9 days of injury . Sympathetic ophthalmitis, almost always, manifests as acute plastic iridocyclitis . Rarely it may manifest as neuro retinitis or choroiditis. Clinical features of iridocyclitis in the sympathetic eye can be divided into two stages : Prodromal stage. Sensitivity to light (photophobia) and transient indistinctness of near objects (due to weakening of accommodation) are the earliest symptoms. In this stage, the first sign may be the presence of retrolental flare and cells or the presence of a few keratic precipitates (KPs) on the back of the cornea. Other signs include mild ciliary congestion, slight tenderness of the globe, fine vitreous haze and disc oedema which is seen occasionally. Fully-developed stage . It is clinically characterised by typical signs and symptoms consistent with acute plastic iridocyclitis</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A .Reactivation of herpes zoster virus within the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve causes herpes zoster ophthalmicus, which manifests with anterior uveitis as seen in this case. However, this condition typically causes unilateral symptoms, not bilateral symptoms. Moreover, this patient lacks additional manifestations of herpes zoster ophthalmicus such as cutaneous symptoms (e.g., vesicular rash) and fever. Option: C .Infection of the cornea with aeruginosa causes bacterial keratitis, which manifests with blurry vision, eye pain, and redness as seen in this case. In addition, this patient's contact lens use is a significant risk factor for this condition. However, the absence of purulent discharge and corneal ulcers on slit-lamp examination makes this diagnosis unlikely. Moreover, bacterial keratitis rarely manifests with bilateral anterior uveitis. Option : D. Impaired drainage of aqueous humour can cause angle-closure glaucoma, which manifests with sudden-onset blurry vision, eye pain, and redness as seen in this case. However, this condition typically causes unilateral symptoms, not bilateral symptoms, and does not typically cause hypopyon. Moreover, this patient lacks additional manifestations of angle-closure glaucoma such as frontal headaches, nausea, and vomiting.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Genetic predisposition to the development of sympathetic ophthalmia has also been proposed, with a particular focus on human leukocyte antigen (HLA). HLA-A11 antigen expression has been linked to patients with sympathetic ophthalmia, as well as HLA-DRB1*04, DQA1*03, and DQB1*04. Interestingly, similar associations have been recognized between HLA-D4, DQw3, and -DRw43 and VKH disease. (source:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679835/)</p>\n<p></p>",

Leprosy ( Hansen's disease ) is caused by Mycobacterium leprae which is an acid-fast bacillus . The disease occurs in two principal forms: LEPROTIC UVEITIS Acute iritis. It is caused by antigen-antibody deposition and is characterised by severe exudative reactions. Chronic granulomatous iritis. It occurs due to direct organismal invasion and is characterised by the presence of small glistening 'iris pearls' near the pupillary margin in a necklace form ; small pearls enlarge and coalesce to form large pearls. Rarely, a nodular lepromatous may be seen. Treatment Besides the usual local therapy of iridocyclitis , antileprotic treatment with Dapsone 50-100 mg daily or other drugs should also be instituted.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A . Candida endophthalmitis is characterised by areas of severe retinal necrosis associated with vitreoretinal abscesses. Vitreous exudates present as \u2018puff ball\u2019 or \u2018cotton ball\u2019 colonies, which when joined by exudative strands form a \u2018 string of pearls\u2019 . Option: B . After cataract - Elschnig\u2019s pearls in which the vacuolated subcapsular epithelial cells are clustered like soap bubbles along the posterior capsule . Option: C. Sq cell carcinoma of the eyelid \u2013 Histological features. It is characterised by an irregular downward proliferation of epidermal cells into the dermis. In well-differentiated form, the malignant cells have a whorled arrangement forming epithelial pearls which may contain laminated keratin material in the centre</p>\n<p></p>",
