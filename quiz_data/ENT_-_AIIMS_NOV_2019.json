Instead it causes apparent conductive hearing loss.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome is a set of hearing and balance symptoms, related to a rare medical condition of the inner ear, known as superior canal dehiscence. The symptoms are caused by a thinning or complete absence of the part of the temporal bone overlying the superior semicircular canal of the vestibular system. Low-frequency conductive hearing loss is present in many patients with SCDS and is explained by the dehiscence acting as a \"third window.\" Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome/3rd window syndrome: disease of inner ear leading to Conductive Hearing Loss. Superior semicircular canal dehiscence creates a 3rd window \u2013when oval window goes in some part of energy is lost via 3rd window and leads to conductive hearing loss.
