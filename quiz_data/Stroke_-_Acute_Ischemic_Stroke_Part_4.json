For suspected strokes identified by prehospital professionals, we encourage calling ahead to the destination hospital. This allows early \"stroke code\" activation to prepare for an emergent computed tomography (CT) on arrival. For patients with onset <6 h from the last time seen normal, we expedite a non-contrast head CT scan, and if free of haemorrhage and the patient is IV plasminogen activator (PA) eligible, this is administered in the CT scanner. (For IV tissue PA [tPA], the bolus is given and infusion initiated; for tenecteplase, the full dose is given as a bolus). Then CT angiography (CTA) from the left atrium to the skull vertex is performed to identify an eligible target lesion for thrombectomy. For a patient presenting in the 6- to 24-h time window, PA is not considered, and the decision to perform thrombectomy is based on perfusion imaging.</p>\n<p></p>",
