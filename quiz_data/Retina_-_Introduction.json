Photocoagulation to close the feeder vessels of neovascular fronds can cause regression of the neovascularization (NV) but is associated with a relatively high rate of complications (hemorrhage) . Scatter photocoagulation to the region involved with the NV can effectively control it with fewer complications.

Compared to macular laser treatment , the scatter photocoagulation technique is more extensive and of greater intensity. Panretinal photocoagulation involves the application of microscopic laser burns to the peripheral portions of the retina, not the macular region.

Option 3: Obliterating feeder vessels by retinal photocoagulation has been used to cause infarction of peripheral neovascular beds. This technique has effectively managed proliferative sickle retinopathy, especially in cases where neovascularization has persisted after extensive scatter photocoagulation treatment. The method has been proposed to decrease the incidence of Bruch membrane penetration , thereby decreasing the chance of choroidal neovascularization.
