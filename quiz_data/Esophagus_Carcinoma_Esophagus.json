      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The neoplastic proliferation of the squamous epithelium The neoplastic proliferation of squamous epithelium is the hallmark of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus , which can manifest with progressive dysphagia and halitosis due to food particles retained in the esophagus. The histopathology involves clusters of keratin pearls destroying normal tissue structure in the upper two-thirds of the esophagus. It typically affects patients with risk factors such as long-term alcohol use, tobacco exposure, achalasia, and diets low in fruits and vegetables.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Well-differentiated neoplastic glandular proliferation is associated with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus , which can manifest with progressive dysphagia and halitosis . A biopsy would, however, not show clusters of keratin pearls but rather high-grade dysplasia of columnar epithelium with adjacent Barrett esophagus . In addition, adenocarcinoma typically involves the lower third rather than the middle of the esophagus. Option: B. Atrophy and fibrosis of the oesophagal smooth muscle can be seen in CREST syndrome or systemic sclerosis . These diagnoses may manifest with dysphagia and halitosis in severe oesophagal However, biopsy findings would not show keratinisation but fibroblast proliferation and smooth muscle atrophy . Moreover, patients with either condition typically present with findings such as sclerodactyly and the Raynaud phenomenon . Option: C. Metaplastic transformation of oesophagal mucosa is seen in Barrett's esophagus , which can manifest with halitosis , as seen in this patient. However, a biopsy would not show the keratin pearls seen here. Instead, it would typically show an extension of the physiologic transformation zone as oesophagal squamous epithelium is replaced with intestinal-type columnar epithelium with goblet cells. Non-dysplastic Barret's oesophagus. The yellow arrow indicates goblet-cell-positive mucosa adjacent to the squamocolumnar junction.</p>\n<p></p>",

The typical presenting symptoms of esophageal cancer are dysphagia and significant weight loss . Dysphagia is typically fairly rapidly progressive over weeks to months. Dysphagia initially is only to solid foods but progresses to include semisolids and liquids. Weight loss occurs due to decreased oral intake in addition to cachexia, which is common with cancer. The two major cell types of esophageal cancer are adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma , which have different risk factors.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Esophageal cancer is the 8th most common cancer and the 6th most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are the most common types of esophageal cancer. The incidence of esophageal cancer is higher in areas of high incidence than in the rest of the world. Aetiological factors vary between the two main types of esophageal cancer. Genetic predisposition may be important in the pathogenesis of esophageal squamous cell cancer. Dietary and environmental factors are essential in developing squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with other aerodigestive malignancies are at particularly high risk.

Various causative factors have been implicated in the development of squamous cell cancers of the esophagus; the etiology of such cancers is primarily related to excess alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking. The relative risk increases with the amount of tobacco smoked or alcohol consumed, with these factors acting synergistically. Squamous cell esophageal carcinoma has also been associated with ingesting nitrates and smoked opiates, as well as mucosal damage caused by such physical insults as long-term exposure to extremely hot tea, the ingestion of lye, radiation-induced strictures, and chronic achalasia. The presence of an esophageal web in association with glossitis and iron deficiency (i.e., Plummer-Vinson or Paterson-Kelly syndrome ) and congenital hyperkeratosis and pitting of the palms and soles have each been linked with squamous cell esophageal cancer, as have dietary deficiencies of molybdenum, zinc, selenium, and vitamin A.
