Asherman syndrome (intrauterine adhesions or intrauterine synechiae) occurs when scar tissue forms inside the uterus and/or the cervix. These adhesions occur after surgery of the uterus or after a dilatation and curettage with tuberculosis and schistosomiasis being a less common cause. It occurs when trauma to or removal of the basal layer of endometrium in opposing areas within the uterine cavity. Such injury to the lining triggers inflammation that allows these adhesive bands to form from one side of the cavity to the other. Mild disease: few filmy adhesions involving less than a third of the uterine cavity with normal menses or hypomenorrhea. Moderate disease: filmy and dense adhesions, the involvement of one-third to two-thirds of the cavity, and hypomenorrhea. Severe disease: dense adhesions involving more than two-thirds of the cavity with amenorrhea. Although dilatation and curettage (D&C) are the most frequently used intervention for removing retained products of conception(RPOC), hysteroscopic resection, in comparison, is associated with lower rates of intrauterine adhesion formation. Hysteroscopic resection gives the advantage of direct visualization of the uterine chamber, thus allowing the removal of RPOC with minimal damage to the endometrium.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options B, C and D are false.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Findings on ultrasound for which endometrial sampling is indicated include: A thickened endometrial lining greater than 4 mm. Diffuse or focally increased echogenicity or heterogeneity. The inability to visualize the endometrium adequately. Endometrial sampling should also be obtained in patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding, even in the setting of a thin endometrial echo.

Women may begin to feel the urge to bear down as the presenting part descends into the pelvis. However, they should be discouraged from bearing down until the cervix is fully dilated so that they do not tear the cervix or waste energy. During the 2nd stage of labour, perineal massage with lubricants and warm compresses can be used but precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of infection with a perineal massage. During the 2nd stage (in contrast to the 1st stage), the mother's position does not affect the duration or mode of delivery or maternal or neonatal outcome in deliveries without epidural anaesthesia. Also, the pushing technique (spontaneous versus directed and delayed versus immediate) does not affect the mode of delivery or maternal or neonatal outcome. Use of epidural anaesthesia delays pushing and may lengthen the 2nd stage by an hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options A, B and D are false.</p>\n<p></p>",
