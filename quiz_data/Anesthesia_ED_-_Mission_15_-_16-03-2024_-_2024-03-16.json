D) Reduce FiO\u2082</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The patient's oxygenation status is excellent with a PaO\u2082 of 110 mmHg and SpO\u2082 of 100% while on a high FiO\u2082 of 90%. Prolonged exposure to high FiO\u2082 levels increases the risk of oxygen toxicity and absorption atelectasis. Therefore, FiO\u2082 should be reduced below 60% once oxygenation is adequate. The elevated PaCO\u2082 (58 mmHg) with a near-normal pH (7.33) reflects compensated respiratory acidosis, which is acceptable in the context of lung-protective ventilation strategies. In ARDS, permissive hypercapnia is an accepted approach where mild-to-moderate CO\u2082 retention is tolerated to avoid volutrauma and barotrauma from high tidal volumes or aggressive ventilation. Thus, reducing FiO\u2082 is safer and more appropriate than increasing tidal volume.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
