Immune ring of wessely . Dry, rough looking ulcer with projecting ends called hyphae . Multiple small ulcers are  present away from the main ulcer called satellite lesions. Non sterile, immobile greyish white hypopyon is present because fungi can penetrate the anterior chamber without perforation. Note:- Ring abscess is a feature of acanthamoeba keratitis Immune ring of wessely is also seen in disciform keratitis( condition associated with viral infection) Treatment usually includes antifungal medications depending on sensitivity. Atropine eye drops are given to release ciliary spasms and to give symptomatic relief. Dexamethasone is contraindicated as it will cause immunological suppression and hence flaring of infection. Pilocarpine is not given as it will cause constriction of pupil and hence will aggravate pain. Lidocaine has no role and also it will cause reduced sensation and hence can aggravate complications. Signs Opacity in the cornea which will take up fluorescein stain as the epithelium will be abraded. Pupils will be constricted and sluggishly reactive due to irritation to the iris. This toxic reaction can produce hypopyon which will be sterile in bacterial ulcers. In fungal ulcer fungal hyphae may be present.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Stages Stage of progressive infiltration Stage of active ulceration Stage of regression Stage of cicatrization</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Endothelium possesses Na+/K+ ATPase , which keeps the corneal stroma in a relatively dehydrated state . This helps in maintaining the transparency of the cornea. Single layer of cells Endothelial cells decrease with ageing & any intraocular surgery. Normal specular count- 2500-3500/ mm3. The normal endothelium is usually made up of hexagonal , regular, cells which are roughly uniform in shape DESCEMET\u2019S MEMBRANE:- The Descemet\u2019s membrane is a strong homogenous basement membrane of the corneal endothelium which is separated from the stroma by the pre-Descemet's membrane. It is very resistant to chemical agents , trauma and pathological processes. EPITHELIUM:- It is of stratified squamous type and becomes continuous with epithelium of bulbar conjunctiva at the limbus. It consists of 5\u20136 layers of cells. Tight junctions between superficial epithelial cells prevent penetration of tear fluid into the stroma. STROMA:- Constitutes most of the cornea (90% of total thickness). It consists of collagen fibrils ( type-I and type-V fibrillae intertwined with filaments of type-VI collagen ) embedded in a hydrated matrix of proteoglycans (chondroitin sulphate and keratan sulphate). The lamellae are arranged in many layers.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Signs of Corneal Disease Superficial Punctate epithelial erosions Tiny, slightly depressed, epithelial defects which stain with fluorescein but not with rose Bengal PEE are nonspecific Punctate epithelial keratitis It is the hallmark of viral infections Swollen epithelial cells Visible unstained Stains with rose bengal Epithelial Oedema Sign of Endothelial decompensation Severe acute elevation of IOP Filaments Small comma shaped mucus strands lined with epithelium One end attached with epithelium Pannus Inflammatory or degenerative ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue from limbus</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>BLOOD SUPPLY TO CORNEA: In normal condition, cornea does not contain any blood vessels Anterior ciliary artery, a branch ophthalmic artery forms a vascular arcade in the limbal region and helps in corneal metabolism and wound repair by providing nourishment.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Paralytic squint Note:- secondary deviation more than primary deviation is seen in paralytic squint Primary deviation:- It is deviation of the affected eye and is away from the action of paralyzed muscle , e.g., if the lateral rectus is paralyzed the eye is converged. Angle of deviation varies in different directions of gaze (incomitant). Secondary deviation:- It is a deviation of the normal eye seen under cover, when the patient is made to fix with the squinting eye . It is greater than the primary deviation. This is due to the fact that the strong impulse of innervation required to enable the eye with paralyzed muscle to fix is also transmitted to the yoke muscle of the sound eye resulting in a greater amount of deviation. This is based on Hering\u2019s law of equal innervation of yoke muscles.
