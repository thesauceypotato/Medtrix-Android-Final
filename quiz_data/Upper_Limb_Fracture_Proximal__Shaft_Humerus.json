      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Gamekeeper\u2019s thumb It is an injury of the thumb leading to avulsion, rupture or damage of the ulnar collateral ligament. It is commonly seen in gamekeepers and also following a fall on an outstretched hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>This is a classic mechanism of injury, and although the description of a classic gamekeeper\u2019s thumb is a chronic injury to the ulnar collateral complex of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb, in contemporary terms any injury to the ulnar collateral complex of the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint is classified as a gamekeeper\u2019s thumb. The more contemporary name for this condition is a skier\u2019s thumb, which implies an acute injury to the ulnar collateral complex of the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. More than a sprain, specifically it is an injury to the UCL ligament of the 1st MCP joint. Option: B. No volar plate injur Option: D. No extensor pollicis brevis rupture</p>\n<p></p>",
