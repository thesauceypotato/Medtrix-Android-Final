In the midsagittal section, the fornix is seen as an arching structure that lies inferior to the corpus callosum, the massive fiber tract connecting the two cerebral hemispheres. The body of the fornix travels anteriorly and inferiorly, eventually dividing into left and right columns which curve downward in front of the thalamus.</li><li>\u27a4 Fornix</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

The gallbladder is situated more to the right and superior to the duodenum, so it is not directly in front of it.</li><li>\u2022 Note - The junction of the first and second parts of the duodenum lies posterior to the neck of the gallbladder.

The small intestine, including the jejunum, is positioned in the abdominal cavity, and its loops can be found in close proximity to the duodenum.</li><li>\u2022 Option B)</li><li>\u2022 Loops of jejunum:</li><li>\u2022 Option C) Root of mesentery: The root of the mesentery is an extension of the peritoneum that connects the small intestine (including the jejunum and ileum) to the posterior abdominal wall. It passes in front of the third part of the duodenum as it continues to the jejunum and ileum. Therefore, it is an anterior relation of the third part of the duodenum.</li><li>\u2022 Option C)</li><li>\u2022 Root of mesentery:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
