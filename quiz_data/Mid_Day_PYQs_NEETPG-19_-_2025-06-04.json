It can form a vascular ring around the trachea and esophagus, which can cause respiratory and feeding difficulties. Right Aortic Arch : This results from the regression of the left fourth aortic arch. Depending on the persistence of the ductus arteriosus, different types can form, some of which can lead to a vascular ring. Interrupted Aortic Arch : Here, there's a complete loss of continuity between the ascending and descending parts of the aorta. It's often associated with other congenital heart defects. Persistent Truncus Arteriosus : This is a failure of the truncus arteriosus to divide into the pulmonary trunk and aorta, leading to a single arterial trunk emerging from the heart supplying both systemic, pulmonary, and coronary circulations. Coarctation of the Aorta : It's a narrowing of the aorta, often occurring near the site of the ductus arteriosus. It can lead to high blood pressure in the upper body and arms and lower blood pressure in the lower body and legs. Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) : After birth, the ductus arteriosus normally closes, but in this condition, it remains open, leading to abnormal blood flow between the aorta and pulmonary artery. Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery : This is a variant in the branching pattern where the right subclavian artery arises as the last branch of the aortic arch and can course posterior to the esophagus. Cervical Aortic Arch : Here, the aortic arch is positioned higher than normal in the neck. It is usually of no clinical significance but can be identified radiologically. Aortopulmonary Septal Defects : These defects involve abnormal connections between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk. Vascular Rings : These are congenital anomalies of the aortic arch and its branches that encircle and compress the trachea and esophagus.</li><li>\u27a4 Double Aortic Arch : This involves the persistence of both the right and left fourth aortic arches.
