The most likely diagnosis for this patient will be POEMS. Another feature that will be present is- A. Endocrinopathy. B. Increased VEGF levels and not decreased. C. Osteosclerotic lesion and not osteolytic lesion. Hence, the correct answer to this question will be option A.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Mandatory major criteria 1. Polyneuropathy (typically demyelinating) 2. Monoclonal plasma cell-proliferative disorder (almost always) Other major criteria (one required) 3. CD 4. Sclerotic bone lesions 5. VEGF elevation Minor criteria (one required) 6. Organomegaly (splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or lymphadenopathy) 7. Extravascular volume overload (edema, pleural effusions, or ascites) 8. Endocrinopathy (adrenal, thyroid, pituitary, gonadal, parathyroid, or pancreatic) Minor criteria (one required) 9. Skin changes (hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, glomeruloid hemangiomata, plethora, acrocyanosis, flushing or white nails) 10. Papilledema 11.
