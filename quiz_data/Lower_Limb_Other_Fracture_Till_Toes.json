Static orthoses are used: (i) to support an arthritic joint or a fractured bone; (ii) to prevent joint contractures in a paralytic limb; and (iii) for serial splinting of a joint to correct contracture. Dynamic orthoses are used to apply forces to a joint which is damaged by arthritis or when the muscles that normally control the joint are weak. USES OF ORTHOSES Orthoses are used for the following functions: To immobilise a joint or body part e.g., a painful joint To prevent a deformity e.g., in a polio limb To correct a deformity e.g., in Volkmann's contracture To assist movement e.g., in a polio limb To relieve weight bearing e.g., in an un-united fracture To provide support e.g., to a fractured spine Some common clinical conditions requiring orthoses are cervical spondylosis or whiplash injury (common cervical collar or cervical orthosis),</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.

In others, the so called secondary clubfoot, some underlying cause such as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) can be found. Idiopathic clubfoot : Following are some of the theories proposed for the aetiology of idiopathic clubfoot: Mechanical theory : The raised intrauterine pressure forces the foot against the wall of the uterus in the position of the deformity. Ischaemic theory : Ischaemia of the calf muscles during intrauterine life, due to some unknown factor, results in contractures, leading to foot deformities. Genetic theory: Some genetically related disturbances in the development of the foot have been held responsible for the deformity. Secondary clubfoot : Following are some of the causes of secondary clubfoot: Paralytic disorders: In a case where there is a muscle imbalance i.e., the invertors and plantar flexors are stronger than the evertors and dorsiflexors, an equino-varus deformity will develop. This occurs in paralytic disorders such as polio, spina bifida, myelodysplasia and Freidreich's ataxia. Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) : This is a disorder of defective development of the muscles. The muscles are fibrotic and result in foot deformities, and deformities at other joints.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Congenital vertical talus is rarely associated with any neuromuscular diseases other than myelomeningocele but is not the most common deformity in myelomeningocele. Option: C and D: Calcaneal valgus and varus are not the most common association</p>\n<p></p>",

The main blood supply to the talus is from the anastomotic ring of blood vessels, the osseous vessels entering its neck and running postero-laterally within the bone to supply its body.

As the femur passes over the torn part of the meniscus a click may be heard. The angle of flexion at which the symptoms occurs indicates the position of the tear. The more posterior is the tear, the more flexed position of the knee is when the sign becomes positive. For lateral meniscus similar test with the foot internally rotated and examiner's hand palpating the posterolateral aspect of knee is carried out. Apley's grinding test : The patient lies prone on the couch. The knee is flexed to 90 degree and the thigh is fixed to the examination table by placing one hand on the back of the thigh. The surgeon now applies compression along the long axis of the tibia while rotating it medially and laterally on the femur (grinding movement). Pain on lateral rotation indicates a medial meniscal tear while that on medial rotation indicates a lateral meniscal tear. Medial meniscus is more frequently torn than the lateral because the medial meniscus is securely attached around the entire periphery of the joint capsule, which makes it less mobile. The lateral meniscus is more mobile and has no weak point between a movable and relatively fixed point. Popliteus muscle sends few fibers into the posterior margin of lateral meniscus.

Option B: fracture involves a fracture of both medial and lateral malleoli. X-Ray shows no bimalleolar fracture Option: C. Deltoid ligament injury is associated with high fibular fracture.
