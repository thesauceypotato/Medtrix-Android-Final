The causes can be a. Local diseases b. General diseases Infections (Osteomyelitis) Congenital disorders like osteogenesis imperfecta Bone tumors (Benign or malignant) Metabolic: Rickets, Osteomalacia, Osteoporosis etc. Disseminated diseases like multiple myeloma Diffuse involvement of bone like in Paget's diseases Features of pathological fracture Bones usually gets fractured spontaneously or after trivial injury like in osteoporosis Associated symptoms can be cough, weight loss, lump or swelling or hematuria. These are usually associated with malignant deposits (secondaries) Repeated fractures in a child may favor a diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta. Examination Infective condition may have associated infected sinus swelling or deformity. Osteoporotic patients may have pain over common sites like pubic rami or neck of femur. These may also have loss of height due to involvement of vertebra. Malignancy or secondary deposits may have associated enlargement of lymph nodes. There may be wasting of muscles palpable mass in abdomen. In these patients the rectal and surgical examination must be done. There may be associated anemia, loss weight, appetite in these patients Investigation Blood evaluation: CBC, ESR, S.Ca, S. Ph, S. alkaline phosphatase (Protein electrophoresis) Urine: May show presence of bence jones proteins X-Ray: These are the first line investigation in case of fractures. The X-Ray may show compression of vertebra like in osteoporosis, cystic lesion like in UBC (fallen fragment sign) or sclerosis around the fracture suggestive of pseudo fractures as seen in osteomalacia. If malignancy is suspected X ray of chest should always be done. MRI or CT can be done depending on the suspected pathology Biopsy may be needed in few cases to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment It depends on the cause suspected and the underlying pathological condition The different modalities that may be used to stabilize the fracture can be conservative by slab or cast application or internal fixation in long bone or prosthetic replacement like in fracture related to fracture neck of femur.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B.
