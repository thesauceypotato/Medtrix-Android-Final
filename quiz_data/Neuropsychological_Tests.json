      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Projective personality test - Thematic apperception test In this, the stories that the patient makes up concerning the pictures, according to the projective hypothesis, and the patient's own needs, thoughts, feelings, stresses, wishes, desires, and views of the future are analyzed.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. The Rorschach test is the most frequently used projective personality instrument. The test consists of ten ambiguous symmetrical inkblots. The inkblot card appears as if a blot of ink were poured onto a piece of paper and folded over hence, the symmetrical appearance. Option: C. Personality assessment inventories, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, often give abnormal results in schizophrenia, but the contribution to diagnosis and treatment planning is an objective test. Option: D. Holtzman\u2019s inkblot technique is also a projective personality test.</p>\n<p></p>",
