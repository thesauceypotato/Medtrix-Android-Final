      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. B) 2</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The label marked 2 represents the LH surge, which is responsible for ovulation. Menstrual cycle phases: Follicular phase (days 1-14): Theca and granulosa cells have increased levels of LH and FSH receptors. The uterus grows more frequently when estradiol levels rise. Estradiol's negative feedback impact on the anterior pituitary reduces the levels of FSH and LH. Low amounts of progesterone are present. Ovulation (day 14): Regardless of cycle length, ovulation occurs 14 days before menses. The release of FSH and LH is positively influenced by a spike in estradiol production at the conclusion of the follicular period (LH surge). The spike in LH brought on by estrogen triggers ovulation. The volume of cervical mucus rises, and it becomes less viscous and more sperm penetrable. Luteal phase (days 15-28): There is a high amount of progesterone. The corpus luteum begins to produce progesterone. To receive a fertilized egg, the endometrium's vascularity and secretory activity increase. If fertilization is unsuccessful, the corpus luteum regresses at the conclusion of the luteal phase. Estradiol and progesterone levels consequently drop sharply. Menses (days 0-4): When estradiol and progesterone are abruptly stopped, the endometrium sloughs off.</li><li>\u2022 The label marked 2 represents the LH surge, which is responsible for ovulation.</li><li>\u2022 The label marked 2 represents the LH surge, which is responsible for ovulation.</li><li>\u2022 Menstrual cycle phases: Follicular phase (days 1-14): Theca and granulosa cells have increased levels of LH and FSH receptors.

D) Increased prolactin secretion</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Increased prolactin release is the cause of lactational amenorrhea. Prolactin is secreted in pulsatile bursts during lactation in response to sucking, and this suppresses GnRH, LH, and FSH, which results in lactational amenorrhea. If the woman remains amenorrheic, regular lactation with one feed at night can delay ovulation and conception for up to six months. (Lactational amenorrhoea method) After six months, nursing has little effect on ovulation, and conception is still possible despite amenorrhea and the potential need for additional contraceptives.</li><li>\u2022 Increased prolactin release is the cause of lactational amenorrhea.</li><li>\u2022 Prolactin is secreted in pulsatile bursts during lactation in response to sucking, and this suppresses GnRH, LH, and FSH, which results in lactational amenorrhea.</li><li>\u2022 If the woman remains amenorrheic, regular lactation with one feed at night can delay ovulation and conception for up to six months.

In individuals with the MH mutation, certain volatile anesthetics like halothane can abnormally activate the mutated Ryanodine receptor.
