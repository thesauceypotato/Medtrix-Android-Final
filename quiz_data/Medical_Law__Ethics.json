      "text": "In a complex medical malpractice lawsuit, Amit, a 40-year-old patient, underwent a routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy at a reputable hospital. The surgery was performed by Dr. Sheela, a highly skilled surgeon. However, during the procedure, an unforeseen event occurred. Amit sustained a deep laceration to her abdominal aorta, a major blood vessel, which required immediate vascular surgery to repair. Despite the seriousness of the injury, Amit's legal team encountered difficulties in identifying the precise cause of the aortic laceration or pinpointing a specific act of negligence. There were no clear breaches of established surgical protocols, and Dr. Sheela's credentials and experience were impeccable. In the context of this challenging case, which legal doctrine might Amit's legal team invoke to establish negligence?",
