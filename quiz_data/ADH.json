      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Vasopressin Diabetes insipidus is characterized by morbid thirst and hyper diuresis with no alterations of glucose levels in blood and urine. The cause of this disease is the deficiency of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), so the administration of vasopressin is the most appropriate treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Drug Class: Vasoconstrictor & Anti-Diuretic Hormone (ADH) Mechanism of Action: Supraphysiologic concentrations: vasopressin constricts arterial blood vessels by binding to vascular V1 vascular receptors. This makes it potentially useful in maintaining arterial blood pressure in a setting of cardiac arrest. Normal physiologic concentrations: Stimulation of V2 receptors in the cell membrane of the collecting duct promotes the translocation and insertion of aquaporin 2 water channel containing vesicles, into the collecting duct apical membrane. Indications: The management of cardiac arrest Treatment of diabetes insipidus To control polydipsia, polyuria, and dehydration caused by a deficiency of endogenous ADH (neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus). Desmopressin (a synthetic V2 agonist) is usually considered the drug of choice. treatment of postoperative abdominal distension</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect  Options: Option A. Thyroxine increases the rate of chemical reactions in cells and helps control growth and development. Option B. The two main physical functions of oxytocin are to stimulate uterine contractions in labor and childbirth and to stimulate contractions of breast tissue to aid in lactation after childbirth. Option D.
