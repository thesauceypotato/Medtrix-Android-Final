      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Lipogranuloma Focal swelling of the eyelid is a common complaint in both primary care and urgent care settings. Often, such swelling is identified as either a chalazion, appearing as a characteristically firm and painless lid nodule, or a hordeolum (stye) , which is usually painful and tender, although several other benign and malignant processes can be mistaken for these two. Chalazia (plural of chalazion) , the most common inflammatory lesions of the eyelid, are slowly enlarging eyelid nodules, formed by inflammation and obstruction of sebaceous glands of the eyelids. Chalazia can be categorized as either superficial or deep, depending on the glands that are blocked.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Inflammation of a tarsal meibomian gland leads to a deep chalazion, whereas inflammation of a Zeis gland leads to a superficial chalazion .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B.

Childhood blepharokeratoconjunctivitis is a poorly defined condition that tends to be more severe in Asian and Middle Eastern populations. Presentation is usually at about 6 years of age with recurrent episodes of anterior or posterior blepharitis, sometimes associated with recurrent styes or chalazia . Constant eye rubbing and photophobia may lead to misdiagnosis as allergic eye disease. Option: B. Angular blepharitis is usually caused by Moraxella lacunata or aureus although other bacteria and, rarely, herpes simplex have also been implicated. Red, scaly, macerated and fissured skin is seen at the lateral and/or medial canthi of one or both eyes. Skin chafing secondary to tear overflow, especially at the lateral canthus, can cause a similar clinical picture and may also predispose to infection. Option: C. Ticks can attach themselves to the eyelid and should be removed at the earliest opportunity in order to minimize the risk of contracting a tick-borne zoonosis such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain fever, African tick bite fever or tularemia . If the tick has attached some distance from the eye such that spray can safely be applied, an insect repellent containing pyrethrin or a pyrethroid should be sprayed on the tick twice at intervals of a minute. Alternatively, a scabies cream containing permethrin can be applied. Option: D. The crab louse Phthirus pubis is adapted to living in pubic hair but is also commonly found in other hair-covered body areas such as the chest, axillae and eyelids (phthiriasis palpebrarum) . Ova and their empty shells appear as oval, brownish, opalescent pearls adherent to the base of the cilia Option: E. Symptoms of posterior blepharitis are caused by disruption of normal ocular surface function and reduction in tear stability and are similar in all forms of blepharitis, though stinging may be more common in the posterior disease. Pressure on the lid margin results in the expression of meibomian fluid that may be turbid or toothpaste-like.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>In severe cases, the secretions become so inspissated that expression is impossible.

Her symptoms are unrelated to any systemic illness Including allergy, rosacea or flu-like symptoms. Her visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes without correction and her intraocular pressure is normal. Slit-lamp examination reveals mild erythema of the eyelid margin associated with scaling and the formation of crusting around the base of the eyelashes. Evidence of trichiasis, madarosis.

Hordeolum externum or stye is a suppurative inflammation of a Zeis gland. In the early stages, the gland becomes swollen, hard and painful, and usually, the whole edge of the lid is oedematous. An abscess forms which generally points near the base of one of the cilia. The pain is considerable until the pus is removed.

Impaired activity of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase is the mechanism of action of rifampin. Rifampin is part of the multidrug regimen used to treat tuberculosis but it is not associated with optic neuropathy.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Adverse effects of treatment with rifampin include hepatotoxicity and orange discolouration of body fluids. Furthermore, rifampin induces CYP450 activity, leading to interaction with various other drugs (e.g., clarithromycin).</p>\n<p></p>",

Usually in elderly people , with depressed cellular immunity, it reactivates and travels down along the branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve and produces cutaneous and ocular lesions. Involvement of the tip of the nose is associated with eye involvement (Hutchinson's rule).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Vesicular rash in the distribution of the cutaneous branch of ophthalmic division points towards herpes zoster ophthalmicus.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Herpes simplex keratitis It is usually seen in children . The rash involves the lips, nose, eyes (HSV I) or genitals (HSV II). The rash doesn't follow the characteristic distribution (strict limitation to one side of the midline) of VZV. It presents with pain, photophobia, lacrimation and blepharospasm. Option: B. Bacterial keratitis Bacterial keratitis is usually seen in contact lens wearers, or following trauma, or chronic steroid use. It presents with red eye, conjunctival and circumcorneal congestion and hazy cornea with or without ulcer or hypopyon. Option: C. Trigeminal neuralgia The diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia is made clinically based on history. It is characterized by a stabbing or shock-like pain over the distribution of the maxillary or mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. It does not cause a rash.</p>\n<p></p>",
