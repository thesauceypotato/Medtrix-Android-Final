In addition to the liver, these isoforms are expressed in the intestine (responsible for first-pass metabolism at this site) and kidney as well. Inhibition of this isoenzyme by erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, and itraconazole is responsible for the important drug interaction with terfenadine, astemizole, and cisapride which are its substrates.

CYP2D6: is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the CYP2D6 gene. CYP2D6 is primarily expressed in the liver. It is also highly expressed in areas of the central nervous system, including the substantia nigra. CYP2D6, a member of the cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase system Option: C . CYP2C9: is an enzyme protein. The enzyme is involved in the metabolism, by oxidation, of both xenobiotics, including drugs, and endogenous compounds, including fatty acids. In humans, the protein is encoded by the CYP2C9 gene Option: D. CYP1A1 :  family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CYP1A1 gene.
