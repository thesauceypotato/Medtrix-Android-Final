The size of the wound has only a limited relationship with the distance of the firearm weapon; in any case not reliable. When we say that the 'Entry wound without singeing and tattooing' means that the distance of the firearm weapon at the time of discharge is more than the range of tattooing,e., more than 60 cm.

At close range, while the shots are bunched, they strike one another upon impact on the primary target, i.e., the skin or clothes, and spread out in a wide pattern as they pass through the body. This causes the shot to spread widely and may suggest a greater range of fire than occurred.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Welding of the ball- Balling of shotgun pellets results in the conversion of the shot into a compact mass, which can travel for a few meters in this form. In such cases, a circular or oval entrance wound of about 5 to 10 mm. in diameter and widespread, small, circular punctures are seen, suggesting the use of two different weapons, one a shotgun at a distant range and the other a rifle. Option: C. Internal ricochet occurs when a bullet, rather than exiting the body, gets deflected and forms a new track inside the body. This doesn\u2019t increase the range of firing.</p>\n<p></p>",
