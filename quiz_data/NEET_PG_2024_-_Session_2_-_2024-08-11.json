This binding opens ligand-gated Na\u207a channels, allowing an influx of sodium ions, which depolarizes the muscle membrane and generates an action potential. The action potential travels along the motor neuron to the axon terminal, where it triggers the opening of voltage-gated Ca\u00b2\u207a channels. The entry of calcium ions into the axon terminal facilitates the exocytosis of Ach into the synaptic cleft, which then binds to receptors on the muscle fiber to propagate the signal for muscle contraction.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Ligand-gated Na\u207a channel opens \u2192 Action potential at motor end plate \u2192 Ca\u00b2\u207a entry in Axon Terminal \u2192 Ach Release: This sequence incorrectly initiates with the opening of ligand-gated Na\u207a channels before Ach is released.
