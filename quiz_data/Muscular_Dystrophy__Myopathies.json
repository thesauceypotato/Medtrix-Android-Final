In DMD, the absence of dystrophin leads to progressive muscle weakness and wasting. Features: Symptoms appear in early childhood Difficulty walking, frequent falls, and muscle weakness in the hips, thighs, and shoulders. As the disease progresses, it can affect the heart and respiratory muscles, leading to life-threatening complications.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy: It (DMD) is caused by a mutation in the DMD gene on the X chromosome, leading to the absence or decreased production of the dystrophin protein. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Option: C. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy: It (EDMD) is caused by mutations in several genes, including EMD and LMNA, and is inherited in an X-linked or autosomal dominant pattern. EDMD is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting joint contractures, and cardiac involvement. Option: D. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy: It (LGMD) is a group of inherited muscle disorders caused by mutations in various genes. LGMD typically affects the proximal muscles of the hips and shoulders, leading to difficulty walking and climbing stairs. LGMD can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern, depending on the subtype.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Feature Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 Myotonic Dystrophy type 2 Genetic cause Expansion of CTG repeat in DMPK gene Expansion of CCTG repeat in CNBP gene Chromosome location 19q13.3 3q21.3-3q24 Onset age Any age, but usually before age 40 Later onset, usually after age 50 Muscles involved Distal and proximal muscles, facial muscles, and muscles involved in swallowing and breathing Mainly proximal muscles Myotonia severity Severe Mild to moderate</p>\n<p></p>",
