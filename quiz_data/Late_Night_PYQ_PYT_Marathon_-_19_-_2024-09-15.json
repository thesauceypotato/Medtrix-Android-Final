IGF-I promotes cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation, particularly in bone and cartilage, making it essential for normal childhood growth and the growth spurt seen during puberty.

Structurally, it closely resembles Luteinizing Hormone (LH), sharing a common alpha subunit and a similar beta subunit, though hCG has additional amino acid sequences that provide it with unique properties. The structural similarity between hCG and LH allows hCG to bind to LH receptors on the corpus luteum, preventing its involution and thereby maintaining progesterone production essential for sustaining early pregnancy. This functional overlap is crucial for supporting the pregnancy until the placenta assumes progesterone production.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
