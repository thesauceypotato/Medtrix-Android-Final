As the condition progresses, the opacities become more confluent in the superficial cornea.The genetic locus is 5q3 l and the gene involved in TGF B 1 . Inheritance is autosomal dominant . Signs: The condition is ch:aracterised by milky granular hyaline deposits in anterior stroma. Intervening stroma is clear. Opacities do not extend to the limbus. In children, there may be a vortex pattern of brownish granules superficial to the Bowman layer. In later life, granules may extend into the deeper stroma, down to the Descemet membrane.

Primary open angle glaucoma is its common association. Inheritance It may be autosomal dominant or sporadic (more common) in nature. genetic locus is 13p. No gene has been associated. Clinical features can be divided into following four stages: Stage of cornea guttata . It is characterised by the presence of Hassall-Henle type of excrescences in the central part of cornea. A gradual increase of central guttae with peripheral spread and confluence gives rise to the so-called 'beaten-metal' appearance. This stage is asymptomatic. Oedematous stage or stage of endothelial decompensation is characterised by the occurrence of early stromal oedema and epithelial dystrophy. Patients complain of blurring vision. Stage of bullous keratopathy . This stage follows longstanding stromal oedema and is characterised by marked epithelial oedema with formation of bullae, when rupture causes pain, discomfort and irritation with associated decreased visual acuity. Stage of scarring . In this stage, epithelial bullae are replaced by scar tissue and the cornea becomes opaque and vascularized. The condition may sometimes be complicated by occurrence of secondary infection or glaucoma. Specular microscopy reveals decreased endothelial cell count, increased average cell diameter, decreased hexagons and increased variation in cell size. Treatment is as follows : Hypertonic saline: (5% sodium chloride ) may be of some use in the early edematous stage. Warm air blown on the eyes (e.ghair dryer) helps reduce oedema. Intraocular pressure lowering drugs, e.g. 0.5% timolol or others, should be used to treat associated ocular hypertension. Bandaged soft contact lenses provide some relief from disturbing symptoms in the bullous keratopathy stage. Penetrating keratoplasty is the treatment of choice when the visual acuity is reduced markedly.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
