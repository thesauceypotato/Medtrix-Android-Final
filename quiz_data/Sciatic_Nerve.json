It is the longest and widest single nerve in the human body, going from the top of the leg to the foot on the posterior aspect. I t is derived from spinal nerves L4 to S3. It contains fibres from both the anterior and posterior divisions of the lumbosacral plexus.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The sciatic nerve has no cutaneous branches for the thigh . This nerve provides the connection to the nervous system for the skin of the lateral leg and the whole foot, the muscles of the back of the thigh, and those of the leg and foot.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B - Nerve to obturator internus and gemellus superior-L5-S2 Option C - Nerve to quadratus femoris and gemellus inferior L4-S1 Option D - Posterior femoral cutaneous S2-S3</p>\n<p></p>",

It runs posteriorly between the lumbosacral trunk and the first sacral ramus or between the first and second rami. Then it turns slightly inferiorly, leaving the pelvis by the greater sciatic foramen above piriformis and dividing into superficial and deep branches. Option C- The superior gluteal veins are the venae comitantes of the superior gluteal artery. They receive tributaries corresponding to the superior gluteal artery branches and enter the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen, above piriformis. They join the internal iliac vein, frequently as a single trunk. Option D- The inferior gluteal artery is the larger terminal branch of the anterior internal iliac trunk and principally supplies the buttock and thigh. It descends posteriorly, anterior to the sacral plexus and piriformis, but posterior to the internal pudendal artery. It passes between the first, second, or second and third sacral ventral rami, then between piriformis and ischiococcygeus, before running through the lower part of the greater sciatic foramen to reach the gluteal region.</p>\n<p></p>",

Close to its origin, it crosses anterior to the piriformis, the sacral plexus and the inferior gluteal artery. It descends laterally to the inferior rim of the greater sciatic foramen, where it leaves the pelvis between the piriformis and is chi coccygeus and enters the gluteal region. It next curves around the dorsum of the ischial spine and enters the ischiorectal fossa via the lesser sciatic foramen. Option B - The internal pudendal veins are venae comitantes of the internal pudendal artery and unite as a single vessel that drains into the internal iliac vein. They receive veins from the inferior rectal veins, the penile bulb and scrotum (males), or the clitoris and labia (females). Option D - Obturator nerve - The obturator nerve arises from the ventral branches of the second to fourth lumbar ventral rami. The branch from the third is the largest, while that from the second is often very small. The nerve descends in the psoas major, emerging from its medial border at the pelvic brim to pass behind the common iliac vessels and lateral to the internal iliac vessels. It then descends forwards along the lateral wall of the lesser pelvis on the obturator internus, anterosuperior to the obturator vessels, to the obturator foramen, entering the thigh by its upper part. Near the foramen, it divides into anterior and posterior branches, separated at first by part of obturator externus and lower down by adductor brevis.</p>\n<p></p>",

Option C - T he common fibular nerve is relatively unprotected as it traverses the lateral aspect of the neck of the fibula and is easily compressed at this site, e.g. by plaster casts or ganglia. The nerve may also become entrapped by a fascial band beneath the fibularis longus within the so-called fibular tunnel, between the attachments of fibularis longus to the head and shaft of the fibula leading to traction lesion. Option D - Lessions of the superficial fibular nerve-A lesion of the superficial fibular nerve causes weakness of foot eversion and sensory loss on the lateral aspect of the leg that extends onto the dorsum of the foot. The nerve can be subject to entrapment as it penetrates the deep fascia of the leg, and it may also be involved in compartment syndrome that affects the lateral compartment of the leg.</p>\n<p></p>",
