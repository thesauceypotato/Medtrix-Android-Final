      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Trichuris Trichiura Also known as whipworm, can cause gastrointestinal problems, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, mucus or bloody stools, weight loss, iron deficiency anaemia, painful urination, and weakness. Rectal prolapse is a hallmark, albeit rare, symptom of a heavy T. trichiura infection that occurs in children more frequently than adults. When rectal prolapse occurs, worms can often be identified on the edematous rectum. Sigmoidoscopy shows characteristic white adult worm bodies hanging from inflamed mucosa (\u2018Coconut cake rectum). In a whipworm infection, the rectum loses its internal support because the worms bury their thin heads into the intestinal lining, loosening the elastic epithelium and weakening the surrounding muscles. Giardia lamblia attached to the bowel wall may cause irritation and low-grade inflammation of the duodenal or jejunal mucosa, with consequent acute or chronic diarrhea associated with crypt hypertrophy, villous atrophy or flattening, and epithelial cell damage. Stools may be watery, semisolid, greasy, bulky, and foul smelling at various times during the course of the infection. Symptoms of malaise, weakness, weight loss, abdominal cramps, distention, and flatulence may continue for a long period. Stool examination reveals characteristic tetra nucleated cysts and/or pear shaped trophozoites with falling leaf motility. Campylobacter jejuni are Gram-negative rods with comma, S, or \u201cgull wing\u201d shapes. They are motile, with a single polar flagellum, and do not form spores. Clinical manifestations are acute onset of crampy abdominal pain, profuse diarrhea that may be grossly bloody, headache, malaise, and fever. Usually the illness is self-limited to a period of 5\u20138 days. C difficile causes antibiotic associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis. Pseudomembranous colitis is diagnosed by detection of one or both C difficile toxins in stool and by endoscopic observation of pseudomembranes or microabscesses in patients who have diarrhea and have been given antibiotics. Pseudomembranous colitis is diagnosed by detection of one or both C difficile toxins in stool and by endoscopic observation of pseudomembranes or microabscesses in patients who have diarrhea and have been given antibiotics.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is endemic in many parts of the world, i.e. China, Japan, Korea, Philippines. Crab/ Cray fish are the 2 nd intermediate host in Paragonimus. During invasion and migration of the flukes, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, cough, urticaria, hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary abnormalities, and eosinophilia may develop. Paragonimus is acquired by eating encysted metacercaria in crustacean hosts such as crayfish or freshwater crab. Metacercaria penetrate intestinal wall to migrate into abdominal cavity, causing abdominal tenderness, nausea and vomiting. They then migrate to lungs and develop into adult worms to cause pulmonary paragonimiasis (Eosinophilic granulomatous inflammation in lungs leading to formation of fibrotic capsules or cysts surrounding the worms). Cysts contain blood mixed thick purulent fluid containing flukes and golden brown eggs. When cysts break up into bronchioles, blood mixed sputum is expectorated. Heavy infection presents with symptoms as productive cough with brownish blood tinged rusty sputum or sometimes frank hemoptysis with peripheral blood eosinophilia. Bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pneumonia or lung abscess may be seen in chronic cases. Rarely, the worms from ruptured cysts migrates to various extra pulmonary sites such as liver, spleen, abdominal wall or brain. The clinical picture resembles and is often confused with TB. Praziquantel is the treatment of choice.</p>\n<p></p>",

Two predominant transmission cycles: Pig--------------- Culex ----------- Pig Ardeid birds --- Culex --- Ardeid birds Man is dead end. Pigs and wild birds serve as a reservoir for the virus. Pigs are amplifier hosts. Causes encephalitis in children < 15 years of age, less commonly in elderly, but usually infants are not affected. Seen more in the rainy season. JE is endemic in our country in > 15 states with maximum cases form UP (Gorakhpur district) Ratio of Cases to Subclinical infection very low (1: 300-1000) Symptoms may include headache, vomiting, fever, confusion, and seizures. Paragonimus westermani is the lung fluke with two intermediate hosts;1st freshwater snail and 2 nd crab or Crayfish and man is the definitive host. It is acquired by ingestion. Plague is an infection of wild rodents transmitted from one rodent to another and occasionally from rodents to humans by the bites of fleas. Yersinia pestis is a gram negative rod that exhibits bipolar staining with Wright, Giemsa, methylene blue or Wayson. Malaria is a parasitic disease with female anopheles\u2019 mosquito as definitive host and man as the intermediate hosts. It is acquired by bite of female anopheles.

Amoebic ulcers mainly develop in Caecum, less commonly involve other sites like recto sigmoid, appendix etc. Disease occurs when amoeba comes in contact with the cells lining the intestine. It then secretes the same substances it uses to digest bacteria, which include enzymes that destroy cell membranes and proteins. Rapid lateral spread of the multiplying amebae follows, undermining the mucosa and producing the characteristic \u201cflask-shaped\u201d ulcer of primary amebiasis: a small point of entry, leading via a narrow neck through the mucosa into an expanded necrotic area in the submucosa. Bacterial invasion usually does not occur at this time, cellular reaction is limited, and damage is by lytic necrosis Entamoeba histolytica ingests the destroyed cell by Phagocytosis and is often seen with red blood cells (a process known as erythrophagocytosis) inside when viewed in stool samples.</p>\n<p></p>",

Both CMV and EBV mononucleosis cause fever and fatigue. But EBV also causes a severe sore throat. CMV causes congenital infection and may result in death of the fetus in utero. Clinical features include intrauterine growth retardation, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia , microcephaly, and retinitis. The mechanisms of CMV damage to the fetus are complex and include a combination of direct fetal injury induced by pathologic virally-encoded gene products, an inability of the maternal immune response to control infection, and the direct impact of infection on placental function. These include products which modify the cell cycle, interfere with apoptosis, induce an inflammatory response, mediate vascular injury, dysregulated cellular proliferation and facilitate evasion of host immune responses.</p>\n<p></p>",

Patient should be kept in isolation room with strict infection control practices required for prevention of droplet transmission. Even if an infected person doesn\u2019t show any signs or symptoms of diphtheria, they\u2019re still able to transmit the bacterial infection for up to six weeks after the initial infection. The bacteria most commonly infect nose and throat. Once infected, the bacteria release toxins. Diphtheria toxin is absorbed into the mucous membranes and causes destruction of epithelium and a superficial inflammatory response. The necrotic epithelium becomes embedded in exuding fibrin and red and white cells, so that a greyish \u201cpseudomembrane\u201d is formed\u2014commonly seen over the tonsils, pharynx, or larynx. Any attempt to remove the pseudomembrane exposes and tears the capillaries and thus results in bleeding. The regional lymph nodes in the neck enlarge, and there may be marked edema of the entire neck, with distortion of the airway, often referred to as \u201cbull neck\u201d clinically. MRSA mainly spread through hands of health care workers. Proper hand hygiene is very effective in prevention of infection. Rubella spread through droplet, contact, in- utero infection. It has a period of communicability one week before and one week after the onset of rash. But it is less communicable in comparison to Diphtheria as coughing is not severe and hence isolation is not needed. However, exposure of infected people to pregnant and immunocompromised people are avoided.</p>\n<p></p>",
