So Now for RNA, change T to U. So, we get 3\u2019 CUAGAUG 5\u2019. Now in the options, polarity is not given so assume they are asking you for RNA sequence in a 5' - 3' direction. Now we have to arrange the RNA sequence from the 5\u2019 - 3\u2019 direction. So the answer is 5\u2019 GUAGAUC 3\u2019.</p>\n<p></p>",
