It is worth noting that, in such patients, lymphoedema often commences proximally in the thigh rather than distally. There is obstruction at the level of the aortoiliac or inguinal nodes. The patient may benefit from a lymphatic bypass operation if associated with distal dilatation. Other patients have distal obliteration as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Lymphoedema : Lymphoedema may be defined as abnormal limb swelling caused by the accumulation of increased amounts of high protein ISF secondary to defective lymphatic drainage in the presence of (near) normal net capillary filtration Pathology: Result of an inability of the existing lymphatic system to accommodate the protein and fluid entering the interstitial compartment at the tissue level.

Oedema is irreversible at this stage. Aetiological classification of lymphoedema: Primary lymphoedema Congenital (onset <2 years old): sporadic; familial (Nonne\u2013Milroy\u2019s disease) Praecox (onset 2\u201335 years old): sporadic; familial (Letessier\u2013Meige\u2019s disease) Tarda (onset after 35 years old) Secondary lymphoedema A parasitic infection (filariasis) Fungal infection (tinea pedis) Exposure to foreign body material (silica particles) Primary malignancy Metastatic spread to lymph nodes Radiotherapy to lymph nodes Surgical excision of lymph nodes Trauma (particularly degloving injuries) Superficial thrombophlebitis Deep venous thrombosis.

Limb Elevation at night Avoid standing for prolonged periods Complex Decongestive Physical Therapy Compression Pump Therapy (Pneumatic Compression therapy) Drug Therapy - Benzopyrones Molecular Lymphangiogenesis Operative Treatment : Reconstructive - should be considered for those patients with proximal (either primary or secondary) obstruction of the extremity lymphatic circulation with preserved, dilated lymphatics peripheral to the obstruction. Excisional - only viable option for patients without residual lymphatics of adequate size for reconstructive procedures. For patients with recalcitrant stage II and early stage III lymphedema in whom the edema is moderate and the skin is relatively healthy, an excisional procedure that removes a large segment of the lymphedematous subcutaneous tissues and the overlying skin is the procedure of choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. Swelling, usually of the whole leg, due to iliofemoral venous obstruction. Venous skin changes, secondary varicose veins on the leg and collateral veins on the lower abdominal wall. Venous claudication may be present. Option C. There may be an obvious predisposing factor, such as recent surgery . The classical signs of pain and redness may be absent. Option D.

Other causes of secondary lymphedema include radiation therapy, trauma, deep venous thrombosis, infection, and malignancy.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Post-mastectomy irradiation Lymphoedema of the arm is a troublesome complication of breast cancer treatment, fortunately, seen less often now that radical axillary dissection and radiotherapy are rarely combined. However, it still occasionally occurs after either mode of treatment alone and appears at any time from months to years after treatment. There is usually no precipitating cause but recurrent tumour should be excluded because neoplastic infiltration of the axilla can cause arm swelling due to both lymphatic and venous blockage. Lymphedema developing post-mastectomy can even complicate Stewart Treves syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mastectomy is indicated for large tumours (in relation to the size of the breast), multicentric disease, diffuse microcalcification on a mammogram indicative of DCIS, BRCA-positive cancers, local recurrence following BCS or the patient\u2019s preference. It entails the removal of the entire breast tissue, including the skin over the tumour, the nipple-areola complex and the axillary tail Complications of Mastectomy Wound infections: The majority are due to skin flap necrosis Lymphedema Seroma MC complication beneath skin flaps and axilla occurs in 30% of cases A catheter is retained until drainage is < 30 ml/day Injury to Long Thoracic (Motor) Nerve Seen in 10% of all cases.
