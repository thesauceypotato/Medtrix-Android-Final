      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Chediak Higashi Syndrome</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Chediak Higashi Syndrome Autosomal recessive . Defect in the LYST gene (chromosome 1) Inherited defects in phagolysosome formation . Defective fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes , resulting in defective phagocytes function and susceptibility to infections . Leukocytes contain giant granules , which can be readily seen in peripheral blood smears</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Chronic Granulomatous Disease. Is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by defects in bacterial killing that render patients susceptible to recurrent bacterial infection . Option: C. Ataxia telangiectasia. Is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by defects in ATM , a gene encoding a kinase that acts upstream of p53. This syndrome is characterized by neurodegeneration (particularly of the cerebellum, hence the ataxia), immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity to radiation (due to an inability to repair double-stranded DNA breaks), and predisposition to cancer, particularly certain forms of leukaemia and lymphoma. Option: D. Fanconi Anemia. Is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in a pathway that repairs DNA cross-links through homologous recombination . It is characterized by developmental abnormalities (short stature, skeletal abnormalities), hypersensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents that cross-link DNA, and an increased risk of bone marrow failure (aplasia) and leukaemia .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Defective degranulation of : platelets impaired clot formation and excessive bleeding etc. WBC: Neutropenia , increases in fection risk Platelets: Increased bleeding tendencies Melanasomes: Albinism</p>\n<p></p>",
