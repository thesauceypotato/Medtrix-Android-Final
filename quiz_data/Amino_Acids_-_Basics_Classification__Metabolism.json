As a result, massive aminoaciduria occurs (mainly tryptophan in urine). Soluble carrier family (SLC) proteins are transmembrane proteins involved in facilitated diffusion and secondary active transport. Tryptophan is used to synthesize serotonin, melatonin, and niacin.

HHH syndrome Ornithine translocase deficiency, also called hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria ( HHH ) syndrome , is a rare autosomal recessive, urea cycle transporter defect, which causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood. Option: D. Alkaptonuria Alkaptonuria is due to a defect in homogentisic acid oxidase. The urine of the patient turns black on exposure to air due to enzyme homogentisic acid oxidation.

As a result, these amino acids are excreted in the urine. Clinical Features Autosomal Recessive Burnt sugar-like odor (because of isoleucine) Ketosis, vomiting, feeding problems Mental retardation (because of increased leucine) Abnormal muscle tone If not treated, then coma (because of increased leucine) Death can occur (high mortality rate)</p>\n<p></p>",
