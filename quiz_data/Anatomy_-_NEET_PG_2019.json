Papillary ducts represent the most distal portion of the collecting duct. They receive renal filtrate (precursor to urine) from several medullary collecting ducts and empty into a minor calyx. Duct of Bellini</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The collecting duct system of the kidney consists of a series of tubules and ducts that physically connect nephrons to a minor calyx or directly to the renal pelvis. The collecting duct system is the last part of nephron and participates in electrolyte and fluid balance through reabsorption and excretion, processes regulated by the hormones aldosterone and vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A.

In humans, the system accounts for 4\u20135% of the kidney's reabsorption of sodium and 5% of the kidney's reabsorption of water. At times of extreme dehydration, over 24% of the filtered water may be reabsorbed in the collecting duct system.</p>\n<p></p>",

(b) The postganglionic fibres arise from this ganglion and directly supply the submandibular gland. Sympathetic supply: The preganglionic fibres arise from T1 spinal segment and enter the cervical sympathetic trunk to relay in its superior cervical sympathetic ganglion. The postganglionic fibres arise from superior cervical sympathetic ganglion, form plexus around the facial artery, and thus reach gland through this artery. Sensory supply: The gland gets its sensory supply by the lingual nerve. Earlier it was thought that only parasympathetic supply is secretomotor and sympathetic supply is vasomotor. Now it is established without doubt that both parasympathetic and sympathetic supplies are secretomotor. Parasympathetic stimulation produces watery secretion whereas sympathetic stimulation produces sticky mucus-rich secretion. In addition,  sympathetic supply is vasomotor.
