Commonly provided by the hospital pharmacy in the form of a 3-litre bag containing a lipid emulsion with a mixture of essential and non-essential amino acids, glucose, electrolytes, trace elements and vitamins. Usually administered directly into the central venous system (the superior vena cava [SVC] or the right atrium) to minimise the risk of venous thrombophlebitis, through either a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) or central venous catheter. Femoral lines should be avoided for parenteral nutrition because of the high risk of infection.

The main underlying pathological process is one of hypophosphatemia, resulting in fluid and electrolyte shifts between the intra and extracellular compartments. Presentation includes arrythmias, muscle weakness, respiratory or cardiac failure, oedema, lethargy or seizures; and at its most severe, the syndrome can be fatal. Laboratory tests will reveal low levels of phosphate, potassium, calcium and magnesium and a lactic acidosis. Nutritional support in this group of patients should be started at a maximum of 10 kcal/kg per day, aiming to increase levels slowly to meet full needs by 4\u20137 days. Liver dysfunction : Long-term use of parenteral nutrition is associated with derangement of liver function tests in at least 25% of patients . Fatty liver is a common complication. This is worse in children, and the degree can be reduced by modifying the parenteral nutrition solution, such as alternating the use of lipid-free parenteral nutrition solutions.

Based on Master-Slave principle . During the procedure, the surgeon controls the robot sitting in the console (image in question) and this translates into movements of robotic arms (image shown below) which are connected the instruments at the operating field. Indications are - Prostatectomy, cardiac valve repair, gynecological operations The current era of surgical robots is dominated by the da Vinci\u00ae surgical system, which was first approved for clinical use in 2000. The system offers a number of advantages, including 3D surgical vision, EndoWrist\u00ae precision instruments, tremor reduction, and motion scaling and improved ergonomics. Improved maneuvering as a result of the \u2018robotic wrist\u2019 in some systems allows for up to seven degrees of freedom, thus improving dexterity for the surgeon The enclosed console system of many robotic systems also provides the advantage of surgical isolation from external distractions that may impact on the operator\u2019s concentration.

The passage of current through the body tissues can interfere with cardiac pacemaker. In bipolar diathermy, the two active electrodes are usually represented by the limbs of a pair of diathermy forceps, blades of scissors or graspers. Both forceps ends are therefore active and current flows between them and only the tissue held between the limbs of the forceps heats up. This form of diathermy is used when working in sensitive areas (e.g. near the recurrent laryngeal nerve in thyroid surgery) or in patients with implantable electrical devices, as current can interfere with these devices.

The Veress needle can be inserted in the umbilical region or in other regions of the abdomen, such as Palmer\u2019s point . A 10-mm incision in Palmer\u2019s point (3 cm below the left costal margin, in the mid-clavicular plane) is the location preferred by many surgeons for Veress needle insertion. The needle is advanced until it reaches the muscle. The abdominal wall is then lifted and the needle advanced through the oblique muscles.
