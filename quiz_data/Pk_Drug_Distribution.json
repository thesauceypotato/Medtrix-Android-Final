NICOUMALONE is primarily used to prevent and treat various types of thromboembolic diseases (blood clots inside blood vessels), including deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in leg veins) and pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lung). Deep vein thrombosis is a medical condition in which blood clots form in deep veins, usually in the legs. Pulmonary embolism is a condition in which a blood clot blocks the arteries in the lungs.

Glomerular filtration does not reduce the concentration of the free form in the efferent vessels, because water is also filtered. Active tubular secretion, however, removes the drug without the attendant solvent \u2192 concentration of free drug falls \u2192 bound drug dissociates and is eliminated resulting in a higher renal clearance value of the drug than the total renal blood flow The same is true of the active transport of highly extracted drugs in the liver. Plasma protein binding in this situation acts as a carrier mechanism and hastens drug elimination, E.g. excretion of penicillin (elimination t\u00bd is 30 min); metabolism of lidocaine. Highly protein-bound drugs are not removed by hemodialysis and need special techniques for the treatment of poisoning</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
