      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia All forms of the long QT syndrome involve an abnormal repolarization of the heart. The abnormal repolarization causes differences in the refractory period of the heart muscle cells. After depolarizations can be propagated to neighboring cells due to the differences in the refractory periods, leading to re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias like torsades de pointes/ polymorphic VT. Early After-Depolarizations (EADs) that are seen in LQTS are due to the re-opening of L- type calcium channels during the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential. Since adrenergic stimulation can increase the activity of these channels this is an explanation for why the risk of sudden death in individuals with LQTS is increased during increased adrenergic states (i.e., exercise, excitement) especially since repolarization is impaired. Normally during adrenergic states, repolarizing currents will also be enhanced to shorten the action potential. In the absence of the shortening and the presence of increased L-type calcium current, EADs may arise. The Jervell and Lange- Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is an autosomal recessive form of LQTS with associated congenital deafness. It is caused specifically by mutation of the KCNE1 and KCNQ1 genes In untreated individuals with JLNS, about 50 percent die by the age of 15 years due to ventricular arrhythmias Romano-Ward syndrome is an autosomal dominant form of LQTS that is not associated with deafness.

In stage 1, there is a widespread elevation of the ST segments, often with upward concavity, involving two or three standard limb leads and V2 \u2013V6, with reciprocal depressions only in aVR and sometimes V1. Also, there is depression in the PR segment below the TP segment, reflecting atrial involvement. Usually, there are no significant changes in QRS complexes unless a large pericardial effusion develops. After several days, the ST segments return to normal (stage 2), and only then, or even later, do the T waves become inverted (stage 3).
