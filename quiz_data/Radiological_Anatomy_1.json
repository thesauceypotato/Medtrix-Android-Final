Option C. Cerebellum can be involved in this in later courses due to metastasis but is very rare and usually does not involve it. Option D. external auditory meatus is not involved in this tumor. Hence it is not the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>A schwannoma (or neurilemmoma ) is a usually benign nerve sheath tumor composed of Schwann cells, which normally produce the insulating myelin sheath covering peripheral nerves. Schwannomas are homogeneous tumors, consisting only of Schwann cells. The tumor cells always stay on the outside of the nerve, but the tumor itself may either push the nerve aside and/or up against a bony structure (thereby possibly causing damage). Schwannomas are relatively slow-growing. For reasons not yet understood, schwannomas are mostly benign and less than 1% become malignant, degenerating into a form of cancer known as neurofibrosarcoma.</p>\n<p></p>",
