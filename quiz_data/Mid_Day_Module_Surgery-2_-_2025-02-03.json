Echinococcus granulosus , the causative agent of hydatid disease , has a life cycle that involves dogs (definitive host) and sheep (intermediate host). Humans become accidental intermediate hosts by ingesting ova through contaminated food, water, or direct contact with dog feces . Once ingested, the eggs hatch in the intestines, and the larvae can migrate through the portal vein (PV) to various organs, most commonly the liver, where they form hydatid cysts. This is considered a dead-end in the parasite's life cycle because humans are not a part of the natural transmission cycle.</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Man is the dead-end host, Option D: Echinococcus is causative.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is relatively rare in CD, compared with UC. Gallstones are common, as an inflamed or absent (because of resection) terminal ileum leads to reduced absorption of bile salts. Amyloidosis is common but is rarely symptomatic. Each patient with CD should have their disease phenotype (manifestations) classified according to the Montreal classification. This is important as it allows an overview of disease progression in the individual patient over time, and enables group comparisons and evaluations. The Montreal classification specifies age at diagnosis, behaviour and disease location. Perianal CD is distressing and often debilitating for patients. The most common presentation is with a perianal abscess : perianal swelling, redness and pain, followed by discharge of pus or fecal drainage to perianal skin or vagina, implying fistulae. Surgical resection will not cure CD. Surgery, therefore, focuses on managing the complications of the disease. The fundamental principle is to preserve a healthy gut and to maintain adequate function. Intestinal resection should be kept to the minimum required to treat the local consequences of disease to mitigate against the potential for short bowel syndrome .</li><li>\u27a4 The extraintestinal manifestations of CD are similar to those that occur in UC.

C) Adhesive obstruction - CECT abdomen</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Paralytic ileus - Put a NG tube. Paralytic ileus is characterized by decreased bowel motility without mechanical obstruction . Patients typically present with decreased or absent bowel sounds and lack of peristalsis . Inserting a nasogastric (NG) tube for decompression may be indicated to relieve abdominal distension and vomiting. However, in this case, the presence of a step ladder pattern of air-fluid levels on X-ray suggests a mechanical obstruction rather than paralytic ileus. Therefore, while NG tube placement can be part of supportive care, it does not address the underlying cause of the obstruction.</li><li>\u2022 Option A:</li><li>\u2022 Paralytic ileus - Put a NG tube.</li><li>\u2022 decreased bowel motility without mechanical obstruction</li><li>\u2022 decreased or absent bowel sounds and lack of peristalsis</li><li>\u2022 Option B: Paralytic ileus - CECT abdomen.

While adhesive obstruction may ultimately require surgical intervention , such as laparotomy , for definitive management , it is essential to first obtain imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the extent of the obstruction.
