      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>2,3,4. A cervical rib is a rib attached to vertebra C7. It occurs in about 5% of subjects and may lead to thoracic outlet syndrome. The cervical rib may exert traction on the lower trunk of the brachial plexus, which arches over a cervical rib. Such a person c omplains of paresthesia or abnormal sensations along the ulnar border of the forearm and wasting of the small muscles of the hand supplied by segment T1. Vascular changes may also occur, resulting in Raynaud's phenomenon. Compression of the sympathetic chain may cause Horner's syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The presence of a cervical rib can cause a form of thoracic outlet syndrome due to compression of the lower trunk of the brachial plexus or subclavian artery. These structures become infringed upon by the cervical rib and scalene muscles. Compression of the brachial plexus may be identified by weakness of the muscles in the hand near the base of the thumb.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. 1,2,3,4. Option B. 1,3,4. Option D. 2,3. Thenar muscles are supplied by the median nerve, not the ulnar nerve. In thoracic outlet syndrome, the median nerve is not involved.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Compression of the subclavian artery is often diagnosed by finding a positive Adson's sign on examination, where the radial pulse in the arm is lost during abduction and external rotation of the shoulder. A positive Adson's sign is non-specific for the presence of a cervical rib. However, many individuals without a cervical rib will have a positive test. Compression of the sympathetic chain may cause Horner's syndrome.</p>\n<p></p>",
