      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Retroperitoneal hematoma Introduction & the evolution of eFAST In emergency settings it is very important to have well-arranged processes with clear protocols to evaluate a patient adequately and quickly. Trauma ultrasound was utilized since the 1970s in Europe. The FAST protocol was utilized from the mid to late 90s. The addition of the detection of a pneumothorax was included in the eFAST protocol in 2004. The eFAST protocol is a useful tool where we use an ultrasound examination in a trauma setting to detect free fluid , in this case, bleeding. In detection of free intraperitoneal and intrathoracic fluid this protocol has a high specificity and sensitivity, both over 90%. In the detection of pleural effusion or hematothorax ultrasound can detect even the smallest amounts of fluid (20 ml) whereas you need 200ml to detect those pathologies with a chest X-Ray. The eFAST exam has largely replaced the peritoneal lavage as the primary method to detect free intraperitoneal fluid. Additionally it is possible to quickly detect a pneumothorax</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Indications & contraindications Traumatic injuries (blunt trauma, penetrating injury) - detection of free fluid inside The peritoneal spaces The pericardial space The pleural space Traumatic injuries to detect a pneumothorax There are no absolute contraindications for performing an eFAST exam on a patient, male or female, in an emergency setting. Acoustic windows: Five acoustic windows have to be evaluated in the setting of a supine patient: Right upper quadrant view: Detect free fluid surrounding the liver and the right kidney, focus on the hepatorenal recess, called Morison pouch. Detect free fluid in between the pleural space on the right side. Anterior thoracic view: Detect missing pleural sliding on the right and the left side of the thorax. [Pleural effusion, pneumothorax] Subcostal/subxiphoidal four chamber view: Detect free fluid inside the pericardial sac. [Cardiac tamponade] Left upper quadrant view: Detect free fluid surrounding the spleen and the left kidney including the splenorenal recess (Koller pouch).

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Focused assessment by sonogram in trauma Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) scan is a point-of-care ultrasound examination performed at the time of presentation of a trauma patient. It is invariably performed by a clinician, who should be formally trained, and is considered as an 'extension' of the trauma clinical assessment process, to aid rapid decision making. Some studies have shown no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between radiologists and non-radiologists 6. The chief aim of the study, in a trauma patient, is to identify intraperitoneal free fluid (assumed to be hemoperitoneum in the context of trauma) allowing for an immediate transfer to theater, CT or other. Solid organ injury is seldom identified, and when present may warrant further investigation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Traumatic injuries to detect a pneumothorax There are no absolute contraindications for performing an eFAST exam on a patient, male or female, in an emergency setting.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Bone marrow suppression occurs earlier than neurovascular effects Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) (sometimes known as radiation toxicity or radiation sickness) is an acute illness caused by irradiation of the entire body (or most of the body) by a high dose of penetrating radiation in a very short period of time (usually a matter of minutes). The major cause of this syndrome is depletion of immature parenchymal stem cells in specific tissues.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The required conditions for Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) are: The radiation dose must be large (i.e., greater than 0.7 Gray (Gy)1, 2 or 70 rads). The dose usually must be external ( i.e., the source of radiation is outside of the patient\u2019s body). The radiation must be penetrating (i.e., able to reach the internal organs). The entire body (or a significant portion of it) must have received the dose3. The dose must have been delivered in a short time (usually a matter of minutes).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- The three classic ARS Syndromes are: Option B. Bone marrow syndrome (sometimes referred to as hematopoietic syndrome) the full syndrome will usually occur with a dose between 0.7 and 10 Gy (70 \u2013 1000 rads) though mild symptoms may occur as low as 0.3 Gy or 30 rads. The survival rate of patients with this syndrome decreases with increasing dose. The primary cause of death is the destruction of the bone marrow, resulting in infection and hemorrhage . Option C.Gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome: the full syndrome will usually occur with a dose greater than approximately 10 Gy (1000 rads) although some symptoms may occur as low as 6 Gy or 600 rads. Survival is extremely unlikely with this syndrome. Destructive and irreparable changes in the GI tract and bone marrow usually cause infection, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. Death usually occurs within 2 weeks . Cardiovascular (CV)/ Central Nervous System (CNS) syndrome: the full syndrome will usually occur with a dose greater than approximately 50 Gy (5000 rads) although some symptoms may occur as low as 20 Gy or 2000 rads. Death occurs within 3 days. Death likely is due to collapse of the circulatory system as well as increased pressure in the confining cranial vault as the result of increased fluid content caused by edema, vasculitis, and meningitis. [Option A is correct] Option D. The four stages of ARS are: Prodromal stage (N-V-D stage): The classic symptoms for this stage are nausea, vomiting, as well as anorexia and possibly diarrhea (depending on dose), which occur from minutes to days following exposure. The symptoms may last (episodically) for minutes up to several days. Latent stage : In this stage, the patient looks and feels generally healthy for a few hours or even up to a few weeks. Manifest illness stage : In this stage the symptoms depend on the specific syndrome (see Table 1) and last from hours up to several months. Recovery or death : Most patients who do not recover will die within several months of exposure. The recovery process lasts from several weeks up to two years.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Patients with acute radiation syndrome (ARS) classically go through four clinical phases: prodrome, latency, manifest illness, and either recovery or death. During the prodromal phase, they usually present with nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and even loss of consciousness at higher doses.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Phases of Radiation Injury Dose  (Gy) Prodromal phase Manifest phase Prognosis without supportive care 0.5 -1.0 Mild Modest decline in blood counts Survival 1.0 -2.0 Mild - moderate Some bone marrow damage Survival > 90% 2.0 \u2013 3.5 Moderate Moderate \u2013 severe bone marrow damage Probable survival 3.5 -5.5 Severe Severe bone marrow damage; Modest GI damage Death within 3.5-6 Wk (50% of victims) 5.5 \u2013 7.5 Severe Pancytopenia and moderate GI damage Death probable within 2-3 wk 7.5 \u2013 10.0 Severe Severe GI and bone marrow damage Death probable within 2 wk 10 Severe Severe GI damage, radiation- induced lung injury, altered mental status; at higher doses (> 20.0 Gy), cardiovascular collapse, fever, shock Death within 2 wk</p>\n<p></p>",
