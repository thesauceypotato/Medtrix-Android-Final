      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Angiomyolipoma Renal Angiomyolipoma\u2019s (AMLs) Angiomyolipoma\u2019s are often found incidentally when the kidneys are imaged or as part of screening in patients with tuberous sclerosis . Symptomatic presentation is most frequently with spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage; Shock due to severe hemorrhage from rupture is described as Wunderlich syndrome. The cornerstone of diagnosis on all modalities is the demonstration of macroscopic fat . Ultrasound: Hyperechoic lesions located in the cortex and with posterior acoustic shadowing. CT: Most lesions involve the cortex and demonstrate macroscopic fat (less than \u201420 HU). Calcification is rare. MRI: Fat saturated techniques demonstrate high signal intensity on non-fat-saturated sequences, and loss of signal following fat saturation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Presence of fat is strongly indicative of an angiomyolipoma, but not pathognomonic (can be found in some other lesions) . Since macroscopic fat in RCC almost always occurs in the presence of ossification/ calcification, absence of ossification/calcification on imaging is in favor of AML. DSA-angiography: Angiomyolipoma\u2019s are hypervascular lesions and give \u201c sunburs t\u201d angiography or whorled \u201c onion peel \u201d appearance of peripheral vessels. Treatment: Angiomyolipoma\u2019s found incidentally usually require no therapy (when small). Larger AMLs (> 4cm), or those that have been symptomatic, can be electively embolized and/or resected with a partial nephrectomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option A - RCC - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a kidney cancer that originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule, a part of the very small tubes in the kidney that transport primary urine. RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, responsible for approximately 90\u201395% of cases. RCC occurrence shows a male predominance over women with a ratio of 1.5:1. RCC most commonly occurs between 6th and 7th decade of life. Historically, medical practitioners expected a person to present with three findings. This classic triad is 1: haematuria, which is when there is blood present in the urine, 2: flank pain, which is pain on the side of the body between the hip and ribs, and 3: an abdominal mass, similar to bloating but larger. It is now known that this classic triad of symptoms only occurs in 10\u201315% of cases, and is usually indicative that the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is in an advanced stage. Today, RCC is often asymptomatic (meaning few to no symptoms) and is generally detected incidentally when a person is being examined for other ailments. Option C - Hydatid cyst Cystic echinococcosis (CE), also known as hydatid disease, is caused by infection with the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, a ~2\u20137 millimeter long tapeworm found in dogs (definitive host) and sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs (intermediate hosts). Option D - Oncocytoma - Oncocytomas have classic gross features of a well-circumscribed tan or mahogany colored mass with a central stellate scar. Histologically they are classically well-circumscribed lesions with nested architecture, bland cytology, regular nuclei with prominent central nuclei, and eosinophilic cytoplasm.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Angiomyolipomas are the most common benign tumour of the kidney. Although regarded as benign, angiomyolipomas may grow such that kidney function is impaired or the blood vessels may dilate and burst, leading to bleeding. Angiomyolipomas are strongly associated with the genetic disease Tuberous Sclerosis, in which most individuals have several Angiomyolipomas affecting both kidneys. They are also commonly found in women with the rare lung disease lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Angiomyolipomas are less commonly found in the liver and rarely in other organs. Whether associated with these diseases or sporadic, Angiomyolipomas are caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which govern cell growth and proliferation. They are composed of blood vessels, smooth muscle cells, and fat cells.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Syndrome Chromosome Location Predisposing Gene Histology Frequency of Gene Mutations Germline (Ref.)
