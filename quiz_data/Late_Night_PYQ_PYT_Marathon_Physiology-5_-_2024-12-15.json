The left umbilical vein, which carries freshly oxygenated blood directly from the placenta, maintains the highest oxygen saturation (~80%) as it hasn't mixed with any systemic venous return yet. When ductus venosus flow is reversed, instead of the normal forward flow into the IVC, blood is shunted preferentially into the portal circulation. This reversal prevents the direct transfer of highly oxygenated blood to the IVC, making the umbilical vein the vessel with highest oxygen content.
