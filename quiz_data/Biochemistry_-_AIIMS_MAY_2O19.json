RNA \u2192 DNA \u2192 RNA \u2192 Protein This reversal of central dogma occurs in retro viruses. Retro viruses have their genome as RNA and because they have reverse transcriptase enzyme, which converts RNA to DNA. There is no link between these two processes. Both are independent phenomenon, but they can occur in same cell. For example, in retrovirus both processes happen but have no influence on each other.</p>\n<p></p>",

One genome is found in one region or organ(s), while the other genome can be predominant in other organs or tissues Chimerism testing (engraftment analysis) is performed for patients who have received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The test involves identifying the genetic profiles of the recipient and of the donor and then evaluating the extent of mixture in the recipient\u2019s blood or bone marrow. First, DNA is isolated from the recipient and potential donor before the transplant and analysis is performed to determine whether the genetic markers unique to the donor and the recipient have sufficient power to distinguish the donor from the recipient. Next, after the transplant takes place, the performance of the transplant engraftment is assessed by evaluating the donor versus recipient contribution of white blood cells in post-transplant blood or bone marrow specimens obtained from the recipient</p>\n<p></p>",

Hence, the best way to measure the catalytic efficiencies of different enzymes is to compare the ratio Kcat/Km for the two reactions.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Point mutation Sickle-cell anemia The occurrence of the disease sickle-cell anemia due to a single base alteration (CTC + CAC in DNA, and CAG + GUC in RNA) is a classic example of point mutations. The result is that glutamate at the 6th position of B-chain of haemoglobin is replaced by valine. This happens since the altered codon GUG of mRNA codes for valine instead of glutamate. Insertion Deletion If Not in the multiple of 3 then it will lead to shifting of the frame of codon called as frame shift. Other examples of point mutation: -</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Mitochondrial In all the offspring, mitochondria is derived only from mother. Hence, any mutation in mother mitochondria will also be transferred to its offsprings. So in mitochondrial gene inheritance if mother is affected all offspring will be affected.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- In case of X-linked disease there is no male to male transmission. In Y linked \u2013 father will transmit disease to all his sons. In autosomal inheritance, there is equal frequency of these disease in male and female Additional information: Mitochondrial disease has high incidence as mitochondrial DNA repair cannot occur, introns not present, and there is continuous exposure to the oxygen free radicals of ETC. Due to these few reasons mitochondrial DNA damage have more chances of mutations in mitochondrial DNA as compared to nuclear DNA.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Ferroportin Hepcidin Hepcidin regulates iron metabolism. It mainly regulates iron entry in circulation. By inhibiting ferroportin, hepcidin reduces dietary iron absorption. The iron release from macrophages is also reduced by ferroportin inhibition. So, increased hepcidin activity is responsible for reduced iron availability. Increased hepcidin will lead to anemia. Decreased hepcidin leads to iron overload Hepcidin synthesis and secretion by the liver is controlled by iron stores within macrophages, inflammation, hypoxia, and erythropoiesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Divalent metal transporter- absorbs divalent metal ions from intestine especially Ferrous.
