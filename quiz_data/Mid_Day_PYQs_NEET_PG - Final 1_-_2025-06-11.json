When extracellular K+ increases (hyperkalemia), the concentration gradient for K+ decreases, reducing K+ efflux from the cell. This causes the resting membrane potential to move closer to the threshold potential, making the neuron more excitable. In mild to moderate hyperkalemia, this decreased gradient leads to K+ accumulation inside cells, causing depolarization and increased excitability.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Decreasing extracellular Na+ Decreasing extracellular Na+ primarily reduces the frequency of the action potential but has minimal effect on the resting membrane potential. This occurs because Na+ permeability is relatively low at rest (0.04 compared to K+ at 1), so changes in Na+ concentration have little impact on excitability. Option B. Increasing extracellular Na+ The permeability of the membrane to Na+ at rest is relatively low, so increasing extracellular Na+ has little effect on the resting membrane potential or excitability. The RMP is primarily determined by K+ gradient since K+ has much higher permeability at rest. Option D. Increasing extracellular Cl- Increasing extracellular Cl- would push the membrane potential more negative (hyperpolarization) since Cl- influx has a hyperpolarizing effect.

Specifically, the middle fibers of the deltoid are powerful abductors of the arm at the shoulder joint. The deltoid is a triangular muscle that covers the shoulder joint and gives the shoulder its rounded contour. It is innervated by the axillary nerve (C5, C6). The multipennate arrangement of its acromial fibers allows for strong abduction force, making it the main muscle for this movement range.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option a) Supraspinatus - While controversial, the supraspinatus is traditionally thought to initiate abduction (0\u00b0-15\u00b0) rather than being the primary muscle for 15\u00b0-90\u00b0 abduction. It works synergistically with the deltoid throughout the range of motion.</li><li>\u2022 Option a) Supraspinatus</li><li>\u2022 Option b) Trapezius - The trapezius does not directly abduct the shoulder joint. Its role in shoulder abduction becomes important only beyond 90\u00b0 when it rotates the scapula to allow continued overhead movement.</li><li>\u2022 Option b) Trapezius</li><li>\u2022 Option d) Serratus Anterior - This muscle is responsible for protraction of the scapula and works with the trapezius for scapular rotation during overhead abduction (90\u00b0-180\u00b0), but is not the primary muscle for 15\u00b0-90\u00b0 glenohumeral abduction.</li><li>\u2022 Option d) Serratus Anterior</li><li>\u2022 Education Objective:</li><li>\u2022 Education Objective:</li><li>\u2022 The deltoid muscle is the principal abductor of the shoulder joint from 15\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, while complete overhead abduction (beyond 90\u00b0) requires coordinated action between the deltoid, trapezius, and serratus anterior. According to latest edition of Gray\u2019s Anatomy (0\u00b0-15\u00b0) is controversial. New updates are saying that (0\u00b0- 90\u00b0) movement is done by deltoid & supraspinatous both muscles.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

It selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels.
