      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hering\u2019s law of equal innervations of yoke muscles The primary deviation is the deviation of the affected eye when the unaffected eye is used for fixation. It is away from the action of paralysed muscle. The secondary deviation is the deviation of the unaffected eye seen under cover when the patient is made to fix the affected eye. The secondary deviation is much more than the primary deviation in paralytic squint based on Hering's law of equal innervations of yoke muscles.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Neurological control of ocular movements Laws governing the neural control of ocular movements Laws governing the neural control of ocular movements are as follows: The Hering law of equal innervation applies to both eyes. Equal and simultaneous innervation flows from the brain to a pair of synergistic (yoke) muscles which contract simultaneously inconjugate binocular movements . For example, in leftoversion, the lateral rectus of the left eye and medial rectus of the right eye receives an equal and simultaneous flow of innervation; during convergence, both medial recti; and so on. In the case of a paretic squint, the amount of innervation to both eyes is always determined by the fixating eye so that the angle of deviation will vary according to which eye is used for fixation Sherrington law of reciprocal innervation : During the initiation of an eye movement, increased innervation to an extraocular muscle is accompanied by simultaneous inhibition (a reciprocal decrease innervation) of the direct antagonist of the contracting muscle of the same eye. If the left medial rectus muscle receives innervation flow to initiate adduction of the left eye, there is simultaneous decrease and inhibitory flow to the left lateral rectus muscle to make it relax and enable the eyeball to move medially.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Sherrington\u2019s law of reciprocal innervations Sherrington (1906) described reciprocal innervation as the process that controls agonist and antagonist muscle actions. One muscle group (agonists) must relax to allow another group (antagonists) to contract. This is called reciprocal inhibition . Option: C. Donder\u2019s law The rule, known as Donders' law, states that for each gaze direction, there exists a single corresponding eye orientation irrespective of how the eye was brought to this position Option: D. Listing\u2019s law Listing's law states that, when the head is fixed, there is an eye position called primary position, such that the eye assumes only those orientations that can be reached from the primary position by a single rotation about an axis in a plane called Listing's plane .</p>\n<p></p>",

On adduction, there is a retraction of the globe and narrowing of the palpebral fissure while on attempted abduction there is a slight protrusion of the eyeball with the widening of the palpebral fissure.
