The enzyme 5-alpha reductase converts testosterone into DHT, which contributes to hair follicle miniaturization and hair loss in individuals with androgenic alopecia. Oral finasteride is a medication used to treat androgenic alopecia. It specifically inhibits the type II 5-alpha reductase enzyme, responsible for converting testosterone into DHT. By reducing DHT levels, finasteride helps slow down the miniaturization of hair follicles and promotes hair regrowth in some individuals with androgenic alopecia.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

Pop-off Valve: A safety feature that prevents the delivery of excessively high pressures which could damage the patient\u2019s lungs. Oxygen Inlet & Tubing: Connects the bag to an oxygen supply to deliver oxygen-enriched air to the patient. Reservoir Bag: Allows a reservoir of oxygen to be available for the patient to ensure the highest possible concentration of oxygen is delivered.

It is commonly seen in several skin conditions, such as psoriasis and chronic eczematous dermatitis. However, seborrheic keratosis is not associated with parakeratosis.

      "text": "A 55-year-old medical college principal is known for his strict adherence to rules and regulations. He recently denied several students the opportunity to appear for final exams because their attendance fell short by just 1% due to COVID-19, insisting that \"rules are rules.\" During the annual college festival, he is known to stop students from dancing exactly at 9 pm by personally standing on the dance floor and stopping everyone around him, as per the college rules. He is resistant to incorporating technological tools into teaching, claiming that reading from PowerPoint presentations in class has produced great doctors for decades. The principal also becomes irritable when students laugh during lectures, frequently threatening to mark them absent. Based on this description, which of the following personality disorders best fits the principal?",
