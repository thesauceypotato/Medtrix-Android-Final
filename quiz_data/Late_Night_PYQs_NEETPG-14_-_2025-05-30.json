C) Block release of acetylcholine from presynaptic terminal</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Botulinum toxin works by inhibiting the exocytosis of acetylcholine from presynaptic nerve terminals. In normal neurotransmission, acetylcholine is stored in vesicles in the presynaptic neuron and released when an action potential arrives.</li><li>\u2022 Botulinum toxin prevents the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft, effectively blocking neuromuscular transmission and causing flaccid paralysis.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Block postsynaptic receptors of acetylcholine:  Incorrect. Botulinum toxin doesn't affect postsynaptic receptors. Drugs that block postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors include anticholinergic agents like atropine (for muscarinic receptors) or agents like curare (for nicotinic receptors).</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Block postsynaptic receptors of acetylcholine:  Incorrect.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Inhibit reuptake of acetylcholine: Incorrect. Unlike noradrenaline or serotonin, acetylcholine's action is not terminated by reuptake into the presynaptic neuron. Instead, it is hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Inhibit reuptake of acetylcholine: Incorrect.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Inhibit acetylcholinesterase: Incorrect. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (like physostigmine, neostigmine, or pyridostigmine) increase acetylcholine levels by preventing its breakdown, resulting in enhanced cholinergic transmission. This mechanism is opposite to botulinum toxin's effect, which decreases cholinergic transmission.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
