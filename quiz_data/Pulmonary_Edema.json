      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pulmonary infection Germline mutation of MyD88 is associated with susceptibility to certain types of infections, particularly those caused by bacteria and fungi. Hence, Option C. Pulmonary infection is correct. MyD88 is a key component of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, which plays an essential role in innate immunity and the detection of pathogens. Mutations in MyD88 have been identified in individuals with increased susceptibility to infections such as pneumococcal disease, as well as in patients with certain immunodeficiency disorders.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Goodpasture syndrome: It is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects the kidneys and lungs. It is caused by autoantibodies that attack the basement membrane of these organs. Option: B. Pulmonary hypertension: It is a condition in which there is increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.It can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic mutations, but MyD88 mutations are not known to be associated with this condition. Option: D. Asthma: it is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that can cause wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. While asthma has a strong genetic component, MyD88 mutations are not known to be associated with this condition.</p>\n<p></p>",

S. aureus: While Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of healthcare-associated pneumonia, it is not a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Option: C. M. pneumoniae: It is an atypical bacteria that can cause pneumonia, but it is not the most common cause of CAP. It is more commonly associated with mild respiratory infections that do not require hospitalization, although severe cases can occur in certain populations, such as young children and immunocompromised individuals. Option: D. Klebsiella: Klebsiella pneumoniae is a gram-negative bacterium that is often associated with healthcare-associated pneumonia, particularly in people with underlying lung disease or who are immunocompromised.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Modified CURB-65 Blood Urea Nitrogen has been removed: So, no testing is required.
