This leads to abnormal movements, particularly in skilled movements. This, therefore, manifests as: unsteady gait which is called \u2018wide based\u2019 or \u2018drunken gait\u2019 Slurred speech called \u2018scanning speech\u2019 Nystagmus Disequilibrium Intentional tremor- Abnormalities of voluntary movements occur such as overshooting while reaching out for an object. This dysmetria promptly initiates a gross corrective action, but the correction overshoots to the other side, and the finger oscillates back and forth. This oscillation is called an intention tremor. Dysdiadochokinesia: Dysmetria leads to an inability to perform rapid movements called dysdiadochokinesia which results from the inability to promptly stop movement properly (rebound phenomenon). Decomposition of movement: These patients dissect complex movements and carry them out one joint at a time which is known as decomposition of movement. Hypotonia- Decreased tone of the musculature is due to loss of the deep cerebellar nuclei, particularly of the dentate and interposed nuclei, causing the decreased tone of the peripheral body musculature. Cerebellar infarcts and hemorrhages are relatively uncommon, accounting for less than 10% of all strokes. Hereditary and alcoholism are more common causes of isolated cerebellar dysfunction.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect Options:- Option: B. Medulla: Medullary syndromes are characterized by a wider variety of symptoms which include XII nerve palsy, hemiplegia, dysphagia, absence of gag reflex, and Horner\u2019s syndrome depending on the area of medulla involved. However, cerebellar symptoms can occur in Lateral Medullary syndrome where inferior cerebellar peduncles are involved. Since this question gives the history of ONLY cerebellar symptoms: cerebellum > Medulla. Option: C. Cortical motor strip: No hemiparesis or defect of higher CNS functions (speech, comprehension, personality, etc.) Option: D. Basal ganglia: Rigidity and resting tremors (not intention tremors unlike those described in the question) are characteristic features which are not given in the question.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Causes of cerebellar dysfunction include: Hereditary and degenerative diseases, Friedreich ataxia, and Machado-Joseph disease.

Hyperventilation- In NREM sleep, the respiratory rate primarily shows a slight decrement. In REM sleep, the respiratory rate, as well as tidal volume, becomes irregular but an overall decrease occurs in minute ventilation volume because both hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses decrease due to diminished sensitivity of chemoreceptors during sleep. Option: C. Slow but steady heart rate- heart rate is irregular during REM sleep due to intermittent rise in sympathetic activity. Option: D. High amplitude EEG waves- High amplitude slow waves occur in NREM sleep and rapid low amplitude waves occur in REM sleep.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>NORMAL SLEEP In a normal sleep cycle, a person passes through the four stages of slow wave sleep (NREM) before entering REM sleep- In a typical night of sleep, a young adult first enters non-REM sleep, passes through stages 1 and 2, and spends 70\u2013100 min in stages 3 and 4. Sleep then lightens, and a REM period follows. This cycle is repeated at intervals of about 90 min throughout the night. NREM sleep is characterized by decreases in muscle tone, heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, and metabolic rate. REM sleep is characterized by irregular heartbeats and respiration and by periods of atonia (loss of muscle tone). Brain activity during REM sleep is high and brain metabolism increases by more than 20% (Hence, called paradoxical sleep/desynchronized sleep). In addition, REM sleep, as the name implies, is characterized by rapid, rolling eye movements. Penile erection also occurs during REM sleep, a fact that is clinically important in determining whether a complaint of impotence has a physical or psychological basis. Physical causes mean that there is an underlying pathology (g., vascular, endocrine, post-trauma, iatrogenic damage) hence erection does not happen at all whereas, in psychological causes, REM erection does occur. REM is the active state of sleep in which dreaming occurs. (actually, dreaming occurs in both REM and NREM sleep but the dreams in REM sleep are more emotional and remembered whereas dreams in NREM sleep are not remembered). Hypoventilation is characteristic of both REM and NREM sleep because sleep depresses the central chemoreceptors (rising arterial and falling arterial  stimulate ventilation. Hypoxia acts through peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies, whereas  acts mainly through the central chemoreceptor in the medulla and also to an extent through the carotid body chemoreceptor).</p>\n<p></p>",

Upper motor neurons typically refer to corticospinal tract neurons that innervate spinal motor neurons, but they can also include brainstem neurons that control spinal motor neurons. Damage to these neurons initially causes muscles to become weak and flaccid but eventually leads to spasticity, hypertonia (increased resistance to passive movement), hyperactive stretch reflexes, and abnormal extensor plantar response (positive Babinski sign). The Babinski sign is dorsiflexion of the great toe and fanning of the other toes when the lateral aspect of the sole of the foot is scratched.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>In adults, the normal response to this stimulation is plantar flexion in all the toes. The Babinski sign is of value in the localization of disease processes, but its physiologic significance is unknown. In infants whose corticospinal tracts are not well developed, dorsiflexion of the great toe and fanning of the other toes is the natural response. In lesions of the precentral gyrus representing the leg region, the sign of Babinski, extensor response to a plantar stimulus is observed. The limb is kept in an extended position and some voluntary movement reappears. The patients are able to stand and walk, although their steps are small and hampered by the existing spasticity. In the case of damage to the precentral gyrus area representing the upper limb, the recovery of voluntary movement is often insufficient to allow the patient to grasp objects and use them properly. The Babinski sign, illustrated, is diagnostic of a lesion of the corticospinal tract. When the sole of the foot is stroked firmly along the path indicated, the normal response is flexion of the foot and toes. The Babinski sign is an extension of the big toe and fanning of the others.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Rest Options are inappropriate because characteristic Signs of pyramidal tract dysfunction include spasticity, weakness, slowing of rapid alternating movements, hyperreflexia, and a Babinski sign.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UPPER AND LOWER MOTOR NEURON INVOLVEMENT CLINICAL FEATURE UPPER MOTOR NEURON LOWER MOTOR NEURON Inspection Normal Wasted; Fasciculations(+) Q Tone Increased with Clonus Hypotonia; May be normal Pattern of weakness Preferentially affects extensors in arms, flexors in leg.

A large share of the EPSP is lost before it reaches the soma. The reason a large share is lost is that the dendrites are long, and their membranes are thin and at least partially permeable to potassium and chloride ions, making them leaky to an electric current.

This leads to abnormal movements, particularly in skilled movements. This, therefore, manifests as unsteady gait which is called \u2018wide based\u2019 or \u2018drunken gait\u2019 Slurred speech called \u2018scanning speech\u2019 Nystagmus Disequilibrium Intention tremor- Abnormalities of voluntary movements occur such as overshooting while reaching out for an object. This dysmetria promptly initiates a gross corrective action, but the correction overshoots to the other side, and the finger oscillates back and forth. This oscillation is called an intention tremor. Dysdiadochokinesia: Dysmetria leads to an inability to perform rapid movements called dysdiadochokinesia which results from the inability to promptly stop movement properly (rebound phenomenon). Decomposition of movement: These patients dissect complex movements and carry them out one joint at a time which is known as decomposition of movement. Hypotonia- Decreased tone of the musculature is due to loss of the deep cerebellar nuclei, particularly of the dentate and interposed nuclei, causes decreased tone of the peripheral body musculature Hereditary and alcoholism are more common causes of isolated cerebellar dysfunction. Causes of cerebellar dysfunction include: Hereditary and degenerative diseases Friedreich ataxia and Machado-Joseph disease. Acquired metabolic and nutritional disorders: This includes deficiency of Thiamine due to chronic alcohol abuse- Leads to degeneration of the spinocerebellum.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra continue to degenerate. Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that is caused by the degeneration of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra, which controls movement. These nerve cells die or become impaired, losing the ability to produce an important chemical called dopamine .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The major concern with levodopa is that chronic levodopa treatment is associated with the development of motor complications in the large majority of patients. These consist of fluctuations in motor response (\u201con\u201d episodes when the drug is working and \u201coff \u201d episodes when parkinsonian features return as the drug wears off) and involuntary movements known as dyskinesias, which typically complicate \u201con\u201d periods. When patients initially take levodopa, benefits are long-lasting (many hours) even though the drug has a relatively short half-life (60\u201390 min). Wearing-off occurs, in part, as a result of the short half-life of levodopa, which leads to fluctuations in plasma levodopa levels. With continued treatment, however, the duration of benefit following an individual dose becomes progressively shorter until it approaches the half-life of the drug. This loss of benefit is known as the wearing-off effect. Some patients may also experience a rapid and unpredictable switch from the \u201con\u201d to the \u201coff \u201d state known as the on-off phenomenon. Long-term double-blind studies show that the risk of developing motor complications can be minimized by using the lowest dose of levodopa that provides satisfactory benefit and through the use of polypharmacy to avoid the need for raising the dose of levodopa. The cause of levodopa-induced motor complications is not precisely known.</p>\n<p></p>",
