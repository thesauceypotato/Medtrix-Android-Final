      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Aspergillus Given image is Fungus cell wall In Aspergillus, the predominant cell wall components are polysaccharides synthesized by transmembrane synthases, transglycosidases and glycosyl hydrolases . The main core of A. fumigatus cell wall consists of a polymer of \u03b2-1,3-glucan and chitin which is responsible for the rigidity of this structure. Chitin: Chitin constitutes a much bigger fraction of the cell wall in filamentous fungi than in yeast, around 10\u201320% of the dry weight of cell walls. Polymers consisting mainly of unbranched chains of \u03b2-(1, 4) - linked-N-Acetylglucosamine in the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, or poly- \u03b2- (1, 4)- linked-N-Acetylglucosamine (Chitosan) in the Zygomycota. Both chitin and chitosan are synthesized and extruded at the plasma membrane Glucans: The other major cell wall component in fumigatus is \u03b2-1,3-glucan which is synthesized by a glucan synthase complex which contains two subunits, using UDP-glucose as a substrate. glucose polymers that function to cross-link chitin or chitosan polymers, \u03b2-glucans are glucose molecules linked via \u03b2- (1, 3) - or \u03b2- (1, 6) -bonds and provide rigidity to the cell wall while \u03b1-glucans are defied by \u03b1 -(1, 3) and function as part of the matrix. The catalytic subunit is encoded by FKS1 gene, the target of echinocandins drugs. This gene is unique but non-essential in fumigatus . Proteins: Enzymes necessary for cell wall synthesis and lysis in addition to structural proteins are all present in the cell wall. Most of the structural proteins found in the cell wall are glycosylated and contain mannose, thus these proteins are called mannoproteins or mannans. Option B - Mycoplasma  -  Mycoplasma is a genus of bacteria that, like the other members of the class Mollicutes, lack a cell wall around their cell membranes. Peptidoglycan is absent. This characteristic makes them naturally resistant to antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. They can be parasitic or saprotrophic. Option C - Mycobacterium  -  Mycobacteria are surrounded by a double membrane cell envelope that is exceedingly rich in lipids. No less than 60% of the mycobacterial cell envelope is estimated to be lipids as compared to 20% in the cell envelope of Gram-negative organisms Option D - Rhinosporidium - Rhinosporidium seeberi is a eukaryotic pathogen responsible for rhinosporidiosis, a disease which affects humans, horses, dogs, and to a lesser extent cattle, cats, foxes, and birds. It is most commonly found in tropical areas, especially India and Sri Lanka.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is typically seen with a history of warty lesion after wood prick. Chromoblastomycosis is also known as dematiaceous fungus or pigmented fungal disease because of these medlar bodies having a muriform cell appearance/ copper penny appearance. It is a chronic granulomatous infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by several different dematiaceous fungi and resulting in the formation of slow-growing warty plaques and cauliflower-like lesions which may ulcerate. The fungi produce thick-walled, single or multicellular clusters called sclerotic or muriform bodies, respectively. The fungi are usually introduced into the body by trauma, and the lesions are mostly found on exposed regions of the body. In the dermis, a granuloma composed of epithelioid cells and Langhans giant cells is visible. The fungal elements are visible as sclerotic bodies, which are brown septate cells. The sclerotic bodies (medlar bodies/ muriform bodies/copper pennies) are extruded transepidermally, and they appear as black dots on the surface of the lesion; this is characteristic of chromoblastomycosis The surface is scraped, and 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) is added to the scrapings, which the examiner then viewed under the microscope. The disease runs a chronic course and most cases can be cured.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A -  capsulated yeast - e.g. cryptococcus Cryptococcus is a genus of fungi in the family Cryptococcaceae that includes both yeasts and filamentous species.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hyperglycemia Plasmodium falciparum causes hypoglycemia, and not hyperglycemia. The most characteristic symptom of malaria is fever. Other common symptoms include chills, headache, myalgias, nausea, and vomiting. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cough are occasionally seen. As the disease progresses, some patients may develop the classic malaria paroxysm with bouts of illness alternating with symptom-free periods In all types of malaria the periodic febrile response is caused by rupture of mature schizonts. In P vivax and P ovale malaria, a brood of schizonts matures every 48 hr, so the periodicity of fever is tertian (\u201ctertian malaria\u201d), whereas in P malariae disease, fever occurs every 72 hours (\u201cquartan malaria\u201d). The fever in falciparum malaria may occur every 48 hr, but is usually irregular, showing no distinct periodicity. Splenomegaly is common but may not be apparent early in disease. Hepatomegaly, jaundice, hypotension and abdominal tenderness may also be seen. Malaria does not cause lymphadenopathy and is not associated with a rash. A variety of laboratory abnormalities may be seen in a case of uncomplicated malaria. These include normochromic, normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis or leukopenia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, elevated liver and renal function tests, proteinuria, and laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (although clinically important bleeding is rare). Eosinophilia is not seen. Patients with complicated malaria occasionally show evidence of massive intravascular hemolysis with hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - Malaria may result in not having enough red blood cells for an adequate supply of oxygen to your body's tissues (anemia). Low blood sugar. Severe forms of malaria can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), as can quinine \u2014 a common medication used to combat malaria. Very low blood sugar can result in coma or death. Option B - Kidney involvement by P. falciparum. AKI is a known complication of malaria and can occur in around 40% of patients with severe disease by P. falciparum in endemic regions, contributing to high mortality rate, around 75% of cases Option C - Hypoglycemia is a frequently encountered complication in falciparum malaria that is usually ascribed to increased glucose use and impaired glucose production caused by the inhibition of gluconeogenesis.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>IgG avidity assay help in distinguishing primary infection from past infection A positive test for CMV IgG indicates that a person was infected with CMV at some time during their life but does not indicate when a person was infected. This applies for persons \u226512 months of age when maternal antibodies are no longer present. IgG avidity assay helps in differentiating past and primary infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV). Avidity level measured by avidity index is used to describe the percentage of IgG bound to the antigen after being treated with denaturing agents. These assays are based on the fact that low avidity IgG antibodies are present during the first few months after the infection and avidity increases over time indicating maturation of the immune response. (Following primary CMV infection, IgG antibodies have low binding strength (low avidity) then over 2-4 months mature to high binding strength (high avidity). So the presence of high avidity IgG denotes a past infection rather than a primary one. This is because it persists for years in some individuals and is also produced during reactivation. However, in infants <3 months of age, transplacentally derived maternal IgG antibodies with high avidity index influenced IgG avidity result of the children. IgG antibodies are mostly maternally transferred antibodies, while the demonstration of IgM antibodies in the newborn is indicative of congenital infection, because maternal IgM antibodies can\u2019t be transplacentally acquired.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - Denotes only past CMV infection - this is not correct as it don\u2019t confirm about recent or past infection. A high level of IgG is not as important as a rising level. If there is a 4-fold increase in IgG between the first and second sample, then you have an active CMV infection (primary or reactivated). A positive CMV IgM and negative IgG means you may have very recently been infected. Option B - Chronic CMV infection, patient Is immune to other strains of CMV in future - this is completely wrong statement as the strains don\u2019t provide immunity to each other, The 11 species in this genus include human beta herpesvirus 5 (HCMV, human cytomegalovirus, HHV-5), which is the species that infects humans. Diseases associated with HHV-5 include mononucleosis and pneumonia. In the medical literature, most mentions of CMV without further specification refer implicitly to human CMV. Option C - not necessary to be in latency - chronic cases and cases with reminiscence may also present with positive IgG anti cmv.</p>\n<p></p>",
