For domestic purposes, a handgun with a fine nozzle is all necessary. For application on a large scale, power sprayers or \"aerosol\" dispensers are needed. Pyrethrum sprays are effective in reducing the number of mosquitoes. Reduction is only temporary due to the absence of residual effect, generally n for household purposes.

The technical product is a yellow or clear brown liquid with an unpleasant smell. Commercially, water-dispersible powders are available. Malathion is used in doses of 100-200 mg. per sq. ft., every three months. Because of its low toxicity, malathion has been recommended as an alternative insecticide to DDT. As a low-volume (ULV) spray, malathion has been widely used for killing adult mosquitoes to prevent or interrupt dengue-haemorrhagic fever and mosquito-borne encephalitis epidemics.</p>\n<p></p>",

Pyrethrum sprays are effective in reducing the number of mosquitoes. Reduction is only temporary due to the absence of residual effect, generally n for household purposes.
