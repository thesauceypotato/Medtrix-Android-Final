This patient has several atherosclerotic risk factors , including advanced age, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, which make thromboembolism secondary to carotid artery atherosclerosis the most likely cause of his symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Increased glycated haemoglobin concentrations are seen in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. This patient has a history of diabetes and is therefore at risk of diabetic retinopathy , a condition that can cause visual impairment and blindness. However, vision loss in diabetic retinopathy is typically bilateral and occurs over the course of many years, as opposed to the abrupt, unilateral vision loss seen in this patient. Direct fundoscopy in a patient with diabetic retinopathy shows microaneurysms, hard exudates, and macular edema (non-proliferative) or retinal neovascularization and vitreous haemorrhage (proliferative). Option: B. An optic tonometer is used to measure intraocular pressure (IOP) . Increased IOP is seen in patients with glaucoma and patients with increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Both of these conditions can lead to visual impairment. In particular, acute, closed-angle glaucoma can cause sudden-onset visual loss . However, it is typically painful and associated with headache and vomiting, none of which is seen in this patient. Direct fundoscopy in patients with increased ICP shows papilledema . Option: D. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a nonspecific inflammatory marker that can be increased in cases of infection, inflammation, or malignancy. Temporal arteritis can cause a significant elevation in ESR and is a rare etiology of central retinal artery occlusion, the most likely diagnosis in this patient. However, he lacks other symptoms of temporal arteritis ( e.g., headache, jaw claudication, constitutional symptoms). Moreover, a temporal artery biopsy , not ESR, is the gold standard for the diagnosis of temporal arteritis.</p>\n<p></p>",
