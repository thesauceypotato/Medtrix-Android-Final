Among the various human papillomavirus types, HPV-16 and HPV-18 are considered high-risk and are frequently implicated in the development of cervical, vaginal, and vulval cancers. Other high-risk types include HPV-31, HPV-33, and HPV-35. Genital warts , also known as condyloma acuminata or venereal warts, are most commonly caused by human papillomavirus 6 (HPV-6) and human papillomavirus 11 (HPV-11) .

The fall in 2, 3 DPG is less</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 The fall in 2, 3 DPG is less when the blood is stored in CPDA compared with ACD.</li><li>\u2022 The ease with which hemoglobin releases oxygen to the tissues is controlled by erythrocytic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) such that an increase in the concentration of 2,3-DPG decreases oxygen affinity and vice versa.</li><li>\u2022 In stored blood, the 2,3 DPG levels usually fall, thus less oxygen is released to the tissues. Therefore, its use in hypoxic patients (E.g., anemia) is limited.</li><li>\u2022 Phosphate-containing solution like CPDA (Citrate, phosphate, dextrose, adenine) prevents the fall in 2.3DPG levels. Higher 2,3 DPG concentration decreases affinity of Hb to the oxygen releasing oxygen to the tissues.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Decreased release of O2 : Incorrect. The goal of effective blood storage solutions like CPDA is to ensure that the oxygen release capacity is maintained, not decreased.

P50 is a measure of the oxygen tension at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated with oxygen. A higher P50, indicative of lower oxygen affinity, is preferable in stored blood as it means oxygen is more readily released to tissues\u2014a trait supported by higher 2,3-DPG levels.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. It has less P50</li><li>\u2022 Option D. It is less acidic : Incorrect. While pH maintenance is important in blood storage, the primary benefit of CPDA over ACD is not related to less acidity but to its inclusion of phosphate and adenine, which help sustain energy (ATP) production and 2,3-DPG levels in red blood cells.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. It is less acidic</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The use of CPDA in blood storage is superior to ACD due to its phosphate content, which helps maintain higher levels of 2,3-DPG in stored red blood cells. This biochemical preservation is crucial for ensuring that transfused blood can effectively release oxygen to hypoxic tissues, making CPDA the preferred choice in clinical settings where blood transfusions are necessary.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
