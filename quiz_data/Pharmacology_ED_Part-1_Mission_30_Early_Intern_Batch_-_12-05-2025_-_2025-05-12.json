Since adrenaline and histamine act on different receptors to produce opposite physiological effects, this option is not correct.</li><li>\u2022 B) Chemical Antagonism: This occurs when one drug directly reacts with another to neutralize its effects e.g. antacids neutralize gastric acid and protamine neutralize heparin. There is no direct chemical reaction between adrenaline and histamine, making this option incorrect.</li><li>\u2022 C) Physical Antagonism: This would imply that the drugs physically interfere with each other e.g. charcoal adbsorbs many drugs and is used in drug poisoning.</li><li>\u2022 D) Physiological Antagonism: This is the correct answer. Physiological antagonism occurs when two drugs produce opposite effects in the same physiological system. Adrenaline causes bronchodilation via beta-2 receptors, while histamine causes bronchoconstriction via H1 receptors. These drugs act on different receptor types but have opposite effects on the same physiological system, namely the bronchial smooth muscle.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Zavegepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist. It is used for the treatment of acute migraine attacks. CGRP is a neuropeptide that plays a role in the pathophysiology of migraines, and antagonists like Zavegepant block its activity, thereby alleviating symptoms.</li><li>\u2022 B) Pembrolizumab \u2013 Immune check point inhibitor used for endometrial carcinoma: This is also a correct match. Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets the PD-1 receptor.

Ertugliflozin is a Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which is used to manage blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus. It works by inhibiting the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, thereby leading to the excretion of glucose in the urine.</li><li>\u2022 D) Ivabradine \u2013 Funny current blocker for treatment of decreased visual acuity: This is the incorrect match. Ivabradine is indeed a \"funny\" current (If) blocker, but it is used for the treatment of certain types of chronic heart failure and angina pectoris (chest pain), not for treating decreased visual acuity.</li><li>\u2022 Therefore, option D is not a correct match concerning the mechanism of action and clinical use of the given drug.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires hepatic activation by cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP 2C19, to form its active metabolite. This active metabolite inhibits platelet aggregation and helps prevent further clot formation in patients at risk for stroke. However, some individuals have genetic variations that result in poor metabolism of clopidogrel by CYP 2C19, leading to reduced effectiveness of the drug. This phenomenon is known as clopidogrel resistance.

Decreased hepatocellular stores of glutathione</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver through a process that involves the formation of a toxic metabolite called N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Under normal circumstances, NAPQI is rapidly detoxified by glutathione, preventing liver damage. However, individuals with alcoholic cirrhosis often have reduced levels of glutathione in their hepatocytes (liver cells). This decreased glutathione availability impairs the detoxification of NAPQI, leading to an accumulation of the toxic metabolite in the liver. Consequently, the hepatocytes are more susceptible to damage and toxicity, even with lower doses of acetaminophen that would be well-tolerated by individuals with normal liver function. Factors such as decreased availability of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (choice A), decreased activity of Cytochrome P450 enzymes (choice C), or increased liver blood flow (choice D) may contribute to liver damage in other contexts or with different substances, but they are not the primary reasons for the increased sensitivity to acetaminophen's toxicity in individuals with alcoholic cirrhosis.</li><li>\u2022 Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver through a process that involves the formation of a toxic metabolite called N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI).
