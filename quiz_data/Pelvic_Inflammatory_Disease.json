These warts spread diffusely over the whole of the vulval area. The verrucous growths may appear discrete or coalesce to form large cauliflower-like growths. They affect the skin of the labia majora, perineum, perianal region, and vagina. Viral tests: DNA test, hybridization, PCR staining. CD4 count shows immune functioning. Colposcopic appearance: as patches of raised projection of acetowhite epithelium with a speckled appearance. Treatment: Young women with condyloma lata may be observed for 6 months , especially when it develops during pregnancy. Local application of podophyllin . This treatment is, however, contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy because the drug is absorbed into the circulation and is cytotoxic causing abortion and peripheral neuropathy. This treatment is also contraindicated in vaginal and cervical lesions because of severe inflammatory reactions provoked at these sites. The larger lesions are best removed by diathermy loop or laser ablation. The surgical excision of a localized growth is another alternative.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The husband should be treated simultaneously or protected from infection by advising the use of condoms.
