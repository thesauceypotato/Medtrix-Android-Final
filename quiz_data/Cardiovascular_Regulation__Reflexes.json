These receptors are primarily activated by a reduction in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), but they also respond to an increase in the arterial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and pH. When the intracranial pressure is increased, the blood supply to the brain is compromised and Local Hypercapnia activates central chemoreceptors located along the ventrolateral medullary surface. Their activation induces a rise in systemic arterial pressure (Cushing reflex) that tends to restore the blood flow to the brain.

The baroreceptors respond rapidly to changes in arterial pressure; in fact, the rate of impulse firing increases in a fraction of a second during each systole and decreases again during diastole. Furthermore, the baroreceptors respond much more to a rapidly changing pressure than to a stationary pressure.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Increase in blood pressure and increase in heart rate A typical reflex change in arterial pressure is caused by occluding the two common carotid arteries. This reduces the carotid sinus pressure; as a result, signals from the baroreceptors decrease and cause a less inhibitory effect on the vasomotor center.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The vasomotor centre then becomes much more active than usual, causing the aortic arterial pressure to rise and remain elevated during the 10 minutes that the carotids are occluded. It causes decreased parasympathetic innervation to the heart thus causing an increased heart rate. The increased sympathetic activity of the heart and blood vessels increases heart rate, contractility, and constricts arterioles. Removal of the occlusion allows the pressure in the carotid sinuses to rise, and the carotid sinus reflex now causes the aortic pressure to fall immediately to slightly below normal as a momentary overcompensation and then return to normal in another minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Rest options are incorrect because The increase in blood pressure is due to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which causes vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels and an increase in cardiac output. The increase in heart rate is also due to sympathetic activation, which leads to an increase in the firing rate of the sinoatrial node, the heart's natural pacemaker.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries at their origin may even occur in cases presenting with Takayasu's arteritis.</p>\n<p></p>",

These are located in the right and left atria. They sense intravascular volume (atrial stretch or preload) Afferent fibers go to the cortex and hypothalamus. Stretch causes a decrease in BP and ADH release. Stretch also releases ANP which decreases Renin and Aldosterone release. The discharge of type B baroreceptors is increased when venous return is increased and decreased by positive-pressure breathing, indicating that these baroreceptors respond primarily to distension of the atrial walls.
