      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Microscopic agglutination test THE HISTORY SUGGESTS leptospirosis which is commonly associated with sewage workers. Rodents are the most important reservoir- rats commonest worldwide source. Transmission occurs when people come into contact with infected animal urine, g. canoeing, swimming in lakes and rivers, farming, Sewage exposure. It is primarily a disease of tropical and subtropical regions, and infection in temperate regions is uncommon. Serology-the mainstay of diagnosis. Commercial tests using genus specific antigens are used to screen sera, and positive reactions confirmed in a reference laboratory using the micro- agglutination test (MAT) with live Leptospira (killed have lower sensitivity). The MAT detects agglutinating antibodies in patient serum and is relatively serovar- specific, so a large number of antigens must be tested.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A: WEIL FELIX IS USED FOR RICKETTSIAL DISEASES Option B : IS USED FOR DIAGNOSING INFECTIOUS MONONUCLEOSIS.

The other options are incorrect.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Cutaneous leishmaniasis is also widely distributed. The classic form of Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis, the oriental sore, is found in the Middle East, the Mediterranean, Africa, India, and Asia. It is caused by major, L. tropica, Leishmania aethiopica , and occasionally by L. donovani and L. infantum. New World cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in Latin America. It is caused by Leishmania brazilensis, Leishmania mexicana Leishmania panamensis, and occasionally by L. chagasi. Incubation period 2 weeks- few months. A wide variety of skin lesions may occur, from small, dry, crusted lesions (usually L. tropica) to large, deep ulcers with a granulating base and overlying exudate (usually L. braziliensis). Lesions may be single or multiple and tend to occur on exposed areas. LD BODY: The LD bodies, of size 2-4u, consisted of a nucleus and a smaller kinetoplast, were present within macrophages and occasionally extracellularly.</p>\n<p></p>",
