      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Post dislocation The most likely diagnosis is posterior hip dislocation Here, patient has presented with flexion, adduction and medial rotation of the affected limb along with obvious shortening, which points to the diagnosis of posterior dislocation of hip. In approximately 90% of hip dislocation patients, the thighbone is pushed out of the socket in a backwards direction. This is called a posterior dislocation. A posterior dislocation leaves the lower leg in a fixed position, with the knee and foot rotated in toward the middle of the body. Motor vehicle collisions are the most common cause of traumatic hip dislocations. The dislocation often occurs when the knee hits the dashboard in a collision. This force drives the thigh backwards, which drives the ball head of the femur out of the hip socket. (Left) This x-ray, taken from the front, shows a patient with a posterior dislocation of the left hip. (Right) Normal alignment after the hip has been reduced. COMPLICATIONS: As the thighbone is pushed out of the socket, particularly in posterior dislocations, it can crush and stretch nerves in the hip. The sciatic nerve, which extends from the lower back down the back of the legs, is the nerve most commonly affected. When blood supply to the bone is lost, the bone can die, resulting in osteonecrosis. The protective cartilage covering the bone may also be damaged, which increases the risk of developing arthritis in the joint. Category Characteristic Significance Extracapsular Intertrochanteric Subtrochanteric Large amount of cancellous bone and good blood supply Typically heals well, although subtrochanteric has higher rate of impact device failure Intracapsular Femoral head Femoral neck Little cancellous bone and relatively poor blood supply Higher incidence of avascular necrosis, nonunion, malunion, and degenerative changes</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. ANTERIOR HIP DISLOCATION It is less common than the posterior hip dislocations and accounts for about 10-20% of all hip dislocations. This injury is usually sustained following a high energy accident. The affected limb in this condition will be abducted,externally rotated and slightly flexed Option B. Transcervical fracture: It is a type of fracture neck of the femur where the fracture line is in the middle of the neck. In this case,there can be shortening and external rotation of the affected limb Option D. Intertrochanteric fracture: It is usually sustained following a fall or road traffic accident. The leg is short and externally rotated. Clinical findings are more marked than the neck of femur fractures.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>FINDINGS OF HIP DISLOCATION: loss of congruence of femoral head with acetabulum disruption of shenton's line: arc along inferior femoral neck + superior obturator foramen anterior dislocation femoral head appears larger than contralateral femoral head femoral head is medial or inferior to acetabulum posterior dislocation femoral head appears smaller than contralateral femoral head femoral head superimposes roof of acetabulum decreased visualization of lesser trochanter due to internal rotation of femur</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Anterior dislocation POSTERIOR DISLOCATION PREVALENCE LESS COMMON MOST COMMON TYPE OF INJURY DECELERATION INJURY/FALL FROM HEIGHT DASHBOARD INJURY ATTITUDE OF THE LIMB FLEXION,ABDUCTION,EXTERNAL ROTATION(FABER) FLEXION,ADDUCTION,INTERNAL ROTATION(FADIR) LENGTH OF THE LIMB LENGTHENED SHORTENED RADIOLOGICAL FINDINGS Femoral head maybe seen inferior to the acetabulum,appears larger than normal, lesser trochanter is prominent Femoral head is displaced superiorly and laterally Femoral head appear smaller than normal Lesser trochanter is not visualised NERVE INJURED Femoral nerve sciatic nerve</p>\n<p></p>",

It tests the abductor pollicis brevis muscle which is supplied by the median nerve.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The clinical examination of the median nerve involves: Motor exam: - lesions at the wrist (carpal tunnel) - pen-touching test. The patient lies his hand flat on a table with his palm facing upwards. The patient is asked to abduct his thumb to touch the examiner's pen which is held above it. This test is for the function of abductor pollicis brevis - one of the LOAF muscles supplied by the median nerve in the hand. LOAF is a mnemonic for the lateral two lumbricals, opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis and flexor pollicis muscles. Sensory exam: - test pin prick over the palmar aspect of the index finger - supplies the palmar aspect of the thumb, index, middle, and lateral half of ring fingers.

When this is done the index and the middle finger fail to flex due to loss of action of long flexors which are supplied by the median nerve. Benediction test: Due to loss of activity of the long flexor the patient is unable to flex the index and middle finger on lifting the hand. As this is the position a clergyman uses to bless the couple during the marriage it is called the benediction test.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A,C and D is not the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA UPPER LIMB NERVE INTEGRITY TEST NERVE TEST MUSCLE MEDIAN NERVE 1.
