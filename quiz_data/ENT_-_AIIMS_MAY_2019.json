B/L hearing loss All of these are characteristic features of Otosclerosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Otosclerosis is a condition where one or more foci of irregularly laid spongy bone replace part of normally dense enchondral layer of bony otic capsule in the bony labyrinth. Symptom onset usually occurs by the early third decade of life, but onset is not unusual in later years. Symptoms include slowly progressive hearing loss, which is bilateral in 70% of cases. Vertigo is uncommon. Tinnitus may be present and often resolves after successful surgical management. Otosclerosis is often associated with osteogenesis imperfecta (van der Hoeve syndrome) in a classic triad of hearing loss (conductive, mixed, or sensorineural), spontaneous bone fractures, and blue sclera.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A - M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease, also called endolymphatic hydrops, is a disorder of the inner ear where the endolymphatic system is distended with endolymph.
