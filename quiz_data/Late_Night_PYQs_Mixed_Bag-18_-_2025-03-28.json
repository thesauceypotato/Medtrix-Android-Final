Tc Sestamibi Scan</li><li>\u2022 Option C. USG (Ultrasound): Ultrasound is useful for imaging the parathyroid glands due to its non-invasive nature and ability to detect lesions in real-time.

However, its effectiveness diminishes for ectopic glands or in obese patients where acoustic windows may be poor.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. USG (Ultrasound):</li><li>\u2022 Option D. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging): MRI can provide detailed images and is useful in complex cases, such as when other imaging modalities fail or in surgical planning.
