During collecting the firearm from the crime scene, look for the location it is found, type, and initials on the butt- this is a correct statement. The firearm should be looked for all these things while collected in a paper and afterwards sent to the laboratory. At the crime scene, photographs should be taken before any item is moved from various angles to show the position of various items. Photographs should also be taken of single items when they are moved. Hence option A is incorrect.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Gun from the victim's hand should be collected with the help of a piece of paper and not bare hands as fingerprints will get imprinted on this. Option: D. Empty cartridges, shells, wads everything found at the scene of the crime should be collected.</p>\n<p></p>",

In the given question, the image depicts an altered shape of the bullet after being fired from the firearm and penetrating the body. The shape appears like that of a mushroom, hence it is named a mushroom bullet.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Frangible bullet- the bullet entering the body is broken up into several fragments and each part produces injury to the body. Option: B. Tandem bullet- when the entry track shows more than one bullet, but the shape is not altered. This is important wrt to the old unused firearm. Option: C. Ricochet bullet- the bullet after being fired from the gun gets deflected due to some obstacle is ricochet bullet.</p>\n<p></p>",
