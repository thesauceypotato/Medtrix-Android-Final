The presentation is typical with painless, progressive unilateral obstructive symptoms with or without epistaxis , rhinorrhea and chronic otomastoiditis due to obstruction of the Eustachian tube . Patients may present with life-threatening epistaxis. On examination, it may be seen as a pale reddish-blue mass. It is, as the name suggests, very vascular and a biopsy can sometimes be fatal. Histopathology reveals a fibrocellular stroma with spindle cells and haphazard arrangement of collagen interspersed with an irregular vascular pattern. On imaging, they present as a vividly enhancing soft-tissue masses centered on the sphenopalatine foramen . Given its vascularity, prominent flow voids are seen on MRI leading to a salt and pepper appearance.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: Nasal polyps are Non-neoplastic masses of oedematous nasal or sinus mucosa. Option B: Rhinosporidiosis is a rare, infectious, chronic granulomatous disease  of the mucous membranes caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi, an endo sporulating microorganism. It usually manifests as vascular friable polyps that arise from the nasal mucosa or external structures of the eye. This appearance results from sporangia, which are visible as gray or yellow spots in the vascular polypoid masses. Option C: An inverted papilloma, also known as transitional papilloma, Ringertz tumour or Schneiderian papilloma, is a type of tumor in which surface epithelial cells grow downward into the underlying supportive tissue. Clinical features depend mainly on the anatomic site of its occurrence, and unilateral nasal obstruction represents the most frequent symptom.It tends to present in the fifth to seventh decades of life</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>TYPES: Type I includes lesions fundamentally localized to the nasal cavity, paranasal sinus, nasopharynx, or pterygopalatine fossa.

Type III is a calabash-like massive tumor lobe in the middle cranial fossa.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Serous Otitis Media Acute suppurative otitis media (ASOM) is an acute, suppurative infectious process marked by the presence of infected middle ear fluid and inflammation of the mucosa lining the middle ear space. The infection is most frequently precipitated by impaired function of the Eustachian tube, resulting in the retention and suppuration of retained secretions. ASOM may also be associated with purulent otorrhea if there is a ruptured tympanic membrane. ASOM usually responds promptly to antimicrobial therapy. It is often characterized by hearing loss and a sense aural fullness. Otoscopy reveals the presence of middle ear fluid without a bulging tympanic membrane or evidence of active infection. The tympanic membrane is intact and may or may not be retracted, depending on the chronicity of the effusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>STAGES OF ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA Stage 1: HYPEREMIA Stage 2: EXUDATION Stage 3: SUPPURATION Stage 4: COALESCENCE Stage 5: COMPLICATIONS</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B: Bullous myringitis (BM) is a relatively common infectious condition characterized by bullae or vesicles on the tympanic membrane (TM), without affecting the contents of the external or middle ear. If the middle ear becomes involved, this would be consistent with acute otitis media (AOM) and not merely bullous myringitis. As the tympanic membrane is well innervated, moderate to severe pain is a common expected manifestation. Physical findings may be similar to those of acute otitis media, including erythema and thickening of the tympanic membrane, attenuated or absent light reflex, and decrease membrane mobility. Bloody otorrhea can occur when a bulla ruptures and is referred to as bullous hemorrhagic myringitis. The rupturing of bulla often results in a concomitant reduction of pain. The vesicles occur between the outer epithelium and the lamina propria of the tympanic membrane Option C: Pneumotympanum may occur following temporal bone fracture and does not present with the typical picture of suppuration. Option D: Tuberculous otitis media (TOM) is a rare cause of chronic suppurative infection of the middle ear and mastoid. Patients typically have a chronic tympanic membrane perforation and ear drainage associated with progressive and profound hearing loss. The correct diagnosis starts with consideration of the disease in a patient with a chronic middle ear infection that is unresponsive to routine therapy. Classic presentations of tuberculous otitis media include painless otorrhea, multiple perforations of the tympanic membrane, beefy red granulation tissue, hearing loss, preauricular adenopathy, and an ipsilateral facial nerve palsy. OM should be strongly considered in patients with known or suspected tuberculosis and a chronic ear infection; however, the lack of evidence of tuberculosis elsewhere does not exclude the possibility of TOM. Appropriate evaluation for TOM includes a chest film, purified protein derivative (PPD) skin testing, and smears or cultures of otic secretions for mycobacteria.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Oval Window Figure below shows Tuning curves for primary afferents at different locations on the cochlea . Afferents from inner hair cells near the apex show a maximum sensitivity (lowest threshold) to sounds with low frequencies (black curve). Primary afferents from inner hair cells near the base show maximum sensitivity to higher frequencies (curve on far right) . Cells in between show intermediate behavior (middle two curves) . The sensitivity falls off sharply at higher frequencies, but lower frequencies can still excite the afferents off their maximum sensitivity. Thus, in a scenario where there i s high frequency hearing loss due to damage to the basilar membrane and structure closest to it, the most probable structure injured along with basilar membrane is the oval window.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The middle ear ossicles transmit sound-related vibratory energy from the eardrum to the oval window, where vibrations are set up in the fluid media of the cochlea. The organ of Corti, located on the upper surface of the basilar membrane of the cochlea, contains specialized hair cells that act as the neural transducers in this system. The basilar membrane is a stiff structural element within the cochlea of the inner ear which separates two liquid-filled tubes that run along the coil of the cochlea, the scala media and the scala tympani. Oscillations of the basilar membrane produce an activating shearing force on the cilia of the hair cells.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - helicotrema - The helicotrema is the most apical portion of the cochlea and is defined as the region where the scala tympani and scala vestibuli meet at the end of the BM. Option C. Stria Vascularis - The stria vascularis, composed of marginal, intermediate, and basal cells, is responsible for maintaining the ion composition of the endolymph and producing an endocochlear potential (EP) in the scala media Option D. Semi Circular Canal - Located in the inner ear, the semicircular canals are three very small tubes whose primary job is to regulate balance and sense head position. They're considered part of the vestibular apparatus of the body.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The mechanical properties of the basilar membrane are such that high-frequency sounds cause oscillations at the base of the membrane, near the oval window, whereas low-frequency sounds cause oscillations at the apex. This imparts tonotopic organization to the hair cells along the organ of Corti. Cells at the apex encode low-frequency sounds, and cells at the base, high-frequency sounds.</p>\n<p></p>",
