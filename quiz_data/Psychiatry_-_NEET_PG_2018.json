      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Temper tantrums Habit disorders are stereotyped behaviors that are intentionally and repetitively produced but serve no constructive or socially acceptable function. The common habit disorders include thumb sucking, nail biting, pulling out of hair (trichotillomania), head banging, masturbation, teeth grinding, picking of nose, biting parts of the body, skin-scratching, body rocking, breath-holding, and swallowing of air (aerophagia).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Habit disorders can range from normal to abnormal based on the severity and developmental period. Temper tantrums are episodic, disruptive behaviors that occur in response to frustration or anger, typically observed in young children. They are not repetitive behaviors like habit disorders.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: Thumb sucking - Thumb sucking is a common habit disorder, often seen in infants and young children. Option B: Nail biting - Nail biting is also a common habit disorder and can occur due to anxiety or boredom. Option D: Tics - Tics are involuntary, sudden, repetitive movements or vocalizations. They are not considered typically as habit disorders, but tics are sometimes under partial control and while choosing the single best answer, we can rule out this.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Some habit disorders, particularly self-stimulating habits, have been considered as gratification habits or masturbatory equivalents. Habit disorders are more common in individuals with mental retardation or learning disabilities. Treatment for habit disorders involves behavior modification techniques and addressing any underlying psychopathology, if present.</p>\n<p></p>",

The Semen Squeeze Technique is not employed to treat oligospermia.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The exercise program eventually raises the threshold of the sensation of ejaculatory inevitability and allows the man to focus on sensations of arousal without anxiety and develop confidence in his sexual performance.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Correlation Freud's theory of dream interpretation includes several mechanisms that modify the dream content. These mechanisms are as follows: Symbolism: Dreams often use symbols to represent unconscious desires or conflicts. Displacement: Emotions or desires are transferred from their original source to a more acceptable or less threatening object or person in the dream. Condensation: Multiple thoughts, emotions, or ideas are combined or condensed into a single dream image or event. Projection: Unconscious thoughts, feelings, or desires are attributed to another person or object in the dream. Secondary elaboration: Dream content is further modified through the introduction of logical thinking or secondary process thinking. The option \"Correlation\" is not a part of Freud's theory of dreams.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Freud considered dreams as expressions of unconscious fantasies or impulses that are not easily accessible in wakefulness. Dream work involves modifying the dream content to preserve sleep and provide wish fulfillment. The latent dream content represents unconscious forbidden fantasies, while the manifest dream content is the modified dream content produced by dream work. Dream interpretation aims to understand the true meaning of the dream by accessing the latent dream content through free association.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Freud believed that dreams provided a glimpse into the unconscious mind and could reveal repressed desires or unresolved conflicts. The interpretation of dreams was a significant aspect of psychoanalysis, allowing the analyst to uncover unconscious motivations and gain insight into the patient's psyche.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Delirium tremens Delirium tremens (DT) is the most severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, occurring typically within 2-4 days of complete or significant abstinence from heavy alcohol drinking, affecting around 5% of patients. Visual and auditory hallucinations and illusions are common, often vivid and frightening. Tactile hallucinations of insects crawling over the body may also occur. Marked autonomic disturbance is observed, presenting with tachycardia, fever, hypertension, sweating, and pupillary dilatation. Other features include psychomotor agitation, ataxia, insomnia with a reversal of sleep-wake pattern, and dehydration with electrolyte imbalance.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Korsakoff psychosis: Korsakoff psychosis is associated with thiamine deficiency and is characterized by anterograde amnesia, confabulation, and impaired executive functions. It is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. Option C. Post-acute withdrawal syndrome: Post-acute withdrawal syndrome refers to a cluster of symptoms, including mood swings, cravings, and cognitive difficulties, that can persist for weeks or months after the acute withdrawal phase. The symptoms in the given case are more consistent with delirium tremens. Option D. Discontinuation syndrome: Discontinuation syndrome refers to the symptoms that occur upon abrupt discontinuation of certain medications, such as antidepressants or benzodiazepines. It is not applicable to the given case.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Treatment of delirium tremens often involves supportive care, benzodiazepines for symptom control, and management of associated medical conditions. Thiamine administration is essential in alcohol withdrawal to prevent Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Long-term management of alcohol use disorder involves psychosocial interventions, medications (such as naltrexone, acamprosate, or disulfiram), and support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Confusion Delirium and dementia are both cognitive disorders, but they differ in several key aspects. The differentiating factor between delirium and dementia is confusion. Delirium is characterized by acute onset confusion, clouding of consciousness, decreased awareness of surroundings, and decreased ability to respond to environmental stimuli. On the other hand, dementia is characterized by chronic memory loss and cognitive decline without an acute onset or fluctuating course.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>A comparison of delirium and dementia Features Delirium Dementia 1.
