As a result, most complications result from fracture, deformity, functional impairment, and pain. [2] Disease occurs along a broad clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic, incidental lesions, to severe disabling disease. Disease can affect one bone (monostotic), multiple (polyostotic), or all bones (panostotic) and may occur in isolation or in combination with caf\u00e9 au lait skin macules and hyperfunctioning endocrinopathies, termed McCune\u2013Albright syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Putty kidney The \u201cputty kidney\u201d or \u201cautonephrectomy\u201d is the end result of scarring, obstruction, and atrophy of the kidney due to TB which is complicated by dystrophic calcification with time</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Putty kidney refers to a pattern of renal calcification associated with renal tuberculosis conventionally described on plain radiography. The calcification can be large, round or oval, dense or very homogeneous and ground glass-like, representing calcified caseous tissue within dilated calyces. This condition is due to the superimposition of ureteral obstruction on renal parenchymal tuberculosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B. Staghorn Calculus; A staghorn calculus, a type of kidney stone with branches, happens in some cases because of repeated infections. The branches can block urine from leaving the kidney, causing kidney failure. Option C. Psoas muscle calcification ; Psoas abscess is a collection of pus located in the iliopsoas muscle compartment. It can occur either via contiguous or hematogenous spread from distant sites. Option D. Hydronephrosis; Hydronephrosis is swelling of one or both kidneys. Kidney swelling happens when urine can't drain from a kidney and builds up in the kidney as a result. This can occur from a blockage in the tubes that drain urine from the kidneys (ureters) or from an anatomical defect that doesn't allow urine to drain properly.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
