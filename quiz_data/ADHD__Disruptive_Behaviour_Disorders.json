In the early stages of adolescence (onset between ages 10-14), individuals can experience negative feelings about their self-image , largely due to changes in their bodies and/or social pressure. Irritability (e.g., losing one's temper), mood swings , hypersomnia, fatigue, and infrequently skipping school , all of which are seen in this 14-year-old adolescent, are considered normal as long as they do not cause significant distress or functional impairment.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option:A. Symptoms of Premenstrual syndrome occur before menstruation and must be associated with significant distress or interference with usual activities (e.g., work, school, and social life). In this patient, there does not seem to be a relationship between symptom expression and menstruation. Option: B. Body dysmorphic disorder often includes camouflaging of disliked body parts . However, it typically also involves a preoccupation with a specific aspect of one's physical appearance, self-injurious behavior, and social withdrawal, all of which are not present in this patient. Option: D. Bipolar disorder has symptoms of depression or hypomania or mania , which are not seen in this patient.</p>\n<p></p>",
