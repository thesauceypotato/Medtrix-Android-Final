Salmonella enteritidis - Most persons infected with Salmonella bacteria develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection Staph aureus - Staph food poisoning is characterized by a sudden start of nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps. Most people also have diarrhea. Symptoms usually develop within 30 minutes to 8 hours after eating or drinking an item containing Staph toxin, and last no longer than 1 day. Clostridium Botulinum - In food-borne botulism, signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea followed by constipation and abdominal distention. There may be weakness and difficulty breathing. Symptoms normally appear between 18 and 36 hours after consuming the contaminated food, but this can vary between 3 hours and 8 days Clostridium perfringens - Symptoms of perfringens food poisoning include intense abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea. Your symptoms usually appear 6 to 24 hours after eating foods containing large numbers of C. perfringens . The disease usually is over within 24 hours. Less severe symptoms may last for 1 or 2 weeks Right answer in this context would be staphylococcus aureus food poisoning as symptoms develops within 3-4 hrs</p>\n<p></p>",

Monovalent C meningococcal vaccine is recommended for all children at one year of age as part of routine immunization and for people who have had meningococcal disease. Infants aged 2\u201311 months are given 2 doses with at least 2 months between the doses, followed by a booster dose about one year later. A single dose of monovalent A meningococcal vaccine is licensed for individuals 1\u201329 years of age. Combined haemophilus influenzae type B (HIB) plus monovalent C meningococcal vaccine. It is recommended that 3 doses administered at 2, 4 and 6 months of age should be followed by a booster at 12\u201315 months of age. Quadrivalent (A, C, Y and W135), which has been licensed since 2005 for use in children and adults in some countries in the world. This vaccine is initially administered as one dose only and is licensed for individuals 2\u201355 years of age. A two-dose series of this vaccine is licensed for use in children aged 9\u201323 months. Polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine This is recommended for some specific risk groups and for the control of meningococcal outbreaks, and is available in different forms. Bivalent: protects against groups A and C. This form is administered as a single dose to persons \u2265 2 years old, which provides protection for 2\u20133 years. A second single dose is administered for school children and adults, which provides protection for at least 3 years. After 3\u20135 years, one booster dose may be given to persons considered to be at continued risk of exposure including health workers. Trivalent: protects against groups A, C and W-135 Tetravalent: protects against groups A, C, Y and W-135. This form is recommended for travelers to countries where there are epidemics of meningococcal disease (eg. sub-Saharan Africa and people travelling to perform Hajj in Saudi Arabia). These vaccines do not protect against meningococcal groups B and X. Serogroup B vaccines have been extracted from selected outbreak strains and are currently used in some countries to limit outbreaks.</p>\n<p></p>",
