The examiner depresses the tongue with a tongue depressor and introduces a posterior rhinoscopic mirror, which has been warmed and tested on the back of the hand. The mirror is held like a pen and carried behind the soft palate. Without touching it on the posterior third of the tongue to avoid a gag reflex, light from the head mirror is focussed on the rhinoscopic mirror which further illuminates the part to be examined. The patient\u2019s relaxation is important so that the soft palate does not contract. Technique of posterior rhinoscopy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- O ption A. Examine the skin and osteocartilaginous framework of the nose both by inspection and palpation. Skin is examined for signs of inflammation (furuncle, septal abscess), scars (operation or trauma), sinus (congenital dermoid), swelling (dermoid or glioma) or a neoplasm (basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma). The osteocartilaginous framework is examined for deformity, e. g. deviated or twisted nose, hump, depressed bridge, bifid or pointed tip, and destruction of the nose (trauma, syphilis, cancer). O ption B. Vestibule -It is the anterior skin-lined part of the nasal cavity having vibrissae and can be easily examined by tilting the tip of the nose upwards. It is examined for a furuncle, a fissure, crusting, dislocated caudal end of septum and tumours Option C. Anterior rhinoscopy in which the patient is seated facing the examiner. A thudicum or Vienna type of speculum is used to open the vestibule. The speculum is held in the left hand. It should be fully closed while introducing and partially open when removing from the nose to avoid catching hair.</p>\n<p></p>",

Radical neck dissection is En bloc clearance of fibro-fatty tissue from one side of the neck, including the lymph nodes from levels I - V and lymph node that surround the tail of the parotid gland, with the removal of 3 important structures: The spinal accessory nerve, The internal jugular,  The Sternocleidomastoid muscle. O ption C. In Selective Neck Dissection Don\u2019t remove all five groups of LN; Selectively preserve some groups of LN. Option D. Extended neck dissection consists of any of the neck dissections as described and further extended to include additional lymph node groups or nonlymphatic structures or both. Additional lymph node groups include retropharyngeal, parotid or level VI nodes and nonlymphatic structures may include external carotid artery, hypoglossal nerve, parotid gland and levator scapulae, etc. that are not routinely included in that dissection.</p>\n<p></p>",
