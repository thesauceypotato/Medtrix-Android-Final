The infundibulopelvic ligament attaches the ovary to the lateral pelvic wall and supports the ovary, but has no connection to the vagina or uterus , therefore does not support either structure. So, by exclusion, our answer is the infundibulopelvic ligament THE VAGINA IS SUPPORTED IN THE LOWER PART BY: Bulbocavernosus muscle Urogenital diaphragm Perineal muscles Levator ani muscles(pelvic diaphragm)</p>\n<p></p>",

The peritoneum that folds over the fallopian tube is termed the mesosalpinx, that around the round ligament are the mesoteres, and that over the ovarian ligament is the mesovarium. The Peritoneum that extends beneath the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube toward the pelvic wall forms the suspensory ligament or the infundibulopelvic ligament of the ovary. This contains nerves and ovarian vessels. The broad ligaments are two wing-like structures that extend from the lateral uterine margins to the pelvic sidewalls.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: The round ligament originates somewhat below and anterior to the origin of the fallopian tubes. Each round ligament extends laterally and down into the inguinal canal, through which it passes, to terminate in the upper portion of the ipsilateral labium majus. Sampson artery, a branch of the uterine artery, runs within this ligament. Option B: The cardinal ligament-also called the transverse cervical ligament or Mackenrodt ligament-anchors medially to the uterus and upper vagina . The cardinal ligament is the thick base of the broad ligament. Option C: Uterosacral ligament originates with a posterolateral attachment to the supravaginal portion of the cervix and inserts into the fascia over the sacrum. These ligaments are composed of connective tissue, small bundles of vessels and nerves, and some smooth muscle. Covered by the peritoneum, these ligaments form the lateral boundaries of the pouch of Douglas.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Ovarian vessels travel through the infundibulopelvic ligament The ovarian artery is a direct branch of the abdominal aorta The right ovarian vein drains into the inferior vena cava The left ovarian vein drains into the left renal vein</p>\n<p></p>",
