      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Increasing venous return The question point towards severe anemia in failure. This can be treated by reducing cardiac output, correcting the underlying causes, and IV inotropic agents but not increasing venous return. Reducing venous return (preload) is done by administering diuretics. This reduces heart size. The larger the heart, the more the wall tension and the poorer is the performance. With the reduction in heart size and volume, the myocardial function and the cardiac outcome improve.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. Reducing cardiac work: By correcting anemia, restricting activities, and mechanical ventilation. Option B. Underlying causes such as CHD , coarctation of the aorta, etc, should be diagnosed early and treated curatively or palliatively. Option D. IV inotropes such as dopamine, amrinone, and levosimendan are used in different settings to help in increasing myocardial contractility.</p>\n<p></p>",
