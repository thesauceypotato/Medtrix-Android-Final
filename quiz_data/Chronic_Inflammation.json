The importance of oxygen-dependent bactericidal mechanisms is shown by the existence of a group of congenital disorders called chronic granulomatous disease , which are characterised by defects in bacterial killing and render patients susceptible to recurrent bacterial infection . Chronic granulomatous disease results from inherited defects in the genes encoding components of phagocyte oxidase (PHOX gene) , the phagolysosomal enzyme that generates superoxide (O 2\u2022), causing a defective Respiratory burst . The most common variants are an X-linked defect in one of the membrane-bound components ( gp91phox ) and autosomal recessive defects in the genes encoding two cytoplasmic components ( p47phox and p67phox ).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. It is an autosomal dominant disease. The most common variants are X-linked defects . Option: B. It is characterised by abnormal bacterial phagocytosis. Characterised by defective Respiratory burst . Option: C. Recurrent streptococcal infections are usual in this disease. Increases susceptibility to infections with aureus, some gram-negative bacteria, and fungi .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The name of this disease comes from the macrophage-rich chronic inflammatory reaction that tries to control the infection when the initial neutrophil defence is inadequate. This often leads to c tions of activated macrophages that wall off the microbes, forming granulomas. The Nitroblue tetrazolium test is helpful for screening . Defects in neutrophil function , as in chronic granulomatous disease, increase susceptibility to infections with aureus, some gram-negative bacteria, and fungi .</p>\n<p></p>",

They are called epithelioid cells because they resemble epithelia. A collar of lymphocytes surrounds the aggregates of epithelioid macrophages. Older granulomas may have a rim of fibroblasts and connective tissue . Frequently, but not invariably, multinucleated giant cells 40 to 50 \u00b5m in diameter are found in granulomas called Langhans giant cells . They consist of a large mass of cytoplasm and many nuclei , and they derive from the fusion of multiple activated macrophages. In granulomas associated with certain infectious organisms (most classically Mycobacterium tuberculosis ), a combination of hypoxia and free radical-mediated injury leads to a central zone of necrosis . Grossly , this has a granular, cheesy appearance and is therefore called caseous necrosis . Microscopically , this necrotic material appears as amorphous, structureless, eosinophilic, granular debris with a complete loss of cellular details .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
