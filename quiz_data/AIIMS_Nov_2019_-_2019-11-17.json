Congenital curvatures are due to anomalous development of the vertebrae (failure of formation and/or segmentation). In most cases, congenital scolioses are non-hereditary. It is believed to be related to an insult to the fetus during spine embryological development (between the 5 th -8 th week of gestation). 25% of curves are non-progressive, 25% mildly progressive and 50% highly progressive and will require treatment. The mainstay of treatment is either observation or surgery. The rigidity of the curve is assessed, and the rib hump measured. Associated malformations must be looked for clinically: look for foot or leg asymmetry, craniofacial malformation, a Klippel-Feil web neck, and cardiac and urinary malformations. Full-body-width Postero-anterior (PA) and lateral X-rays are essential. After 1 year of age, X-rays should be taken standing, with the legs in extension and the pelvis level, to compensate for any leg length discrepancy. The Cobb angle will be measured. CT scans shows a bony bar. Congenital scoliosis can be classified into defect of formation or defect of segmentation: Fully segmented hemivertebra (two growth plates) with a contralateral bar Unilateral unsegmented bar Two consecutives fully segmented hemivertebrae Fully segmented hemivertebra Semi segmented hemivertebra Wedge vertebra (partial failure of formation) Incarcerated hemivertebra (smaller and induce little deformity as the hemivertebra sits in a non-growing block; the alignment of the pedicles usually remains straight)</li><li>\u2022 Congenital scoliosis is the most frequent congenital deformity of the spine.</li><li>\u2022 Congenital curvatures are due to anomalous development of the vertebrae (failure of formation and/or segmentation).</li><li>\u2022 In most cases, congenital scolioses are non-hereditary.</li><li>\u2022 It is believed to be related to an insult to the fetus during spine embryological development (between the 5 th -8 th week of gestation).</li><li>\u2022 25% of curves are non-progressive, 25% mildly progressive and 50% highly progressive and will require treatment.</li><li>\u2022 The mainstay of treatment is either observation or surgery.</li><li>\u2022 The rigidity of the curve is assessed, and the rib hump measured.</li><li>\u2022 Associated malformations must be looked for clinically: look for foot or leg asymmetry, craniofacial malformation, a Klippel-Feil web neck, and cardiac and urinary malformations.</li><li>\u2022 Full-body-width Postero-anterior (PA) and lateral X-rays are essential.</li><li>\u2022 After 1 year of age, X-rays should be taken standing, with the legs in extension and the pelvis level, to compensate for any leg length discrepancy.</li><li>\u2022 The Cobb angle will be measured.</li><li>\u2022 CT scans shows a bony bar.</li><li>\u2022 Congenital scoliosis can be classified into defect of formation or defect of segmentation: Fully segmented hemivertebra (two growth plates) with a contralateral bar Unilateral unsegmented bar Two consecutives fully segmented hemivertebrae Fully segmented hemivertebra Semi segmented hemivertebra Wedge vertebra (partial failure of formation) Incarcerated hemivertebra (smaller and induce little deformity as the hemivertebra sits in a non-growing block; the alignment of the pedicles usually remains straight)</li><li>\u2022 Fully segmented hemivertebra (two growth plates) with a contralateral bar Unilateral unsegmented bar Two consecutives fully segmented hemivertebrae Fully segmented hemivertebra Semi segmented hemivertebra Wedge vertebra (partial failure of formation) Incarcerated hemivertebra (smaller and induce little deformity as the hemivertebra sits in a non-growing block; the alignment of the pedicles usually remains straight)</li><li>\u2022 Fully segmented hemivertebra (two growth plates) with a contralateral bar</li><li>\u2022 Unilateral unsegmented bar</li><li>\u2022 Two consecutives fully segmented hemivertebrae</li><li>\u2022 Fully segmented hemivertebra</li><li>\u2022 Semi segmented hemivertebra</li><li>\u2022 Wedge vertebra (partial failure of formation)</li><li>\u2022 Incarcerated hemivertebra (smaller and induce little deformity as the hemivertebra sits in a non-growing block; the alignment of the pedicles usually remains straight)</li><li>\u2022 Treatment: Treatment consists of either observation of the curve or surgery, or, rarely, bracing. Observation should be applied only for non-progressive curves with a balanced spine. Bracing is inefficient in congenital scoliosis. It may be indicated for long flexible curves or to control the compensatory lumbar curve or help rebalancing the spine, or it may be used after an operation, for instance, until the fusion is solid. Surgery is the mainstay of care. Prophylactic surgery: surgery that will prevent further worsening or allow progressive correction over time. These operations are in situ fusion and hemi epiphysiodesis. In situ fusion can be done with a single posterior fusion, with or without instrumentation or with an anterior fusion, or a 360\u00b0 fusion.</li><li>\u2022 Treatment: Treatment consists of either observation of the curve or surgery, or, rarely, bracing.

There is a genetic component, but the etiology is multifactorial. It is grouped by age. In children age 3 and younger, it is called infantile scoliosis. In age 4-10, it is called juvenile scoliosis. In age >10, it is called adolescent scoliosis. Structural curve becomes more prominent on forward bending (Adams test) as opposed to postural scoliosis. Compensatory curve due to limb length discrepancy or sciatic list (due to disc prolapsed) disappear on sitting.  Postural scoliosis disappears on forward bending.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Pudendal nerve</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The structure marked in green is the ischial spine and the pudendal nerve is related to it.</li><li>\u2022 The ischial spine is a bony projection from the posterior part of the ischium in the pelvis</li><li>\u2022 The pudendal nerve originates from the sacral plexus S2-S4. It exits out of the pelvis by passing through the greater sciatic foramen. It then enters the perineum below the pelvic floor by passing around the ischial spine. The ischial spine is used as a landmark for pudendal nerve block.</li><li>\u2022 Sensory function: The pudendal nerve provides sensation to the external genitalia, perineum, and anus. Motor function: The pudendal nerve also supplies motor function to the pelvic floor muscles, including the external anal sphincter, bulbospongiosus muscle, and ischiocavernosus muscle. Sexual function: The pudendal nerve plays a crucial role in sexual function by supplying motor and sensory innervation to the genital organs. Urinary and fecal continence: The pudendal nerve is involved in maintaining urinary and fecal continence by controlling the external anal sphincter muscle. Damage to the pudendal nerve can lead to incontinence, which is the loss of control over urinary or fecal elimination.Top of Form</li><li>\u2022 Sensory function: The pudendal nerve provides sensation to the external genitalia, perineum, and anus.</li><li>\u2022 Motor function: The pudendal nerve also supplies motor function to the pelvic floor muscles, including the external anal sphincter, bulbospongiosus muscle, and ischiocavernosus muscle.</li><li>\u2022 Sexual function: The pudendal nerve plays a crucial role in sexual function by supplying motor and sensory innervation to the genital organs.</li><li>\u2022 Urinary and fecal continence: The pudendal nerve is involved in maintaining urinary and fecal continence by controlling the external anal sphincter muscle.

Sciatic nerve: The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body and originates from the sacral plexus (L4-S3). It exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen, below the piriformis muscle. While it is near the ischial spine, it descends posteriorly down the thigh, dividing into the tibial and common fibular (peroneal) nerves. It provides motor and sensory innervation to the posterior thigh and most of the leg and foot. Its relation to the ischial spine is less clinically significant than the pudendal nerve's.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Sciatic nerve:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Obturator nerve: The obturator nerve arises from the lumbar plexus (L2-L4). It exits the pelvis through the obturator foramen and provides sensory and motor innervation to the medial thigh. In terms of its relationship to the ischial spine, it is anatomically distinct, as it courses more anteriorly in the pelvis, and it doesn't have significant clinical associations with the ischial spine.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Obturator nerve:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Femoral nerve: The femoral nerve also originates from the lumbar plexus (L2-L4). It descends through the psoas muscle and enters the thigh beneath the inguinal ligament. It provides motor innervation to the anterior thigh muscles and sensory innervation to the anterior thigh and medial leg. The femoral nerve's course is anterior in the pelvis, and it doesn't have a direct relationship or significant clinical association with the ischial spine.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Femoral nerve:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The pudendal nerve arises from the sacral plexus (S2-S4 nerve roots). It exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen, just inferior to the piriformis muscle. It then courses around the ischial spine and re-enters the pelvis through the lesser sciatic foramen. The pudendal nerve provides sensory and motor innervation to the perineal region and external genitalia. Due to its proximity to the ischial spine, the pudendal nerve can be blocked for pain relief during childbirth and certain surgical procedures in the perineal region.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. B. Add 0.5 ml Heparin to the syringe before taking blood</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Add 0.5 ml Heparin to the syringe before taking blood: Traditionally, to prevent blood from clotting inside the syringe when obtaining an ABG, a small amount of heparin was added to the syringe. However, in contemporary practice, syringes used for ABG are pre-heparinized, which means they already contain a coating of dry heparin that will mix with the blood sample and prevent clotting. Adding additional heparin to such a syringe is unnecessary and can dilute the sample, potentially altering the results.</li><li>\u2022 Add 0.5 ml Heparin to the syringe before taking blood:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Normal pH can't rule out acid base disorder: This statement is accurate. A patient can have a mixed acid-base disorder where two primary disorders (e.g., metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis) coexist and \"cancel\" each other out, leading to a seemingly \"normal\" pH. However, when the components of the arterial blood gas (ABG) like PaCO2 and HCO3- are evaluated, abnormalities can be detected.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Normal pH can't rule out acid base disorder:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. If modified Allen\u2019s test is negative, alternate site is chosen: The modified Allen's test is a simple way to evaluate the collateral blood flow to the hand via the ulnar artery. Before taking a sample or placing an arterial line in the radial artery, it's a recommended step to ensure that if the radial artery becomes occluded, the hand will still receive adequate blood flow. If the test is negative (indicative of inadequate collateral flow), it's safer to choose an alternate site for arterial puncture.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. If modified Allen\u2019s test is negative, alternate site is chosen:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Radial artery is the preferred site: The radial artery is commonly chosen for ABG sampling and arterial line placement due to its accessibility, the presence of collateral blood flow (via the ulnar artery), and its relatively superficial location which makes puncture technically easier. Furthermore, complications like hematoma or injury are less problematic at this location when compared to other potential sites, such as the femoral artery.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Deep Incisional SSI: Infection also occurs within 30 days after the operation but involves deeper tissues, such as muscles and fascia, at the incision site. Organ/Space SSI: Infection can occur within 30 or 90 days after the operation and affects any part of the body other than the incision area. This can include infections within the abdominal or chest cavities. Signs and Symptoms: The symptoms of an SSI may include redness, warmth, swelling, pain, and discharge at or near the surgical site. Systemic symptoms like fever, chills, and malaise can also occur if the infection is severe or has spread. Prevention: Preventive measures are crucial in reducing the risk of SSIs. These measures include: Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis Proper hand hygiene and sterile techniques during surgery Maintaining a clean surgical environment Adequate skin preparation before incision Proper wound care and postoperative monitoring Treatment: Treatment of an SSI typically involves antibiotics to target the specific bacteria causing the infection. In some cases, additional interventions may be necessary, such as wound drainage, debridement (removal of infected tissue), or, rarely, reoperation. Complications: If left untreated or not managed appropriately, SSIs can lead to more serious complications, such as abscess formation, cellulitis, tissue necrosis, and the spread of infection to other parts of the body.</li><li>\u27a4 Classification: SSIs are classified into three main categories based on the timing of onset: Superficial Incisional SSI: Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation and involves only the skin and subcutaneous tissues at the incision site.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. C) Shin splint</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Lisfranc fracture. A Lisfranc dislocation is a spectrum of injuries involving the tarsometatarsal joints of the foot. The Lisfranc joint is composed of the articulation between the first, second, and third metatarsals bones, and the cuneiform bones. Injury of the joint can range from complete tarsometatarsal displacement with associated fractures and ligamentous tears to partial sprains with no displacement. Lisfranc injuries are uncommon and are often misdiagnosed. Even when recognized and treated promptly, there is still a high risk for chronic disability and complications. There are two main mechanisms of injury: direct, and indirect. A direct mechanism occurs as a crush injury to the joint from motor vehicle collision or industrial accident. An indirect injury is more common and is often associated with sports participation involving a longitudinal force with the foot in plantarflexion with a medial or lateral rotational force. The patient presents with complaint of midfoot pain with weight-bearing, following an acute injury. The pain worsens by forefoot weight bearing, and the patient may describe pain or difficulty with the push-off phases of walking and/or running. There is pain with abduction and eversion of the forefoot. Pain can also commonly be reproduced with passive pronation or supination of the tarsometatarsal joint. Radiographic findings show misalignment of the lateral margin of the first metatarsal base with the lateral edge of the medial cuneiform, misalignment of the medial aspect of the second metatarsal base with the medial edge of the middle cuneiform, and/or small avulsion fragments a one of metatarsal or cuneiform bones. On oblique view, the medial aspect of the cuboid should line up with the medial aspect of the fourth metatarsal base. The dorsal cortex of the first metatarsal and medial cuneiform should be aligned on the lateral radiographs. Lisfranc injuries can be managed operatively. Initial treatment includes reduction, splinting, and elevation. After six weeks, if the patient is non-tender and radiographs are negative, then begin weight-bearing and rehabilitation. If there is any tenderness but no displacement, then the patient should be in a boot or cast for at least another four weeks before starting rehabilitation. Any displacement requires surgical fixation.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Lisfranc fracture.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Jones fracture. A Jones fracture is a fracture of the proximal metadiaphyseal junction of the fifth metatarsal bone that involves the 4 th -5 th metatarsal articulation. The fracture occurs as a result of significant adduction force to the forefoot with the ankle in plantar flexion. On a plain radiograph, Jones fracture is located at the metadiaphyseal junction, approximately 2 cm (1.5-3 cm) from the tip of the 5 th metatarsal and has a predominantly horizontal course. It should not extend distally. Jones fractures are particularly prone to non-union due to being in a vascular watershed zone and take longer than two months to heal. Displacement of the fracture can increase with persistent weight-bearing; therefore, immobilization is important, with a non-weight bearing cast for 6-8 weeks. Indications for non-operative management include undisplaced fractures and fractures in patients with limited activity (i.e. recreational athletes). Operative management is indicated in patients that are elite or competitive athletes or when delayed union has occurred. Management includes either intramedullary screw fixation or open reduction and internal fixation.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Jones fracture.</li><li>\u2022 Jones fracture</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Nutcracker fracture. A nutcracker fracture refers to a cuboid bone fracture with associated navicular avulsion fracture due to compression between the bases of 4 th and 5 th metatarsals and calcaneus bone. The injury usually occurs secondary to the traumatic abduction of the forefoot. This results in loss of the normal lateral column support and excess valgus force upon the medial column that commonly causes rupture of tibialis posterior tendon or avulsion fracture of its attachment onto medial aspect of the tarsal navicular bone. Nutcracker fractures are clinically significant because they can interfere with the medchanical alignment of the foot.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

The seashore sign is characterized by a sandy or granular pattern in the lower half of the M-mode display, beneath the pleural line. This pattern is caused by the motion of the lung relative to the pleura during breathing. It is a normal finding, indicating that the lung is sliding smoothly against the parietal pleura, which helps rule out conditions like pneumothorax in the area scanned.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Fractures between the proximal third of the ulna and the base of olecranon combined with dislocation of the proximal radioulnar joint. The clue to successful treatment is to restore the length of the fractured ulna; only then can the dislocated joint be fully reduced and remain stable. In adults, treatment is reduction and fixation. In children, treatment is reduction and cast application. Posterior interosseous nerve has been most commonly injured nerve in association with Monteggia fracture dislocation because it takes a turn around radial head and is injured with its dislocation. This causes paralysis of thumb and finger extensors.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

It is also involved in the differentiation of immune cells, such as the development of memory T cells. Interleukin-4 (IL-4): Plays a key role in the development of Th2 cells, which are involved in the immune response to parasites and allergies. IL-4 also stimulates the production of antibodies by B cells. Interleukin-5 (IL-5): S pecifically activates basophils, contributing to their role in allergic responses and inflammation. Interleukin-6 (IL-6): Plays a key role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses. It can stimulate the production of acute-phase proteins, such as C-reactive protein, as well as the activation of immune cells like plasma cells. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) : Plays a key role in regulating the immune response and limiting inflammation. It can suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the activation of immune cells. Interleukin-12 (IL-12 ): IL-12 is involved in the activation of T cells and NK cells.

BMI > 30:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Upper abdominal surgery: Upper abdominal surgeries are associated with a higher risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. The diaphragmatic movement can be impaired after these surgeries, leading to decreased lung expansion and atelectasis, especially in the bases of the lungs. This can increase the chances of postoperative pneumonia and other respiratory issues.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Upper abdominal surgery:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Age > 70 years: Advanced age is a recognized risk factor for postoperative complications, including pulmonary complications. Older patients often have reduced physiological reserve, which means they have less ability to compensate for postoperative stress and changes in lung function.
