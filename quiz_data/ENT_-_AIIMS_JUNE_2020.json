      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Tracheoesophageal prosthesis Above image is of tracheoesophageal prosthesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Tracheoesophageal voice prosthesis (TEP) A device that is placed in the wall that separates the trachea and esophagus in order to enable a total laryngectomy patient to make voice. The tracheoesophageal voice prosthesis (TEP) uses a one-way valve to let air pushed up from the lungs to pass through from the trachea and enter the esophagus, causing the walls of the esophagus to vibrate as a new voice, but without letting food or liquids to pass through the other way, from the esophagus to the trachea. A patient who undergoes a total laryngectomy procedure will have the entire larynx removed and the end of the trachea redirected to an opening\u2014called a stoma\u2014created in the front of the neck. The result is that the patient can now breathe through this stoma, but would be unable to make any voice, because the larynx (voice box) is gone, and the air for voicing that once passed up through the larynx, causing the vocal cords to vibrate and thereby making voice, now simply exits the trachea at the stoma. Such a patient can obtain an alternate voice by using a TEP device.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION B- An electronic larynx (Electrolarynx), is a battery operated machine that produces sound for you to create a voice. There are many different makes and types, but they are usually about the size of a small electric razor. OPTION C- Esophageal speech technique uses the body\u2019s natural tissues as the new voice source and requires you to swallow small amounts of air into your esophagus before forcing them back up. The column of swallowed air causes the food pipe to vibrate, generating the sound that is further modified by the tongue and lips to create words. OPTION D- There is nothing as such like chicago prosthesis</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dix Hallpike Dix Hallpike manoeuvre is the diagnostic test for BPPV.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>A number of different manoeuvre can be used to test for BPPV depending upon the canal that is affected. The Dix\u2013Hallpike test is used to diagnose posterior canal BPPV, which is the most common manifestation. The patient\u2019s head is turned 45\u00b0 horizontally whilst he is in a sitting position. The patient then quickly lies down with the head hanging over the edge of the bed by approximately 30\u00b0. This brings the posterior canal of the down- side ear into the vertical plane, allowing gravity to act fully. The patient is required to keep his eyes open throughout this procedure, and the examiner checks for nystagmus. The most commonly observed eye movement is an upbeating torsional geotropic nystagmus, which results from excitation of the posterior semicircular canal (PSC). It is to be noted that the anterior canal of the downside ear is also in a more dependent position and therefore can be triggered. In this case a down beating torsional nystagmus is observed. It is important to wait at least 30 seconds before sitting the patient up as the onset of nystagmus can be delayed in canalithiasis. The differentiation between canalithiasis and cupulolithiasis is based on the latency and duration as discussed previously. Once the patient is ready, the test is then repeated on the other side.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A- Brandt Daroff exercise helps in treatment of certain types of vertigo. OPTION B- Epley\u2019s maneuvre is used in treatment of BPPV. OPTION D- There is nothing as such like Hassel backs test for management of BPPV.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>BPPV Treatment involves moving the otoconial debris into the utricle where it is believed to be reabsorbed. Manoeuvres to address posterior canal BPPV include the Epley, Semont and Brandt-Daroff exercises. Each has its merits, with the Semont and Brandt-Daroff particle positioning manoeuvres performed by patients at home. The Epley manoeuvre is immediately curative in more than 85 percent of patients, but recurrence is common within the first year. A barbeque roll may be used to treat lateral canal BPPV.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Agger nasi The largest of the anterior ethmoid air cells is the ethmoid bulla.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>This is the most consistent surgical landmark. It may be unpneumatized in 8 per cent of patients. The ground lamella constitutes the posterior boundary of the bulla ethmoidalis. Suprabullar and retrobullar recesses may be formed when the ethmoid bulla does not extend to the skull base. The suprabullar recess is formed when there is a cleft between the roof of the ethmoid bulla and the fovea. The retrobullar space is formed when there is a cleft between the basal lamella and the bulla. These spaces are collectively called the lateral sinus. The ostia of the anterior ethmoid cells open into the ethmoid infundibulum in the middle meatus. The most anterior ethmoid air cell is called the agger nasi cell.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION B- Ethmoidal bulla : This is the largest ethmoidal air cell and drains usually into the hiatus semilunaris in the middle meatus. The ethmoidal bulla can sometimes be made up of a group of cells that may communicate with each other. OPTION D- Concha bullosa: Aeration of the middle turbinate can cause narrowing of the nasal cavity and also the infundibulum OPTION C- Fovea ethmoidalis: A low-lying fovea ethmoidalis and cribriform plate have an increased risk of penetration during surgery.</p>\n<p></p>",
