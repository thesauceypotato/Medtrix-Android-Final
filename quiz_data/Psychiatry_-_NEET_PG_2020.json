      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Stop the current antidepressant and start Mood stabilizers The patient's symptoms of excessive talk and increased activity suggest a possible manic episode. This could be a result of Imipramine, as it can induce manic or hypomanic symptoms in individuals with underlying bipolar disorder. Therefore, the appropriate course of action would be to discontinue the antidepressant and initiate mood stabilizers to address the manic symptoms and stabilize the patient's mood.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) commonly used for the treatment of depression. TCAs can induce manic or hypomanic symptoms in individuals with underlying bipolar disorder. Mood stabilizers, such as lithium or certain anticonvulsants, are the preferred choice for managing bipolar disorder and stabilizing mood during manic episodes.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Stop the current antidepressant and start antipsychotics: While antipsychotics can be used to manage acute manic symptoms, initiating them as the first-line treatment without mood stabilizers may not adequately address the underlying bipolar disorder. Option C. Continue the current antidepressant and add Mood stabilizer: Continuing the antidepressant without discontinuing it can potentially exacerbate manic symptoms. Adding a mood stabilizer is important for managing the underlying bipolar disorder. Option D. Continue the current antidepressant and add antipsychotics: Adding antipsychotics alone without discontinuing the antidepressant may not be sufficient to address the manic symptoms and stabilize the patient's mood.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Careful evaluation of a patient's psychiatric history and symptoms is crucial before prescribing antidepressants, especially in individuals with a known or suspected bipolar disorder. Rapid cycling bipolar disorder, characterized by frequent and short episodes of mania and depression, is associated with a higher risk of antidepressant-induced mania. Collaborative decision-making involving the patient, their family, and the healthcare provider is important in choosing the appropriate treatment strategy for bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Serum lithium Serum lithium levels should be checked in this patient presenting with seizures, coarse tremors, confusion, and weakness of limbs after fasting for a day. This presentation suggests lithium toxicity, which can occur due to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances caused by fasting. Monitoring serum lithium levels is crucial to assess the drug's concentration in the body and ensure it remains within the therapeutic range to prevent toxicity.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Lithium is commonly used in the treatment of bipolar affective disorder. Lithium toxicity can occur due to factors such as dehydration, changes in kidney function, and drug interactions. Symptoms of lithium toxicity include tremors, confusion, seizures, weakness, and altered mental status.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. EEG: Although an EEG may be helpful in assessing seizure activity, it is not the primary investigation to diagnose lithium toxicity. Option B. Neuro-imaging: Neuro-imaging is not the initial investigation for lithium toxicity. The clinical presentation and serum lithium levels are more indicative of the diagnosis. Option C. Serum electrolytes: While assessing serum electrolytes is important in the evaluation of patients, specifically to rule out any abnormalities that may contribute to seizures, it is not the most appropriate investigation to diagnose lithium toxicity.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Lithium serum level A safe blood level of lithium is 0.6 and 1.2 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L).

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Panic attack A panic attack is characterized by the sudden onset of intense fear or discomfort, accompanied by various physical symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, shortness of breath, and a sense of impending doom. The individual often avoids situations or places associated with the panic attacks, as seen in this case where the patient avoids going to college and insists on having someone accompany her. The symptoms described by the patient are consistent with a panic attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Panic attacks are often associated with a sudden surge of sympathetic activity, leading to various physical symptoms. Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent panic attacks and is often associated with anticipatory anxiety and fear of future attacks. Panic attacks can be triggered by specific situations or can occur unexpectedly without any identifiable trigger.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Phobia: Phobia refers to an excessive and irrational fear of a specific object, situation, or activity. While phobias can cause anxiety, the symptoms described by the patient, including intense perspiration, palpitation, and difficulty in breathing, are more suggestive of a panic attack rather than a specific phobia. Option C. Generalized anxiety disorder: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) involves excessive worry and anxiety about various events or activities. Although the patient experiences anxiety and avoids going to college, the key feature of GAD is persistent and excessive worry, rather than the acute and intense symptoms seen in panic attacks. Option D. Conversion disorder: Conversion disorder involves the presence of neurological symptoms (e.g., paralysis, blindness) that cannot be explained by any underlying organic pathology. The patient's symptoms, such as feeling of impending doom, intense perspiration, palpitation, and difficulty in breathing, are more characteristic of a panic attack rather than conversion disorder.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Panic disorder is commonly associated with agoraphobia, which involves fear and avoidance of situations where escape might be difficult or help may not be available. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for panic disorder, focusing on identifying and challenging irrational thoughts and gradually exposing the individual to feared situations.</p>\n<p></p>",

Trihexyphenidyl is a commonly used anticholinergic agent that can effectively manage the extrapyramidal symptoms associated with antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism. It acts by blocking the muscarinic receptors, thereby reducing the excessive cholinergic activity implicated in these symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>In severe cases of EPS, if the symptoms are not adequately controlled with anticholinergic agents, reduction in the dose of the offending antipsychotic or switching to a different antipsychotic with lower extrapyramidal side effects may be considered.
