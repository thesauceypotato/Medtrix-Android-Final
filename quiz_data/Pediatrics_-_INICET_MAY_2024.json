Clinical Presentation Precocious puberty (sexual maturity rating of 5 in a 10-year-old boy) Accelerated growth (height age greater than chronological age) Hyperpigmentation Short stature Hypertension (BP 180/110 mmHg) Pathophysiology In 11-beta hydroxylase deficiency, the lack of 11-beta hydroxylase enzyme leads to the accumulation of 11-deoxycortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone. These precursors are shunted towards the androgen biosynthetic pathway, resulting in excess production of androgens, which causes the clinical manifestations of precocious puberty, accelerated growth, and hyperpigmentation. The accumulation of 11-deoxycorticosterone can also lead to hypertension .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. 21 Alpha Hydroxylase Deficiency causes adrenal insufficiency and excess androgens; leads to virilization and precocious puberty but typically does not cause hypertension. Option: C. 3 Beta Dehydrogenase Deficiency results in a lack of all steroid hormones, leading to adrenal crisis and ambiguous genitalia. Would not cause precocious puberty or hypertension. Option: D. Cholesterol Side Chain Cleavage Enzyme Deficiency Features : Blocks all steroid hormone production, causing severe adrenal insufficiency and hypotension. Would lead to hypotension, not hypertension.</p>\n<p></p>",

D: Correctly indicates when a CT scan might be considered for a child with a febrile seizure.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Febrile Seizures Febrile seizures are convulsions associated with an elevated temperature greater than 38 degrees Celsius in children 6 months to 5 years of age. They occur in 2 to 4 % of children younger than 5 years old and are slightly more common in males. We subdivide febrile seizures into simplex and complex febrile seizures. Simple Febrile Seizures are considered simple if they are generalized seizures that last less than 15 minutes and do not recur within a 24-hour period. Complex Febrile Seizure are considered complex, if any of the following occur: they are focal seizures, last longer than 15 minutes, or occur more than once in a 24-hour period. Causes: Febrile seizures are more commonly due to viral infections than bacterial (HHV-6 being the most commonly associated viral illness), they tend to occur early in the illness, and no explicit work-up is mandated but rather testing is patient-specific.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Multicystic encephalomalacia Severe brain injury leading to spastic quadriplegia, multicystic encephalomalacia can indeed be a significant MRI finding.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Multicystic encephalomalacia is a sequela of diffuse hypoxic-ischaemic insult of the brain It is commonly characterised by atrophic expansion of the ventricles with intact ventricular walls, multiple cysts of different sizes involving the cerebral white matter, the cerebellar hemispheres, and the spinal cord is usually spared apart from Wallerian degeneration of the corticospinal tracts.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Basal Ganglia Calcifications: Often associated with congenital infections or metabolic disorders, but not typically a direct cause of spastic quadriplegia. Option: B. Periventricular Leukomalacia (PVL): While PVL is common in preterm infants and can lead to spastic diplegia, it is not the primary finding in cases of severe brain injury leading to spastic quadriplegia. Option: C. Cerebellar Degeneration: More associated with ataxic cerebral palsy rather than spastic quadriplegia.</p>\n<p></p>",
