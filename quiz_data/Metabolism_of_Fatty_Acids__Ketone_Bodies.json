      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hypoglycemia, acidosis, and elevated urine dicarboxylic acids Disorders of fatty acid oxidation becomes worse in fasting to cause carnitine depletion, failure of fatty acid oxidation, and accumulation of dicarboxylic acid. Deficiencies in medium-chain fatty acid oxidation are milder and may present after an illness with calorie deprivation in children aged 2 to 6 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option: B. Galactosemia symptoms appear on exposure to lactose-containing formula, producing hypoglycemia, liver failure, and excretion of urinary sugars Option: C. Amino acids metabolic disorders such as Tyrosinemia and maple syrup urine disease worsen after protein feeding and produce elevated levels of tyrosine or branch-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine). Option: Urea cycle disorders worsen during fasting (catabolic breakdown) on protein feeding, with excess ammonia production, rapid breathing, and respiratory alkalosis.</p>\n<p></p>",
