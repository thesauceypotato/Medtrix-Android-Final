Displacement (psychiatry) is an immature defense mechanism in which an individual redirects impulses and emotions from a target that is perceived as threatening or unacceptable to another that is perceived as less threatening or more acceptable . Though this woman directs her frustrations about her ex-husband's timidity to the therapist, she has confronted her ex-husband in the past and is less likely to perceive him as a threatening or unacceptable target. Option: C. Passive aggression is an immature defense mechanism in which an individual demonstrates negative feelings in an indirect, non-confrontational manner. If this woman did not confront her ex-husband about his timidity and instead expressed her discontent through passive behaviors such as deliberate failure to contribute to shared responsibilities, she would exhibit this defense mechanism. Option: D. Projection is an immature defense mechanism in which an individual projects an unacceptable internal impulse onto an external source . If this woman were frustrated at her therapist and accused the therapist of being frustrated at her, she would exhibit this defense mechanism.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>2,3,4 Dreams are the economic expression of latent unconscious contents. The process of dream formation involves Symbolism Displacement Condensation Projection Secondary revision Symbolism : It is a complex process of indirect representation or substitution of the idea with a symbol that derives its secondary significance from the idea. A symbol is sensory and concrete in nature while the idea is relatively abstract and complex . Example: seeing anger as fire. Displacement : It is the mechanism of transfer of amounts of energy (cathexis) from the original object to a substitute which is relatively neutral and less invested with affective Energy. Example: In a dream, the mother may be represented visually by an unknown female figure (who has less emotional significance for the dreamer) Condensation : It is the mechanism by which several unconscious wishes , impulses, or attitudes can be combined into a single image in the manifest dream content. Example: In a child\u2019s nightmare, an attacking monster may come to represent not only the dreamer\u2019s father but may also represent some aspects of the mother and even, in addition, some of the child\u2019s own primitive hostile impulses as well. Projection : This process allows dreamers to rid themselves of their own unacceptable wishes or impulses and experience them as emanating in the dream from other persons or independent sources. Example: The individual who has a strong repressed wish to be unfaithful to his wife may dream that his wife has been unfaithful to him. Secondary Revision : It is the final process that reorganizes the absurd, illogical, and bizarre aspects of the dream into a more logical and coherent form, particularly in the context of recounting the dream in a coherent narrative to someone else. Suppression is a defense mechanism and is not involved in the dream process . It is the conscious or semiconscious decision to postpone attention to a conscious impulse or conflict .</p>\n<p></p>",
