It constitutes approximately 10% of all cases of herpes zoster. Herpes zoster occurs more commonly in immunocompromised individuals. Aetiology Varicella-zoster virus. It is a DNA virus and produces acidophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies. It is neurotropic in nature. Pathogenesis . The infection is contracted in childhood, which manifests chickenpox, and the child develops immunity. The virus then remains dormant in the sensory ganglion of the trigeminal nerve. lt is thought that, usually in elderly people, though (can occur at any age) with depressed cellular immunity, the virus reactivates, replicates, and travels down along one or more of the branches of the ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve to produce cutaneous and ocular lesions. The people, particularly prone to herpes zoster ophthalmicus, are the elderly with depressed cellular immunity, for example, those suffering from, disseminated TB, cancer, leukemia, AIDS or immunocompromised organs.

The patient is an adult A history of malaria or any stress stimuli activates the virus.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Recurrent Ocular Herpes The virus, which lies dormant in the trigeminal ganglion , periodically reactivates and replicates. The reactivated virus in enveloped infectious form travels down along the trigeminal nerve to cause recurrent infection. The recurrent herpetic ocular infection is not associated with systemic features and typically is a unilateral disease. Predisposing stress stimuli that trigger an attack of herpetic keratitis include fevers such as malaria, flu, exposure to ultraviolet rays, general ill health, emotional or physical exhaustion, mild trauma, menstrual stress following administration of topical or systemic steroids, and immunosuppressive agents. Epithelial keratitis Symptoms: of epithelial HSV keratitis include redness, pain, photophobia, tearing and decreased vision. Sign: Three distinct patterns of epithelial keratitis seen are: punctate epithelial keratitis (fine or coarse superficial punctate lesions) , dendritic ulcer: Dendritic ulcer is a typical and most common lesion of recurrent epithelial keratitis. The ulcer is of an irregular, zigzag Linear branching shape. The branches are generally knobbed at the ends, and geographical ulcer ( sometimes, the branches of dendritic ulcer enlarge and coalesce to form a large epithelial ulcer with a 'geographic' or 'amoeboid' configuration, hence the name). Stromal keratitis Disciform keratitis pathogenesis . It occurs due to a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the HSV antigen. Primarily, endotheliitis occurs. Endothelial damage results in disciform corneal stromal oedema due to an imbibition of aqueous humour. Symptoms include photophobia, mild-to-moderate ocular discomfort, and a reduction in visual acuity. Disciform keratitis is characterized by: Focal disc-shaped patch of stromal oedema without necrosis, usually with an intact epithelium. Folds in Descemet's membrane, arc after percent. Keratic precipitates a.re seen under the round area of stromal edema. Ring of stromal infiltrate (Wessley immune ring) may be present surrounding the stromal oedema. It signifies the junction between viral antigen and host antibody. Corneal sensations are diminished. Intraocular pressure (IOP) may be raised despite only mild anterior uveitis due to trabeculitis. In severe cases, anterior uveitis may be marked.

Prospective studies also show that common childhood infections, including diarrhea, respiratory illness, measles, and chickenpox, induce hypovitaminosis A. During acute infection, not only is the food intake reduced but metabolic alterations are also known to occur. These include decreased absorption of vitamin A, impaired retinol transport, and increased renal excretion. Slow normalization of these mechanisms coupled with low dietary intake of vitamin A during the acute phase and recovery lead to VAD.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Herpes Simplex Keratitis Patients with HSV keratitis may complain of the following: Pain Photophobia Blurred vision Tearing Redness The earliest sign of active viral replication in the corneal epithelium is the development of small, raised, clear vesicles. Dendritic ulcers are the most common presentation of HSV keratitis. Prominent features of a dendritic ulcer include a linear branching pattern with terminal bulbs at the ends of the branches, swollen epithelial borders of the branches, and central ulceration through the basement membrane. The earliest signs of neurotrophic keratopathy include an irregular corneal surface and punctate epithelial erosions. These erosions may progress to a persistent epithelial defect and eventual stromal ulceration. Necrotizing stromal keratitis is characterized by dense stromal infiltrate, ulceration, and necrosis. Immune stromal keratitis (ISK) may present clinically with focal, multifocal, or diffuse cellular infiltrates; immune rings; neovascularization; or ghost vessels at any level of the cornea.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B .
