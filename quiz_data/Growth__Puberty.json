Initially, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone GnRH pulses occur only during nights followed by secretion during both day and night. Due to pulsatile nature of its secretions, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone GnRH stimulation test is better marker of evaluation of pubertal disorders compared to baseline GnRH evaluation. This pulsatile Gonadotropin-releasing hormone GnRH secretion stimulates secretion of both Luteinizing hormone LH and Follicle stimulating hormone FSH . Both FSH and LH will further stimulate the secretion of estrogen and testosterone levels. While androgens and its secretions can be good markers to support/confirm pubertal status, they are possibly less valuable markers for initial evaluation.</p>\n<p></p>",
