      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Unbound T4 Iatrogenic hypothyroidism is a common cause of hypothyroidism and can often be detected by screening before symptoms develop eg following radioiodine treatment. Because TSH levels are suppressed by hyperthyroidism, unbound T4 levels are a better measure of thyroid function than TSH in the months following radioiodine treatment. Low-dose thyroxine treatment can be withdrawn if recovery occurs.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A: TSH levels are suppressed by hyperthyroidism so NOT a good parameter.

Prader-Willi syndrome is associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hyperphagia-obesity, chronic muscle hypotonia, mental retardation, and adult-onset diabetes mellitus . Multiple somatic defects also involve the skull, eyes, ears, hands, and feet</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options A: Numerous subtypes of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) have been identified, with genetic linkage to at least nine different loci. Several of the loci encode genes involved in basal body cilia function, and this may account for the diverse clinical manifestations. Options C: Kallmann syndrome results from defective hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) synthesis and is associated with anosmia or hyposmia due to olfactory bulb agenesis or hypoplasia. The initial genetic cause was identified in the X-linked KAL gene. Option: D: Septo-optic dysplasia-affected children have mutations in the HESX1 gene , which is involved in the early development of the ventral prosencephalon.</p>\n<p></p>",

The delay in the development of milestones and the development of dry skin and the episodes of dyspnea point towards the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism In this hypothyroidism, the treatment must be started early because of the severe neurological consequence of untreated congenital hypothyroidism Early treatment with t4 results in normal IQ levels , but subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities may occur in those with the most severe hypothyroidism at diagnosis or when treatment is delayed or suboptimal. Many screening programs have been established Even with treatment, neuro developmental abnormalities may occur in those with the most severe hypothyroidism In the question, there is no mention of the time of diagnosis Hence we cannot say that there will be a complete restoration of IQ levels</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A This mutation is autosomal recessive The mutation given in the question is prop 1 which is the inheritance of autosomal recessive this option is true with the consequence of combined pituitary hormone deficiency and the preservation of adrenocorticotropic hormone Option: B T4 is instituted This is a case of congenital hypothyroidism These are generally based on the measurement of TSH or t4 level in the heel prick blood specimens When the diagnosis is confirmed, t4 is instituted at a dose of 10 to 15 micrograms per kg per day and the dose is adjusted by close monitoring of TSH levels T4 requirements are relatively great during the first year of life Option: D Cardiac manifestations are common This is the case of congenital hypothyroidism Congenital malformation especially cardiac manifestations are four times more common in congenital hypothyroidism and hence this option is true</p>\n<p></p>",
