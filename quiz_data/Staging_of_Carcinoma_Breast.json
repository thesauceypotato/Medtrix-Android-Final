With the only available clinical data, it is possible to make only clinical N staging. The explanation given here is for pathological N staging. N0 includes no regional lymph nodes.

T1 includes Tumours \u2264 20 mm in the most significant dimension. T2 has Tumour >20 mm but \u226450 mm in greatest dimension. T3 Tumour includes >50 mm in most-significant size. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is a benign entity removed from TNM staging in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 8th edition.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Tis refers to carcinoma in situ, meaning the cancer is confined to the ducts or lobules and has not invaded the surrounding breast tissue. Tis is a non-invasive stage of breast cancer and is sometimes referred to as pre-cancerous because it has not yet spread to other parts of the body. In breast cancer, Tis refers specifically to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) , which is a non-invasive cancer that develops in the milk ducts. DCIS cells are abnormal and can become cancerous if they invade the surrounding tissue. However, when DCIS is confined to the ducts, it is considered a pre-cancerous condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Tis staging is important because it helps to determine the appropriate treatment for breast cancer patients. Treatment options for Tis stage breast cancer typically include surgery, radiation therapy, and/or hormone therapy. It is important to note that even though Tis stage breast cancer is non-invasive, it can still develop into invasive breast cancer if left untreated. Therefore, early detection and treatment is key to successful outcomes in breast cancer patients.</p>\n<p></p>",
