      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Storage disorders can also cause dilated cardiomyopathy False, Storage disorders result in Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Cardiomyopathies: Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases of the myocardium associated with mechanical and/or electrical dysfunction that usually (but not invariably) exhibit inappropriate ventricular hypertrophy or dilatatio n and are due to a variety of causes that frequently are genetic . Cardiomyopathies either are confined to the heart or are part of generalized systemic disorders , often leading to cardiovascular death or progressive heart failure-related disability . Cardiomyopathies are anatomically divided into 3 categories: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (including arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy): Systolic dysfunction (impairment of contractility ) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy : Diastolic dysfunction (impairment of filling ) Restrictive cardiomyopathy : Diastolic dysfunction (impairment of filling ) DCM is the most common (90% of cases), and restrictive cardiomyopathy is the least frequent . Dilated Cardiomyopathy DCM is characterized morphologically and functionally by progressive cardiac dilation and contractile (systolic) dysfunction, usually with concomitant hypertrophy. Truncation mutations in TTN , a gene that encodes titin (so-called because it is the largest protein expressed in humans), may account for approximately 10% to 20% of all cases of DCM Causes of Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Genetic ( mutations in TTN ) Alcohol Peripartum Myocarditis Hemochromatosis Chronic anemia Anthracycline medications Sarcoidosis Idiopathic</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. In genetic causes, a mutation in the TTN gene is common. Correct . Option: B. Myocarditis can progress to dilated cardiomyopathy. Correct . Option: C. Alcohol abuse can also cause dilated cardiomyopathy. Correct .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Supraphysiologic stress can also result in DCM. This can happen with persistent tachycardia, hyperthyroidism, or even during development, as in the fetuses of insulin-dependent diabetic mothers . This can happen in individuals with pheochromocytomas , and tumors that elaborate epinephrine ; the use of cocaine or vasopressor agents such as dopamine can have similar consequences. Such \u201c catecholamine effect \u201d also occurs in the setting of intense autonomic stimulation , for example, secondary to intracranial lesions or emotional duress . Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an entity characterized by left ventricular contractile dysfunction after extreme psychological stress (thus also called broken heart syndrome ); the affected myocardium may be stunned or show contraction band necrosis . For unclear reasons, the left ventricular apex is most often affected, leading to \u201c apical ballooning \u201d that resembles a takotsubo, Japanese for \u201c fishing pot for trapping octopus \u201d (hence, the name).</p>\n<p></p>",

Left-sided involvement with left-sided heart failure can also occur . Classically, the right ventricular wall is severely attenuated due to the loss of myocytes , accompanied by massive fatty infiltration and focal fibrosis . Although mononuclear inflammation may be present around degenerating cardiomyocytes, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy is NOT considered inflammatory cardiomyopathy . Classical arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance; many of the causal mutations involve genes encoding desmosomal junctional proteins at the intercalated disk (e.g., plakoglobin) as well as proteins that interact with the desmosome (e.g., the intermediate filament desmin).
