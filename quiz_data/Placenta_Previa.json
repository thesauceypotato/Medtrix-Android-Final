These findings point towards diagnosing placenta previa (In abruption-bleeding is accompanied by pain; the uterus is tense, tender, and rigid). The patient's gestational age is 39 weeks, i.e., fetal maturity is attained, so pregnancy has to be terminated, either vaginally or by cesarean section. Before termination of pregnancy, a vaginal examination should be done in OT (keeping everything ready for cesarean section) to confirm the diagnosis of placenta previa.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Definition: Placenta praevia is a placenta located wholly or partly in the lower uterine segment. The bleeding is called inevitable hemorrhage as dilatation of the internal os inevitably results in bleeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Speculum examination is contraindicated in a known case of placenta previa. Option: A. The patient's gestational age is already 39 weeks, so there is no point in giving blood transfusion and sedatives. Blood transfusion is: preferred for anemia during pregnancy. Option: D. Since the patient is already at term gestation, tocolysis is contraindicated.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>FORMULATION OF THE LINE OF TREATMENT: The definitive treatment depends upon the duration of pregnancy, fetal and maternal status, and the extent of the bleeding. Expectant management Active (Definite) management Expectant treatment: The policy had been advocated by Macafee and Johnson (1945) in an attempt to improve fetal salvage without increasing undue maternal hazards. The aim is to continue the pregnancy for fetal maturity without compromising maternal health. Vital Prerequisites: (1) Availability of blood for transfusion whenever required. (2) Facilities for cesarean section should be available throughout 24 hours, if necessary. Selection of cases: Suitable cases for expectant management are: (1) Mother is in good health status (hemoglobin > 10 g%; hematocrit > 30%). (2) Duration of pregnancy is less than 37 weeks. (3) Active vaginal bleeding is absent. (4) Fetal well-being is assured (CTG and USG). Active (Definite) Management (Delivery): The definitive management (delivery) indications are: (1) Bleeding occurs at or after 37 weeks of pregnancy. (2) Patient is in labor. (3) Patient is in an exsanguinated state on admission. (4) Bleeding is continuing and of a moderate degree. (5) Baby with nonreassuring cardiac status or dead or known to be congenitally deformed.</p>\n<p></p>",
