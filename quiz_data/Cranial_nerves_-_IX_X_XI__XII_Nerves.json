Glossopharyngeal Nerve Deep structures, passing between the external and internal carotid arteries, are: The styloglossus The stylopharyngeus The glossopharyngeal nerve The pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve The styloid process A part of the parotid gland. Option B. Lingual nerve The lingual nerve continues to run anteriorly, but now it turns medially to reach the tongue, travelling between the hyoglossus and mylohyoid muscles. The nerve extends to the hyoglossus's lateral aspect and gets to its front border. Option D. Superior laryngeal nerve The superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) originates commonly from the vagus nerve at the level of the C2 vertebra and descends medially toward the thyrohyoid membrane (TM), the membrane between the thyroid cartilage and the hyoid bone.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Superficial to the carotid sheath lies the hypoglossal nerve and ansa cervicalis of the cervical plexus. The hypoglossal nerve crosses both the internal and external carotids, curving around the origin of the occipital artery. Within the sheath, between the artery and vein, and behind both, is the vagus nerve; behind the sheath, the sympathetic trunk. On the lateral side of the vessels, the accessory nerve runs for a short distance before it pierces the Sternocleidomastoid; and on the medial side of the external carotid, just below the hyoid bone, the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve may be seen.</p>\n<p></p>",

These nerves then travel superiorly in the tracheoesophageal groove to the larynx. Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve as a result of surgical intervention or the presence of a tumour in the tracheoesophageal groove would render the patient hoarse.

The left RLN passes in front of the arch, and then wraps underneath and behind it. After branching, the nerves typically ascend in a groove at the junction of the trachea and esophagus.
