During a panic attack, individuals often experience intense fear, a racing heart, shortness of breath, trembling, sweating, and a sense of impending doom. Panic disorder is commonly associated with anticipatory anxiety and agoraphobia.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry about various aspects of life, but it does not typically involve intense feelings of impending doom during a panic attack. Option B: Phobia refers to an excessive and irrational fear of a specific object, situation, or activity. It does not usually involve a general sense of impending doom. Option D: Depression is characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, changes in appetite or sleep patterns, feelings of worthlessness, and difficulty concentrating. It does not typically manifest as a specific sense of impending doom.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Panic disorder can be effectively treated with psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), Benzodiazepines. Panic disorder may coexist with other psychiatric conditions, such as major depressive disorder or substance use disorders.</p>\n<p></p>",

Exposure and response prevention: Exposure and response prevention is a therapeutic technique primarily used in the treatment of anxiety disorders, particularly obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Option B. CBT (Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy): CBT is a widely used psychotherapy approach that focuses on identifying and modifying maladaptive thoughts and behaviors. Option D. Abstinence: Abstinence refers to refraining from sexual activity. Although it may have temporary benefits, it is not considered a specific non-pharmacological management technique for premature ejaculation.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The exercise program eventually raises the threshold of the sensation of ejaculatory inevitability and allows the man to focus on sensations of arousal without anxiety and develop confidence in his sexual performance. A variant of the exercise is the stop-start technique developed by James H. Semans, in which the woman stops all stimulation of the penis when the man first senses an impending ejaculation. No squeeze is used. The squeeze technique can be combined with other behavioral techniques or used in conjunction with pharmacological treatment for optimal management of premature ejaculation.</p>\n<p></p>",
