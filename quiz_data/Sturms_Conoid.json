      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Vertical straight line In the given question, the girl is found to have simple myopic astigmatism , which means only one axis has negative or diverging power. It can be depicted by a vertical line in the Sturm's conoid diagram when the vertical rays are still diverging, and the horizontal rays have converged. Hence only the vertical meridian will have the diverging power. Astigmatism is that condition of refraction in which a point of focus of light It cannot be formed upon the retina. The optical condition is that instead of a a single focal point, there are two or more focal lines (depending on the type of astigmatism), separated from each other by a focal interval.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Etiological classification: Curvature astigmatism : Most commonly , it is corneal, where vertical curvature is more than horizontal curvature (due to the pressure of the upper eyelid), less commonly, it is lenticular (induced by lens). Decentering astigmatism : subluxation of lens. Index astigmatism : due to cataract in one meridian.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Horizontal oval denotes compound hypermetropic with the rule astigmatism. Option: B. Circle denotes mixed astigmatism. Option: D.

This will improve the varying degrees of both regular and irregular astigmatism. Other Surgeries : Astigmatic keratotomy - we make radial or arcuate cuts in the mid periphery perpendicular to the steepest corneal meridian. Astigmatic epi-LASIK is preferred over PRK, just as in the case of spherical errors. Astigmatic PRK -- it uses a cylinder rather than spherical ablation. Astigmatic C-LASIK.
