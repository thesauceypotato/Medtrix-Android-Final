The structure marked by black arrow is the sensory root Black arrow- dorsal horn, the sensory root, is responsible for the afferent pathway. Option: B. The structure marked by a blue arrow is responsible for the autonomic supply. Blue arrow- lateral horn is responsible for the autonomic supply. It is present only in those parts of the spinal cord where sympathetic or parasympathetic nerves originate. Option: C . The structure marked by an orange arrow is the efferent pathway.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Preganglionic myelinated fibers In the given question, the fibers that travel through white rami communicans are mostly myelinated and preganglionic. After relaying in the sympathetic ganglion, the post-ganglionic fibers will travel through gray rami communicans which mostly contain non-myelinated fibers. White rami communicans can also have non-myelinated fibers when carrying general sensation from the viscera. Hence the correct answer to this question is option B.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The white rami communicantes are the preganglionic sympathetic outflow from the spinal cord. The cell bodies for the preganglionic sympathetic myelinated fibers in the white rami communicantes lie in the ipsilateral intermediolateral cell column in the spinal cord, which extends from T1-L2. These rami also contain general visceral afferent fibers (sensory from the organs) whose primary cell bodies reside in dorsal root ganglia (which then synapse in the dorsal horn). The preganglionic sympathetic fibers will enter the sympathetic trunk and either synapse at the ganglion on the same level or travel up or down the sympathetic trunk to arrive at the correct spinal level for their action. Once they synapse in the sympathetic ganglion in the sympathetic trunk, they exit the trunk as gray rami to join the spinal nerve and innervate the appropriate structure.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Preganglionic Non-Myelinated Fibers Option: C. Post ganglionic non-myelinated fibers Option: D.

A small lateral gray column or horn is present in the cord's thoracic and upper lumbar segments. The amount of gray matter present at any given spinal cord level is related to the amount of muscle Innervated at that level. Thus, its size is greatest within the cervical and lumbosacral enlargements of the cord, which innervate the muscles of the upper and lower limbs, respectively.</p>\n<p></p>",
