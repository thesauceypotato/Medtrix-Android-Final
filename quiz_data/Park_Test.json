Park three-step test- Identify the hypertropic eye in the primary (straight-ahead) position. This implies that either one of the two depressors of the hypertropic eye or one of the two elevators of the hypotropic eye is weak. So in this case, right eye is hypertropic so either depressor of right eye (RSO or RIR) is affected or elevators of the left eye affected (LSR or LIO) Ask the patient to look horizontally right and then left and see in which position the deviation is more. Deviation increase in the direction of paralysed muscle. In this, as the patient look to the left, deviation increases so either RSO (acts in adducted position) or LSR is affected (acts in abducted position of the eye.) Step 3. Tilt the patient's head towards each shoulder and see in which direction the vertical squint increases Remembering that on tilting the head towards one shoulder, the eye on the same side intorts and the other eye extorts.

Hence the group of muscles that will be affected in this will be either the right depressor ( RSO or RIR ) or the left elevator (LIO or LSR ). In the 2nd step of the park test, we will ask the patient to look to the right or left side to see in which direction the deviation increases . In the given question, as the affected muscle is right superior oblique, hence we can make out in which direction the deviation will increase because of it. As the deviation increases in the direction of paralysed muscle, on looking left the deviation will increase in this patient. So the muscles now which can still be affected are RSO or LSR.
