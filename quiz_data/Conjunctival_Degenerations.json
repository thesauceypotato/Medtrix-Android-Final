It consists of fatty tissue and the surrounding dermis-like connective tissue, hence the name lipodermoid. Sometimes, the peribulbar dermoid or lipodermoids may be associated with accessory auricles and other congenital defects ( Goldenhar's syndrome). Both limbal dermoid and dermal lipomas are more common in children with a congenital developmental anomaly known as Goldenharsyndrome (oculoauriculovertebral dysplasia) .

Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP), also known as ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP), comprises a group of chronic autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering diseases. Diagnosis is principally clinical, but a biopsy of the involved mucous membrane often shows supportive changes ( linear antibody and complement BMZ deposition). Fine lines of subconjunctival fibrosis and shortening of the inferior fornices is a typical features of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Cicatricial pemphigoid is a chronic disease that affects mucosal surfaces typically in the elderly population.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid is usually bilateral (but may be very asymmetric) and associated with chronic conjunctivitis. This leads to subconjunctival fibrosis and a drop in the number of goblet cells. Subconjunctival fibrosis also may lead to obstruction of the ducts of the lacrimal and accessory lacrimal glands. Option: C. Monitoring should include the measurement of fornical depth and noting the position of adhesions. Systemic treatment is the mainstay of management. Any detectable inflammatory activity should be suppressed. Dapsone (diamino diphenyl sulfone) is a useful first-line treatment in patients with mild\u2013moderate disease. Approximately 70% of patients respond favorably. Mucous membrane autografting or amniotic membrane transplantation can be done for conjunctival resurfacing and fornical restoration. Option D: Scleritis is not associated with this disease process. Progression usually results in symblepharon, foreshortening of the fornices, and ankyloblepharon. Keratinization of the conjunctival epithelium, as well as corneal neovascularization and scarring, are characteristic of end-stage ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Immunoglobulins at the level of the basement membrane can be seen with immunofluorescent stains.</p>\n<p></p>",

Types . : Based on the extent, pterygium has been described of three types: Type I pterygium extends less than 2 mm onto the cornea. Type 2 pterygium involves up to 4 mm of the cornea. Type 3 pterygium encroaches onto more than 4 mm of the cornea and involves the visual axis. Depending upon the progression, it may be progressive or regressive pterygium . Progressive pterygium is thick, fleshy, and vascular with a few whitish infiltrates in the cornea, in front of the head of the pterygium known as Fuchs spots or islets of Vogt also called cap of pterygium. Regressive pterygium is thin, atrophic, and attenuated with very little vascularity. There is no cap, but deposition of iron (Stocker's line) may be seen sometimes, just anterior to the head of the pterygium. Ultimately, it becomes membranous but never disappears.</p>\n<p></p>",
