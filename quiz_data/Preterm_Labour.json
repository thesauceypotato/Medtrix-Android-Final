The natural history of abruption is an extension of the separation, leading to complete shearing of the placenta from the uterus. If this happens , delivery would be the best treatment, with administering antenatal steroids to decrease the chance of respiratory distress syndrome in the preterm baby. Expectant management may be exercised if the patient is stable with no active bleeding or no sign of fetal compromise since this is a premature fetus. Nevertheless, giving tocolytics would increase the chance of hemorrhage in mothers after delivery because it will be more challenging to get the uterus to contract on itself since tocolytics also act as a uterine relaxant.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Shape of cervix Seen in T shaped Normal Y shaped Suspicious of preterm labor U shaped Funneling of os-seen in incompetent os, preterm labor</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B.

Either betamethasone 12 mg I.M 24 hours apart for 2 doses or dexamethasone 6 mg I.M every 12 hours for 4 doses given. maternal administration of steroids is advocated where the pregnancy is < 34 weeks. this helps in fetal lung maturation so that the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), necroting enterocolitis (NEC) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) are minimised. This is beneficial when the delivery is delayed beyond 48 hours of the 1st dose. Option C. Prednisone is the corticosteroid but not given in case of preterm labour as it mainly works on the immune system to help reduce swelling, redness and allergic reactions. Low-dose prednisone may help increase sperm motility and pregnancy rates for some people with infertility. Option D.
