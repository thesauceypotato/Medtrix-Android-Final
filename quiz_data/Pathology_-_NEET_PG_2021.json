      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Thymoma The most probable cause of red cell aplasia in a patient with a mediastinal mass is C. Thymoma . Thymomas can be associated with various paraneoplastic syndromes, including pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). Thymomas can produce factors or antibodies that suppress erythropoiesis, leading to red cell aplasia. The mechanism of PRCA in thymoma may involve autoimmune or immunological processes that disrupt normal red blood cell production.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Pure red cell aplasia It is an uncommon disorder in which maturation arrest occurs in the formation of erythrocytes. Erythroblasts are virtually absent in bone marrow; however, white blood cell and platelet production are normal. The anemia due to PRCA is usually normocytic but can be macrocytic. Typical features: Severe anemia Reticulocyte count < 1% The presence of less than 0.5% mature erythroblasts in the bone marrow Normocellular bone marrow in most cases Maturation arrest is evidenced by the presence of more immature erythrocyte progenitors. Congenital PRCA is a lifelong disorder and is associated with physical abnormalities. PRCA can be transient and reversible: Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC) can occur after viral infections. PRCA due to medications and infections are often reversible. In adults, most cases of chronic PRCA are idiopathic. Secondary PRCA occurs in patients with conditions such as the following: Autoimmune disorders Thymomas Systemic lupus erythematosus Hematologic malignancies Solid tumors Here, it is important to note that PRCA affects only the erythropoietic cells leading to reticulocytopenia and anemia. WBC and platelet counts are normal, thus differentiating it from aplastic anemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A.

The hallmark of PNH is the presence of abnormal red blood cells susceptible to hemolysis due to a deficiency of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins on the cell surface. Option D.
