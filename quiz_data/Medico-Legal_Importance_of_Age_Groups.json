The system uses a two-number system for the location and naming of each tooth. The jaw is divided into four quadrants between the central incisors and the upper and lower dental arches. The first number refers to the quadrant of a tooth: right upper quadrant = 1, left upper quadrant = 2, left lower quadrant = 3, right lower quadrant = 4 The second number refers to the individual tooth within a specific quadrant: Central incisor = 1, lateral incisor = 2, canine = 3, 1st premolar = 4, 2nd premolar = 5, 1st molar = 6, 2nd molar = 7, 3rd molar = 8 The notation \"21\" would therefore refer to the permanent left upper central incisor.</p>\n<p></p>",
