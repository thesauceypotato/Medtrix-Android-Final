The term \"bipotent\" refers to the embryo's capability to develop into either male or female structures, which is true up until about the sixth week of development. By the eighth week, sexual differentiation is already underway, with the influence of the SRY gene causing the gonads to differentiate into testes in 46XY embryos. This differentiation results in a shift away from bipotency, making the embryo committed to developing male characteristics.</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

These youngsters are commonly brought up as girls until they reach puberty, at which point they begin to display signs of masculinization due to the influence of testosterone. As a result, clitoromegaly becomes evident. The absence of estrogen conversion from testosterone results in limited breast growth. Scanty pubic hair is observed since its growth is contingent on both testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 17 alpha hydroxylase deficiency : Leads to reduced formation of corticosteroids, sex hormones and increased mineralocorticoids (causing hypokalemia and hypertension).

Patient with XX chromosome lacks secondary sexual development.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 17 alpha hydroxylase deficiency</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Androgen insensitivity syndrome : Defect in androgen receptor resulting in female-appearing genetic male (46, XY); female external genitalia with scant axillary and pubic hair, rudimentary vagina; uterus and fallopian tubes absent due to persistence of anti-Mullerian hormone from testes. Patients develop normal functioning testes. Patient has increased testosterone, estrogen & LH as compared to other sex chromosome disorders.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.
