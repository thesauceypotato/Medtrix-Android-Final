It is also used to prevent infections during surgery.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Upper utis (pyelonephritis) require more aggressive & longer treatment. Since pyelonephritis may damage the kidney/ give rise to septicaemia, it may be treated with a potent parenteral antibacterial such as cefuroxime, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, gentamicin or levofloxacin. The usual duration of treatment is 10\u201314 days, but longer treatment may be required.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A . Phenazopyridine, a urinary analgesic, is an orange dye which exerts analgesic action in the urinary tract & affords symptomatic relief of burning sensation, dysuria & urgency due to cystitis. It does not have antibacterial properties. Hence it cannot be used in case of bacterial pyelonephritis. Option: B. Nitrofurantoin & option c. Methenamine - are urinary antiseptics, which are orally administered amas which attain antibacterial concentration only in urine not in the kidney, with no systemic antibacterial effect.
