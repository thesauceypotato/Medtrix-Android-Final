The pathogenesis phase begins with the entry of the disease \"agent\" in the susceptible human host. Option: C. The further events in the pathogenesis phase are clear-cut in infectious diseases, i.e., the disease. agent multiplies and induces tissue and physiological changes, the disease progresses through a period of incubation and later through early and late pathogenesis. The outcome of the disease may be recovery, disability, or death. Intervention measures such as immunization and chemotherapy may modify the pathogenesis phase. Option: D. At this stage that the host's reaction to infection with a disease agent is not predictable(OPTION D). The infection may be clinical or sub-clinical, typical or atypical, or the host may become a carrier with or without having developed clinical disease, as in the case of diphtheria and poliomyelitis. The early pathogenesis phase is less dramatic in chronic diseases (e.g., coronary heart disease, hypertension, cancer). This phase in chronic diseases is referred to as the presymptomatic phase. During the presymptomatic stage, there is no manifest disease. The pathological changes are essentially below the level of the \"clinical horizon.\" The clinical stage begins when recognizable signs or symptoms appear. By the time signs and symptoms appear, the disease phase is already well advanced into the late pathogenesis phase. Hence screening lay a role here.</p>\n<p></p>",

This is an example of a common source and continued exposure epidemic as the cases occurred when the infectious agent (S. typhi ) persists in the common vehicle (carrier) for some amount of time. The final decline of an epidemic occurs either because the cause of contamination is removed or because all the susceptible have become infected. The epidemic curve rises slowly and also falls gradually. The peak of the curve is not sharp; but rather plateau-like, and the duration of the epidemic is stretched out, depending on the duration for which contamination had persisted in the vehicle. The epidemic curve will have a single peak & all cases have occurred within 1 incubation period \u2013 This is the feature of a common source single exposure epidemic.

Common-source, single-exposure epidemics are also known as \"point-source\" epidemics. The exposure to the disease agent is brief and essentially simultaneous.

Common-source epidemics arise from the same source of exposure. These epidemics can either be of a single exposure or multiple exposures depending upon the incubation period. If all the cases develop within one incubation period, it is called Common-source, single exposure and if there is more than one incubation period, it is called Common-source, multiple/continuous exposure.
