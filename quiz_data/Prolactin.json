      "text": "A 44-year-old woman presents to her gynecologist with complaints of not having a period for the last 8 months. She reports a negative pregnancy test at home. Upon further questioning, she reports a daily headache, changes in vision, and a milky discharge from the breast. She has no medical problems and is not taking any medications. On physical examination, she is noted to have galactorrhea and diminished peripheral vision bilaterally. The remainder of her examination is normal. A pregnancy test is repeated and is negative. A thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is drawn and is normal. Her serum prolactin level is elevated significantly. What is the most probable diagnosis of this case?",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pituitary adenoma She is found to have a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Elevated prolactin and amenorrhea: Elevated prolactin levels inhibit pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. Thyroid disease and elevated prolactin: Hypothyroidism is associated with an elevated thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) level that increases the secretion of prolactin. Synthesis of the posterior pituitary hormones: Hypothalamic nuclei-hormones are synthesized in nerve cell bodies, packaged in secretory granules, and transported down the nerve axon to the posterior pituitary.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Rest all options are incorrect because these cause low prolactin not High .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The regulation of prolactin secretion differs from that of the other pituitary hormones in that PRL secretion is under tonic inhibition from the hypothalamus. If the hypothalamohypophysial portal system is disrupted, PRL secretion increases rather than decreases as is the case for the other pituitary hormones. Most evidence points to dopamine rather than a peptide as being the prolactin inhibitory hormone. In addition to this inhibitory pathway, PRL secretion can be stimulated by TRH. The main target of PRL is the mammary gland, which promotes the secretion of colostrum and milk. PRL levels rise during pregnancy. After parturition, basal levels fall, but there are spikes in PRL levels during and after periods of nursing. in The spikes in PRL secretion are because of neural signals from the breast acting at the level of the hypothalamus to decrease dopamine release into the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal system. This reflex and the high levels of PRL suppress the hypothalamic secretion of GnRH, thus inhibiting the menstrual cycle.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dopamine One of the main regulators of the production of prolactin from the pituitary gland is the hormone called dopamine, which is produced by the hypothalamus, the part of the brain directly above the pituitary gland. Dopamine restrains prolactin production , so the more dopamine there is, the less prolactin is released.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>It is believed that anterior pituitary secretion of prolactin is controlled either entirely or almost entirely by an inhibitory factor formed in the hypothalamus and transported through the hypothalamic hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary gland. This factor is sometimes called prolactin inhibitory hormone, but it is almost certainly the same as the catecholamine dopamine, which is known to be secreted by the arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus and can decrease prolactin secretion as much as 10-fold. This can be accounted by the fact that dopamine antagonists increase milk production leading to galactorrhea as a side effect and dopamine agonists are used to arrest milk secretion following an IUD or stillbirth.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that mediates satisfaction, happiness, and optimism. Option B. GABA is known for producing a calming effect. It's thought to play a major role in controlling nerve cell hyperactivity associated with anxiety, stress, and fear. Option C.
