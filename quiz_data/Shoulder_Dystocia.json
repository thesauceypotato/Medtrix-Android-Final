The recoil of the head back against the perineum refers to the turtle neck sign. Definition: The term shoulder dystocia describes a wide range of additional obstetric maneuvers to deliver the fetus after the head has been born and gentle traction has failed to deliver the shoulder. Shoulder dystocia occurs when either the anterior or the posterior (rare) fetal shoulder impacts the maternal symphysis or the sacral promontory, respectively. Risk factors: 1. Previous shoulder dystocia, 2. Macrosomia ( > 4.5 kg), 3. Diabetes (STATEMENT 1) 4. Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) (STATEMENT2) 5. Induced labor, 6. Prolonged first stage or second stage of labor, 7. Secondary arrest of labor, 8. Postmaturity, 9. Multiparity, 10. Anencephaly (STATEMENT4) 11. Mid-pelvic instrumental delivery (more following ventouse than forceps) (STATEMENT3) 12.
