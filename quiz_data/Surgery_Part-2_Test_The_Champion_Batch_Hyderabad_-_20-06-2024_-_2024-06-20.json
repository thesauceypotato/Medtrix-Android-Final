Intravesical BCG followed by chemotherapy: Intravesical BCG is typically used for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). It is effective in reducing recurrence and progression of superficial bladder cancer but is not adequate for muscle-invasive disease. Option B. Systemic chemotherapy: While systemic chemotherapy can be used as part of the treatment plan, especially in a neoadjuvant setting (before surgery) or for metastatic disease, it is not the primary treatment of choice for muscle-invasive bladder cancer without metastatic disease. Option C. Radical cystectomy: Radical cystectomy is the standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. It involves the removal of the bladder and surrounding tissues/organs (such as prostate in men and uterus in women), and it provides the best chance for long-term survival and disease control.
