Injury to the pelvic floor muscles causes urethral hypermobility and urethral prolapse. Prolapse of the bladder causes vaginal bulge in this patient. With the rise in intra-abdominal pressures, bladder pressure rises and simultaneous loss of urine occurs. Urethral hypermobility includes the Q tip test which determines whether the patient has an abnormal urethrovesical angle. It is done by placing the patient in a dorsal lithotomy position and inserting a cotton swab into the urethral orifice. An angle of greater than or equal to 30 degrees from horizontal on increasing intra-abdominal pressure signifies urethral hypermobility. Urinalysis and post-void residual volume should be normal ( < 150 mL in women and < 50ml in men ). First-line treatment - kegel exercise . Unresponsive cases may require urethral sling surgery.
