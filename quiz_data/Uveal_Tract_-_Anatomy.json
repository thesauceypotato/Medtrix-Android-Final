It is a thin circular disc corresponding to the diaphragm of a camera. In its center is an aperture of about 4 mm diameter called a pupil, which regulates the amount of light reaching the retina .

It is the anterior-most condensed part of the stroma. It consists of melanocytes and fibroblasts. Previously, this layer was called the endothelial layer of the iris, which was a misnomer. This layer is deficient in the areas of crypts. The definitive colour of the iris depends on this layer. In the blue iris, this layer is thin and contains few pigment cells. While in the brown iris, it is Thick and densely pigmented. Iris stroma . It consists of loosely arranged collagenous networks that embed the sphincter pupillae muscle, dilator pupillae muscle, vessels, nerves, pigment cells, and other cells, including lymphocytes, fibroblasts, macrophages, and mast cells. Sphincter pupillae muscle forms a one-millimeter broad circular band in the pupillary part of the iris. Parasympathetic fibers supply it through the third nerve. It constricts the pupil.

CAROTID-CAVERNOUS FISTULA Carotid-cavernous fistula is an acquired abnormal communication between the carotid arterial system and the venous cavernous sinus . Clinical types There are two types of carotid-cavernous fistula: High-flow fistula is secondary to trauma or iatrogenic and presents acutely with pain and proptosis (often pulsatile exophthalmos). Chemosis, congestion, bruit, ophthalmoplegia (nerve palsies), headache, and objective pulsatile tinnitus. The classical triad of presentation is proptosis, chemosis, and bruit .
