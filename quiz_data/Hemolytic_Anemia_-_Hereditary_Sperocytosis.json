Intracorpuscular acquired cause of intravascular hemolysis. Patients generally present with episodic early morning Hematuria. A significant advancement in treating this disease is the introduction of a monoclonal antibody Eculizumab in 2007. This antibody binds to the complement component c5 near the site that, when cleaved, will trigger the formation of the MAC. With the c5 blocked, there is no intravascular hemolysis. Hence for many PNH patients, Eculizumab is a real improvement in quality of life with reduced associated complications, especially thrombosis. A. Allogenic BMT This is a definitive cure with the cost of non-negligible risks, but the latter is more effective after the discovery of Eculizumab in 2007. B.

Speen modifies the membrane of RBC to have the least surface area to volume ratio(sphere).due to this, excessive destruction of RBCs is prevented. Abnormal red cells with decreased membrane surface area and increased sphericity are trapped in the spleen and phagocytosed. MCV is reduced in reticulocytes as well. MCHC is increased Erythropoiesis is stimulated due to red cell destruction, which is done by EPO released from the kidney. This maintains a balance between destruction n production. Here the hemolysis is said to be compensated . Hence no anemia in compensated hemolysis. This anemia can become decompensated anemia and may suddenly reappear in cases like pregnancy, folate deficiency, and renal failure.</p>\n<p></p>",
