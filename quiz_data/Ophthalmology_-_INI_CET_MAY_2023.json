      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Nodular episcleritis The image shows a nodule surrounded by redness. On administration of phenylephrine blanching of superficial episcleral vessels is seen .Hence the probable diagnosis is nodular episcleritis</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Phenylephrine is a drug that can be used to distinguish between episcleritis and scleritis. In episcleritis, a drop of phenylephrine 2.5% causes visible blanching of the episcleral vessels, but will not do so in scleritis. The redness of episcleritis should improve with instillation of phenylephrine, as the episcleral vessels constrict, but the redness of scleritis should not improve. Clinically two type of presentation may occur: Simple episcleritis is characterized by sectorial or diffuse inflammation of the episclera. Nodular episcleritis is characterized by pink or purple flat nodule surrounded by injection.Usually situated 2-3 mm away from the limbus. The nodule is firm and tender and can be moved separately from the sclera and the overlying conjunctivitis. Type of scleritis Anterior scleritis: the most common type, affecting the front of the It can be non-necrotising (diffuse or nodular) or necrotising (with or without inflammation). Posterior scleritis: a rare type, affecting the back of the It can cause complications such as retinal detachment or optic nerve compression. Exogenous scleritis: caused by external factors such as trauma, surgery, or Endogenous scleritis: caused by systemic diseases such as syphilis or tuberculosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option A. Nodular scleritis: Scleritis is a more severe inflammation involving the deeper layers of the sclera. Nodular scleritis presents as nodules on the sclera. Similar to nodular episcleritis, blanching of vascularity after phenylephrine use would be inconsistent with the expected response in nodular scleritis. Option C.Nodular phlyctenular conjunctivitis also called; Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis is a nodular inflammation of the cornea or conjunctiva that results from a hypersensitivity reaction to a foreign antigen . Blanching of vascularity after phenylephrine use is not typically associated with nodular phlycten . Option D. Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is inflammation of the outermost layer of the white part of the eye and the inner surface of the Blanching of vascularity after phenylephrine use is not specific to conjunctivitis and may not be a significant diagnostic feature.</p>\n<p></p>",

During direct gonioscopy, the viewer has an erect view of the angle Direct gonioscopy is most easily performed with the patient supine and in the operating room for an exam under anesthesia or a MIGS procedure. Indirect gonioscopy Examples of indirect gonioscopy lenses include the Posner, Sussman, Zeiss, and Goldmann lenses . These are more commonly used in the clinic setting.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Isopter contraction and baring of blind spot Glaucoma change on perimeter is typically an isopter contraction and baring of the blind spot.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Glaucoma typically involves elevated intraocular pressure (pressure inside the eye), which can lead to damage to the optic nerve fibers over time. This damage often results in gradual and irreversible vision loss, starting with peripheral (side) vision and potentially progressing to central vision if not managed properly. The optic nerve changes in glaucoma primarily involve Isopter contraction refers to mild generalized constriction of both peripheral and central Although it is the earliest but little diagnostic significance occurring in glaucoma. Optic Nerve Head Cupping: One of the most characteristic changes in glaucoma is the cupping of the optic nerve head . This refers to the enlargement and excavation of the central part of the optic nerve head (the point where the nerve fibers leave the eye and enter the brain). As the nerve fibers are damaged and die, this area becomes hollowed out , resembling a \u201ccup .\u201d This cupping can be measured and quantified to monitor the progression of the disease. Nerve Fiber Layer Thinning : The loss of nerve fibers due to glaucoma results in a thinning of the nerve fiber layer that surrounds the optic nerve This can often be observed through imaging techniques like optical coherence tomography (OCT), which can visualize and measure the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer. Visual Field Defects : As the optic nerve damage progresses, visual field defects These are areas of the visual field where vision is impaired or lost. In glaucoma, these defects typically start at the periphery and can progress to involve more central areas of vision if the disease is not effectively managed. Optic Nerve Blood Flow Changes : Glaucoma can affect the blood flow to the optic nerve, potentially contributing to its damage. Reduced blood flow can further compromise the health of the nerve fibers</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option A: Static perimetry Used in quantification and tracking of visual changes in established glaucoma. constant and moved centrally with detection. Option B: In kinetic perimetry (not static perimetry) stimulus intensity is held,it is used to map a patient\u2019s hill of vision in order to identify regions of normal and abnormal sensitivity to light Option C: Optic disc changes are much greater than visual field changes. Therefore visual field defects need not correspond to optic nerve head abnormalities to be classified as glaucoma.</p>\n<p></p>",
