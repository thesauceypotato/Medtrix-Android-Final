It is characterised by an irregular atrial rate greater than 100 beats per minute (bpm) . Atrial activity is well organised, with at least 3 morphologically distinct P waves, irregular P-P intervals, and an isoelectric baseline between the P waves Recent guidelines recommend the use of beta-blockers and CCB for rate control and ongoing management of MAT.
