      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Turner syndrome with webbed neck is 3 times more likely to develop CVS defects than non webbed neck > C. [A. Turner syndrome with webbed neck is 3 times more likely to develop CVS defects than non webbed neck; C. Male turner (Noonan syndrome) is much more likely to have CVS defects] Turner syndrome is 45, XO and thus occurs only in females while Noonan syndrome occurs due to somatic gene mutations in genes involved in RAS\u2013 MAPK pathway, with PTPN missense mutations being seen in >50% patients and thus can be seen in both males and females. Phenotypically, both syndromes appear similar and have overlapping features, including webbed neck and increased risk of congenital heart disease. Most common congenital heart disease in turner syndrome is bicuspid aortic valve, followed by coarctation of aorta. Most common congenital heart disease in Noonan syndrome is pulmonic stenosis. Regarding webbed neck due to any cause, it is associated with both flow-related as well as non-flow related cardiac defects. The webbed neck produces increased lymphatic pressure due to jugular lymphatic sac obstruction in a fetus, this compresses the ascending aorta. This further causes redirection of intracardiac blood flow, leading to coarctation of aorta. The largest multicentric study says that prevalence of CoA in turner syndrome is about 30% in webbed neck and 9\u201310% in normal neck. Thereby implying 3-fold increased risk of CoA in webbed neck Turner syndrome, versus non-webbed neck. Now confusion can arise from option C, since some older studies have reported that Noonan syndrome has association of cardiac disease in 70% cases, while Turner syndrome has association in 40% cases. However, this association is for detectable cardiac lesions like CoA and does not consider bicuspid aortic valve which are often asymptomatic. Also, Noonan syndrome is not a single lesion but a large spectrum of similar morphology due to specific pathway defects. Incidence of such high cardiac disease association has not been found to be consistently associated with all forms.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Turner syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 2500 newborn phenotypic females. Karyotypic Abnormalities: The most common karyotype observed in Turner syndrome is 45X, indicating a missing X chromosome. However, mosaic forms like 45X/46XX and 45X/46XY can also be seen. Clinical Features: Short Stature: Girls with Turner syndrome typically have a short stature. Phenotypic Characteristics: At birth, Turner syndrome may be identified by the presence of lymphedema, cystic hygroma, and left-sided obstructive cardiac lesions. Childhood Features: Other features in childhood may include cubitus valgus (wide carrying angle), shield chest with widely spaced nipples, webbed neck, and a short fourth metacarpal bone. Cardiac Associations: Common cardiac associations include coarctation of the aorta, mitral valve prolapse, and aortic stenosis. Renal Malformations: Renal malformations like horseshoe kidney, duplication of renal pelvis, and agenesis may be present. Endocrine Associations: Turner syndrome can be associated with hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

At that time (during the mid-gestation, 12\u201322 weeks), the major steroid products are DHEA and DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S). During mid-gestation (12\u201322 weeks), the aromatase activity and Sulfo kinase activity increases. So placenta itself utilizes fetal DHEA and DHEA-S as substrate for estrone and estradiol as precursors.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The fetal adrenal gland is a critical component of the endocrine system during pregnancy and plays a significant role in producing various hormones. Among the steroids produced by the fetal adrenal gland, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) is the most abundant. DHEA-S is a precursor hormone, meaning it serves as a building block for the synthesis of other hormones, particularly sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone. DHEA-S production begins early in fetal development and continues throughout pregnancy, reaching its peak during the third trimester. DHEA-S is mainly synthesized in the zona reticularis of the fetal adrenal cortex.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION B. Cortisol: Produced in the fetal adrenal cortex, cortisol aids in promoting fetal organ maturation and cardiovascular development. OPTION C. Corticosterone: Another steroid hormone from the adrenal glands, but less studied than cortisol or DHEA-S in fetal development. OPTION D. Progesterone: Produced by the corpus luteum in the ovaries during pregnancy, and while present in the fetal adrenal gland, it is not the maximum steroid produced during fetal development.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The hormone levels in the fetal circulation are tightly regulated by a complex interplay of factors involving the placenta, fetal pituitary gland, and other endocrine organs. DHEA-S is essential for the development of the fetus and plays a role in promoting fetal growth and maturation. After birth, the production of DHEA-S significantly decreases, and the adrenal gland's focus shifts to producing other hormones like cortisol and aldosterone.</p>\n<p></p>",
