On admission, her blood glucose was 30 mg/dl, and she has had five similar episodes since then, requiring treatment with high dextrose (D25%), octreotide, and glucagon. Each time, her blood glucose was critically low (20-40 mg/dl) with a high insulin level (3500-4000 pmol/L). During this hospital stay, needle marks were observed on both of her deltoids, and she appeared unusually calm during injections. C-peptide levels were checked and found to be nearly negligible.
