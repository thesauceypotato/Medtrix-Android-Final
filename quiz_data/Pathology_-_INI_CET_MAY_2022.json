The T and B lymphocytes (T and B Cells) are involved in the acquired or antigen-specific immune response given that they are the only cells in the organism able to recognize and respond specifically to each antigenic epitope. The B Cells have the ability to transform into plasmocytes and are responsible for producing antibodies (Abs). Thus, humoral immunity depends on the B Cells while cell immunity depends on the T Cells. Lymphocytes in human circulating blood are approximately 80 to 90 percent T cells, and 10 to 20 percent B cells. T and B cells exhibit a common theme of recognition/binding of specific antigens via a complementary receptor, followed by activation and self-amplification/maturation to specifically bind to the particular antigen of the infecting pathogen. T and B lymphocytes are also similar in that each cell only expresses one type of antigen receptor. Any individual may possess a population of T and B cells that together express a near limitless variety of antigen receptors that are capable of recognizing virtually any infecting pathogen. T and B cells are activated when they recognize small components of antigens, called epitopes , presented by APCs, illustrated in Figure. In this figure, the entire structure is an antigen, and the orange, salmon and green components projecting from it represent potential epitopes. Note that recognition occurs at a specific epitope rather than on the entire antigen; for this reason, epitopes are known as \u201cantigenic determinants.\u201d In the absence of information from APCs, T and B cells remain inactive, or na\u00efve, and are unable to prepare an immune response.

Most stains for mast cells rely on the cell's content of heparin, other glycosaminoglycans, and esterase. Acidic proteoglycans in mast cells interact with the basic dye Toluidine blue and give dark blue color to help detect histamine release. Mast cells are found in the connective tissue and their cytoplasm contains granules (metachromatic) composed of heparin and histamine. Toluidine blue should stain mast cells red-purple (metachromatic staining) and the background blue (orthochromatic staining). In other words, mast cells stain metachromatically with toluidine blue with greater intensity in cells containing smaller granules . Metachromasia, tissue elements staining a different color from the dye solution, is due to the pH, dye concentration and temperature of the basic dye. Blue or violet dyes will show a red color shift, and red dyes will show a yellow color shift with metachromatic tissue elements.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - A type of white blood cell that surrounds and kills microorganisms, removes dead cells, and stimulates the action of other immune system cells.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization FISH technique is shown in the image. The basic elements of FISH are a DNA probe and a target sequence. Before hybridization, the DNA probe is labeled by various means, such as nick translation, random primed labeling, and PCR. Two labeling strategies are commonly used: indirect labeling (left panel) and direct labeling (right panel). For indirect labeling, probes are labeled with modified nucleotides that contain a Hapten, whereas direct labeling uses nucleotides that have been directly modified to contain a fluorophore. The labeled probe and the target DNA are denatured. Combining the denatured probe and target allows the annealing of complementary DNA sequences. If the probe has been labeled indirectly, an extra step is required for visualization of the nonfluorescent hapten that uses an enzymatic or immunological detection system. Whereas FISH is faster with directly labeled probes, indirect labeling offers the advantage of signal amplification by using several layers of antibodies, and it might therefore produce a signal that is brighter compared with background levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: Sanger sequencing is a method of DNA sequencing that involves electrophoresis and is based on the random incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides by DNA polymerase during in vitro DNA replication .

Epidemiological studies have indicated that HIV\u2010infected individuals may have a slightly increased incidence of low grade non\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma compared to the general population, estimated as a 14\u2010fold increased risk among HIV\u2010infected patients previously diagnosed with an AIDS\u2010defining illness. Option B - Women diagnosed with early invasive cervical cancer can usually be cured with effective treatment. It is important for health-care providers at all levels to be able to recognize and promptly manage common symptoms and signs of cervical cancer. HIV infection and low CD4+ T-cell count are associated with an increased risk of persistent oncogenic HPV infection \u2013 the major risk factor for cervical cancer. Few reported prospective cohort studies have characterized the incidence of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) in HIV-infected women. Option C - Kaposi's sarcoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lining of blood and lymph vessels.

Target cells adopt a \u201cbullseye\u201d morphology where hemoglobin is concentrated in the center and on the periphery with a colourless zone in between the two areas. Other target cells may also look folded or bell shaped. Target cells have an increased surface area to volume ratio and decreased osmotic fragility (The target cell membrane is thinner than normal cells) Liver Disease: membrane cholesterol concentration is reduced, decreasing the tensile strength of the membrane, resulting in target cell formation Artefact: Target cell formation occurs when blood smears are made when humidity is high. Hemoglobinopathies: There is an uneven distribution of hemoglobin within the cell, and an increased surface area to volume ratio. Option C: Poikilocytosis is variation in cell shape: poikilocyte may be oval, teardrop-shaped, sickle-shaped or irregularly contracted. Generally, poikilocytosis can refer to an increase in abnormal red blood cells of any shape where they make up 10% or more of the total population.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Entosis Cell in cell phenomena: Entosis: Invasion of a cell in another cell\u2019s cytoplasm which has the same size Seen in tumor cells Emperipolesis Active penetration of one cell into another one with smaller size No damage to cell wall Seen in autoimmune hepatitis ALSO NOTE: There are 6 major differences in Necrosis and Apoptosis. Cell death reasons - Necrosis is always pathological , which means cell death happens because of unfavorable stressful situations (infections, excessive heat, radiation or lack of blood supply). Apoptosis is most commonly physiological ; it is programmed cell death which eliminates unwanted cells from the body. Sometimes apoptosis happens in cells with damaged DNA. Cell Size - Cell size increases in Necrosis and cell Shrinks in Apoptosis. Nucleus - In Necrosis nucleus undergo pyknosis, fragmentation and karyolysis. Apoptotic nucleus breaks into nucleosome size fragments. Plasma membrane - there is loss of plasma membrane integrity in necrosis, but plasma membrane remains intact in apoptosis. Cellular contents - In necrosis there is leakage of cellular contents Adjacent Inflammation - Because there is Plasma membrane rupture there is leakage of contents which attracts inflammatory cells, so there is inflammation in necrosis. Apoptotic bodies are phagocytosed so there is no cellular material to induce inflammation hence there is no inflammation in Apoptosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - Necrosis is the death of body tissue. It occurs when too little blood flows to the tissue. This can be from injury, radiation, or chemicals. Necrosis cannot be reversed. When large areas of tissue die due to a lack of blood supply, the condition is called gangrene. Option B -  A type of cell death in which a series of molecular steps in a cell lead to its death. This is one method the body uses to get rid of unneeded or abnormal cells. The process of apoptosis may be blocked in cancer cells. Also called programmed cell death. Option C - Necroptosis is a kind of necrosis that triggers innate immune responses by rupturing dead cells and releasing intracellular components; it can be caused by Toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 and TLR-4 agonists, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), certain microbial infections, and T cell receptors.</p>\n<p></p>",
