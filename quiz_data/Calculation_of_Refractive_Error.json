      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Ophthalmoscope Optical principle. The principle of indirect ophthalmoscopy is to make the eye highly myopic by placing a strong convex lens in front of the patient\u2019s eye so that the emergent rays from an area of the fundus are brought to focus as a real, inverted Imag e between the lens and the observer\u2019s eye, which is then studied</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Characteristics of Image. The Image formed in indirect ophthalmoscopy is real, inverted and magnified . About 5 times magnification and 35\u00b0 or 8 disc-diameter fields of view are obtained with a +20D lens. With a stronger lens, the Image will be smaller but brighter, and the field of vision will be more.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Retinoscopy (also called skiascopy) is a technique to objectively determine the refractive error of the eye (farsighted, nearsighted, astigmatism) and the need for glasses . The test can be quick, easy, reliably accurate and requires minimal cooperation from the patient. Option C. Amblyoscope The amblyoscope (cover image) is an instrument that was designed to develop the fusion faculty of a young patient with a The Worth amblyoscope was first constructed in 1895 by Mr Hawes of AW Hawes , Opticians in Leadenhall Street, London. It consists of two halves joined together in the middle by a hinge. Option D. Synoptophore - Synoptophore (Major Amblyoscope) \u2013 Equipment that can be used to assess the angle of deviation and binocular potential at a theoretical distance fixation.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The advantages of the binocular indirect ophthalmoscope are : Visualization through hazy media is possible due to the strong inbuilt illumination system. Field of view is much larger than direct ophthalmoscopy . Examination of peripheral retina up to ora serrata is possible Depth perception of the lesion is possible due to stereopsis with a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope. Visualization of the fundus in very high refractive error is also possible, where it may not be possible to focus the lesion with a direct ophthalmoscope.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>OCT Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a diagnostic tool that can perform cross-sectional or tomographic Images of biological tissues within less than 10 mm axial resolution using light waves. The operation of OCT is analogous to USG B-mode imaging or radar, except that light is used rather than acoustic or radio waves. OCT is especially suited for diagnostic applications in ophthalmology because of the ease of optical access to the anterior and posterior segments of the eye. The information provided by OCT is akin to in-vivo histopathology of the structure.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Types of OCT machines are : Time domain OCT (TD-OCT). Frequency domain OCT (FD-OCT). Specially encoded frequency domain OCT (SEFD-OCT). Time-encoded frequency domain OCT (TEFD-OCT). Normal OCT scan of the retina shows a cross-sectional study of the macula and optic nerve head (ONH) region, including the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) of the peripapillary region.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. FFA This test involves injecting dye into the bloodstream and taking a picture of it as it runs through the eyes. It allows careful study of the retinal circulation. In most imaging techniques, the dye appears white against a darker background. Option C - B scan B-scan ultrasonography (USG) is a simple, noninvasive tool for diagnosing lesions of the posterior segment of the eyeball. This modality can accurately evaluate common conditions such as cataracts, vitreous degeneration, retinal detachment, ocular trauma, choroidal melanoma, and retinoblastoma. Option D. ERG Electroretinography is a test to measure the electrical response of the eye's light-sensitive cells, called rods and cones. These cells are part of the retina (the back part of the eye).</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Clinical applications of OCT Applications of anterior segment OCT Imaging of the anterior chamber angle, Pachymetry, Imaging of trabeculectomy blebs, Assessment of tumours and cysts of iris and ciliary body. Applications of posterior segment OCT 1. Macular disorders . OCT is beneficial in confirming macular pathologies such as macular hole cystoid macular oedema, age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), central serous retinopathy (CSR) and the epiretinal membrane (ERM), etc. 2. Glaucoma diagnosis. An optic disc scan is very useful in diagnosing and monitoring the glaucomatous changes. It is also helpful in evaluating the RNFL for early (pre-perimetric) glaucoma detection.</p>\n<p></p>",
