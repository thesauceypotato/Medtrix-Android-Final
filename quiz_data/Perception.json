      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Functional hallucination In functional hallucinations, an external stimulus provokes a hallucination, and both hallucination and stimulus are in the same modality but individually perceived, for example, voices are heard simultaneously whenever the noise of water running through a kitchen tap is heard. They are not illusions , as the stimulus is perceived appropriately (noise of water), but in addition, there is another perception (voices) without an appropriate object.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A. If hallucinations in one modality are provoked reflexively by a stimulus in another modality , for example seeing an angel whenever listening to music, then this is called reflex hallucination . Option: B. The phenomenon of perceiving a stimulus of one modality in a different modality (may be single or multiple modalities) is called synesthesia , for example tasting the music, hearing colors, and smelling voices. Option: D. Extracampine hallucinations are experienced o utside the limits of the sensory field (outside the visual field or beyond the range of audibility). Eg. \u201cI know that there is someone behind me on the right all the time; he moves when I move\u2019, \u2018I keep on hearing them talking about my disease down in the post office\u2019 (half a mile away).</p>\n<p></p>",
