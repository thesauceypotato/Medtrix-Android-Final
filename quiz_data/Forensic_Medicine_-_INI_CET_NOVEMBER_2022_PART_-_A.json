An iron collar around the neck was tightened by a screw for strangling (Spanish Windlash). Garrotting was used by thugs around 1862 in India. A rope or a loincloth is suddenly thrown over the head and quickly tightened around the neck.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Bansdola- is a form of strangulation practised in north India. Strong bamboo is placed across the throat and another across the back of the neck . Option B. Mugging- When strangulation is brought about by compressing the throat with a foot, knee, bend of elbow, or some other solid substances, it is known as mugging (stranglehold). Option D. Strangulation- is defined as the compression of the neck by a force other than hanging . Weight of the body has nothing to do with strangulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Mechanical Asphyxia: Asphyxia : absence of pulse (literal meaning) . Exclusion of air from the lungs. Hypoxia : Deprivation of adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level, which is produced by asphyxia. Anoxia : Complete deprivation of oxygen at tissue level. Classification of violent asphyxial deaths: Hanging Complete hanging- no part of the body touching the ground. Partial /incomplete hanging- some part of the body touching the ground. Typical- knot at back of neck Atypical- knot anywhere other than back. Strangulation Ligature strangulation Throttling Bansdola Garrotting Mugging Suffocation Smothering Gagging Choking Crush asphyxia/ traumatic asphyxia Bansdola Burking Drowning Typical drowning (wet) Salt water Fresh water Atypical drowning Dry drowning - sustained laryngeal spasm Hydrocution- sudden cardiac arrest on entering water.

The offence comes under res ipsa loquitur .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Res ipsa loquitur- In doctrine of Res ipsa loquitur , the facts of the case are sufficient to justify the conclusion that doctor was negligent and negligence of doctor is responsible for the harm suffered by the patient. Examples of Res ipsa loquitur are as follows: 1. Amputation of wrong digit or limb Leaving a swab or instrument in the abdomen of the patient after operation. Giving medicine carelessly or prescribing overdose of medicines produces ill effects. \"Res ipsa loquitur\" means \"the thing or fact speaks for itself.\" The negligent act is so obvious that the patient need not prove the negligence .

Novus actus interveniens -It means an unrelated action intervening At times, it occurred that patients might suffer damage or harm due to new action , which intervene or intercede the For example \u2013 suppose an operated patient is shifted to a recovery room and suddenly, due to an earthquake , the ceiling falls over the patient and the patient dies in the accident. Here the falling of the ceiling is a new intervention that has occurred. A doctor may not be held responsible if damage occurred to a patient due to new action, which intervenes in the treatment. Option C. Res judicata -If a question of negligence against a doctor has already been decided in court , the patient will not be allowed to contest the same in another court based Multiple appeals cannot be made.
