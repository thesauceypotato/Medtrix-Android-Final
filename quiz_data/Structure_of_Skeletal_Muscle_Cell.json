      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Length When a skeletal muscle with an intact nerve supply is stretched, it contracts. This response is called the stretch reflex or myotatic reflex. The stimulus that initiates this reflex is the stretch of the muscle, and the response is  the contraction of the muscle being stretched. The sense organ is a small encapsulated spindle-like or a fusiform-shaped structure called the muscle spindle, located within the fleshy part of the muscle . The impulses originating from the spindle are transmitted to the CNS by fast sensory fibers that pass directly to the motor neurons that supply the same muscle. The neurotransmitter at the central synapse is glutamate. This sense organ is involved in signaling changes in the length of the muscle in which it is located. Changes in muscle length are associated with changes in joint angle; thus, muscle spindles provide information on position (i.e., proprioception).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The muscle jerks are used by neurologists to assess the degree of facilitation of spinal cord centers. When large numbers of facilitatory impulses are being transmitted from the upper regions of the central nervous system into the cord, the muscle jerks are greatly exaggerated. Conversely, if the facilitatory impulses are depressed or abrogated, the muscle jerks are considerably weakened or absent. These reflexes are used most frequently in determining the presence or absence of muscle spasticity caused by lesions in the motor areas of the brain or diseases that excite the bulboreticular facilitatory area of the brain stem. Ordinarily, large lesions in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex but not in the lower motor control areas (especially lesions caused by strokes or brain tumors) cause greatly exaggerated muscle jerks in the muscles on the opposite side of the body.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option B. Stretch, is closely related to option A and may seem like a plausible answer, but the correct answer is A, length, as stretch refers to the physical act of stretching, while length refers to the measurement of the distance of the muscle . Option C. Touch, and Option D, temperature, are not related to the stretch reflex or the receptor involved in regulating it. Touch receptors detect tactile stimuli , while temperature receptors detect changes in temperature .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In a neurologic examination, Deep tendon reflexes are graded on the following scale: (0): absent (1+): hypoactive (2+): brisk, normal (3+): hyperactive without clonus (4+): hyperactive with mild clonus (5+): hyperactive with sustained clonus Root values of common reflexes Biceps: C5, C6 spinal nerve Triceps: C7 spinal nerve Knee jerk: L4 spinal nerve Ankle jerk: S1 spinal nerve</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Decreasing the interval between contractions When the interval between skeletal muscle contractions is small, the force produced by the two successive contractions will summate.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The shorter the interval between the contractions, the greater the summation will be. Maximum summation is called tetanus. Summation of contractions: The muscle fiber is electrically refractory only during the rising phase and part of the falling phase of the spike potential. At this time, the contraction initiated by the first stimulus is just beginning. However, because the contractile mechanism does not have a refractory period, repeated stimulation before relaxation has occurred produces additional activation of the contractile elements and a response that is added to the contraction already present. This phenomenon is known as the summation of contractions. The tension developed during summation is considerably greater than that during the single muscle twitch. With rapidly repeated stimulation, activation of the contractile mechanism occurs repeatedly before any relaxation has occurred, and the individual responses fuse into one continuous contraction. Such a response is called tetanus (tetanic contraction). It is complete tetanus when no relaxation occurs between stimuli and incomplete tetanus when periods of incomplete relaxation take place between the summated stimuli. During complete tetanus, the tension developed is about four times that developed by the individual twitch contractions.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. Increasing extracellular Mg2+: Increasing the Mg2+ concentration will decrease skeletal muscle excitability. Option B. Decreasing extracellular Ca2+: Decreasing extracellular Ca2+ will increase the excitability of skeletal muscle fibers but does not have a direct effect on contractile force. Option C. Increasing the activity of acetylcholinesterase: Increasing the activity of acetylcholinesterase enhances the hydrolysis of acetylcholine and therefore decreases the likelihood that muscle contraction will be initiated.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Increasing the preload beyond 2.2 mm decreases the overlap between thick and thin filaments and therefore decreases the force of contraction.</p>\n<p></p>",

In Becker muscular dystrophy dystrophin is present but altered or reduced in amount. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies of various types are associated with mutations of the genes coding for the sarcoglycans or other components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Due to its enormous size and structural role in the sarcomere, titin is a prominent target for mutations that give rise to muscle disease. Mutations that encode for shorter titin structures have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, while other mutations have been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Skeletal muscle-associated tibial muscular dystrophy is a genetic muscle disease of titin that is predicted to destabilize the folded state of the protein.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "question_images": [],
      "explanation_images": [],
      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Decrease active tension and increase passive tension As the sarcomere is stretched, elastic elements of the sarcomere are passively stretched, and tension increases. So the passive tension increases Active tension decreases because as the sarcomere is stretched, the actin and myosin overlap decreases and on stimulation fewer cross-bridges form, and thus less active tension is produced. So the correct option with the correct combination is C.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The active tension in the length\u2013tension curve is generated by the contractile element of the sarcomere, that is, the interaction between the myofibrils. Passive tension is the force created by elongating the connective tissue elements within the muscle-tendon unit.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- The rest of the other options are false. Both the tension that a muscle develops when stimulated to contract isometrically (the total tension) and the passive tension exerted by the unstimulated muscle vary with the length of the muscle The length of the muscle can be varied by changing the distance between its two attachments . At each length, the passive tension is measured, the muscle is then stimulated electrically, and the total tension is measured. The difference between the two values at any length is the amount of tension actually generated by the contractile process, the active tension.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The length of the muscle at which the active tension is maximal is usually called its optimal resting length. The term comes originally from experiments demonstrating that the length of many of the muscles in the body at rest is the length at which they develop maximal tension. The observed length-tension relation in skeletal muscle can be explained by the sliding filament mechanism of muscle contraction. When the muscle fiber contracts isometrically, the tension developed is proportional to the number of cross-bridges between the actin and the myosin molecules. When the muscle is stretched, the overlap between actin and myosin is reduced and the number of cross-linkages is therefore reduced. Conversely, when the muscle is appreciably shorter than the resting length, the distance the thin filaments can move is reduced. The velocity of muscle contraction varies inversely with the load on the muscle. At a given load, the velocity is maximal at the resting length and declines if the muscle is shorter or longer than this length.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Types of\n  skeletal muscle\n  fibers Muscle\n  fiber type grouping commonly occurs due to reinnervation of denervated muscle\n  fibers in peripheral nerve damage.
