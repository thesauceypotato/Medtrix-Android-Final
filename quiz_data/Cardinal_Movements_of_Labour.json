      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>In the majority rotation occurs in the pelvic floor In the majority, rotation occurs in the pelvic floor . The prerequisites of anterior internal rotation of the head are a well-flexed head , efficient uterine contraction , favourable shape at the mid-pelvic plane and tone of the levator ani muscles The level at which internal rotation occurs is variable .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Rotation in the cervix although favorable occurs less frequently . In the majority of cases, rotation occurs at the pelvic floor . Option: D. Internal rotation occurs earlier in multipara than in primipara Option: C. Rarely , it occurs as late as the crowning of the head.</p>\n<p></p>",
