B) Uterine contractility is mediated by innervations from level T7 - T8</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The incorrect statement regarding the innervation of the uterus is option B. Uterine contractility is primarily mediated by hormonal mechanisms rather than by specific spinal innervations. Hormones such as estrogen, prostaglandins, and oxytocin play a significant role in inducing uterine contractions, while progesterone helps maintain uterine relaxation.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Sensory level is from T10 to L1: The sensory innervation of the uterus is indeed from spinal levels T10 to L1. These afferent fibers enter the spinal cord via the inferior hypogastric plexus and are responsible for transmitting sensory information from the uterus.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Sensory level is from T10 to L1:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. In the 1st stage of labor, pain is due to the fibers at level of T10 - L1: During the 1st stage of labor, pain is mediated by spinal segments T10 to L1. This pain is due to the distension of the cervix and lower uterine segment, as well as the contraction of the uterus.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. In the 1st stage of labor, pain is due to the fibers at level of T10 - L1:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. In early labor, pain is usually because of the uterine contraction: In early labor, pain is usually related to uterine contractions, which stimulate nociceptors in the genital tract and can cause discomfort and pain.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. In early labor, pain is usually because of the uterine contraction:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Uterine contractility is not mediated by innervations from spinal level T7 - T8; instead, it is primarily influenced by hormonal mechanisms.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Page 500, DC Dutta\u2019s Textbook of Obstetrics, 8 th edition</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Page 500, DC Dutta\u2019s Textbook of Obstetrics, 8 th edition</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

C) Fibrinogen</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Pregnancy is characterized as a hypercoagulable state, and several changes occur in the coagulation system during pregnancy. One of the significant changes is the increase in fibrinogen levels, which leads to a rise in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).</li><li>\u2022 Key Points:</li><li>\u2022 Key Points:</li><li>\u2022 Fibrinogen Levels: During pregnancy, fibrinogen levels increase by approximately 50%, from 200-400 mg/dL to 300-600 mg/dL. This rise in fibrinogen contributes significantly to the increased ESR. ESR: The ESR can increase up to four times during pregnancy due to the increased levels of fibrinogen and globulin. Platelet Count: There may be a slight fall in platelet count during pregnancy, commonly due to gestational thrombocytopenia, which is caused by hemodilution and increased platelet consumption. This condition usually has no adverse effect on pregnancy and is often observed in the third trimester. Coagulation Factors: There is an increase in the plasma levels of several coagulation factors, including factors 1 (fibrinogen), 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Factors 2, 5, and 12 remain unchanged or mildly increased, while factors 11 and 13 are slightly decreased. Clotting Time: Clotting time is generally unaffected by pregnancy. Anti-Thrombin III: Levels of anti-thrombin III decrease during pregnancy.</li><li>\u2022 Fibrinogen Levels: During pregnancy, fibrinogen levels increase by approximately 50%, from 200-400 mg/dL to 300-600 mg/dL.

History of Classical Cesarean Section: Classical C-sections involve a vertical incision in the uterus, increasing the risk of uterine rupture. History of 2 or more Lower Segment Cesarean Sections (LSCS): Multiple C-sections also increase the risk of uterine rupture. Malpresentation: Includes breech, transverse, or any non-cephalic presentation of the fetus. Obstructed labor: Labor that does not progress due to physical obstruction. Fetal distress: Signs that the fetus is not well, such as abnormal heart rate patterns.

This is done to quickly restore the uterus to its normal position and reduce the risk of continued bleeding and shock.</li><li>\u2022 After manually repositioning the uterus, the healthcare provider should maintain the position by keeping a fist inside the uterus and administering uterotonic agents such as oxytocin to promote uterine contractions, which help to keep the uterus in place and reduce bleeding.

In cases of trichomoniasis, it is essential to treat both the infected individual and their sexual partner(s) to prevent reinfection and to control the spread of the infection.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Bacterial vaginosis (BV): Although BV is associated with an increased risk of acquiring STIs, it is not classified as an STI itself. Therefore, routine treatment of sexual partners is not recommended.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Bacterial vaginosis (BV):</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Candidiasis : This is typically caused by an overgrowth of Candida species, commonly Candida albicans, and is not considered an STI. Treating the sexual partner is not usually necessary unless the partner has symptoms of candidiasis.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Candidiasis</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
