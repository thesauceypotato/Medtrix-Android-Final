      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Supracondylar line of humerus A fracture of the humerus just proximal to the epicondyles is called a supracondylar fracture . This is the most common cause of a Volkmann ischemic fracture. The sharp bony fragment often lacerates the brachial artery , with bleeding into the flexor compartment. Decreased arterial supply to the compartment results in ischemia. Bleeding into the compartment causes greatly increased pressure, first blocking venous outflow from the compartment, then reducing the arterial flow into the compartment. The ischemic muscles undergo contracture. A humeral fracture is sometimes placed in a cast from shoulder to wrist, often concealing the ischemia until major tissue loss occurs.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Surgical neck of humerus Fracture of the surgical neck endangers the axillary nerve and posterior humeral circumflex artery, although not ischemic contracture. Option: B .

Olecranon Fracture of the olecranon does not result in Volkmann\u2019s contracture, although the triceps brachii can displace the distal fracture fragment of the ulna .</p>\n<p></p>",

Roof formed by skin and superficial fascia. Boundaries of Anatomical Snuff Box Clinical significance of anatomical snuff box: The pulsations of radial artery can be felt in the anatomical box. The tenderness in the anatomical box indicates a fracture of the scaphoid bone. The cephalic vein at this site is often used for giving intravenous fluids. The superficial branches of the radial nerve can be rolled over the tendon of the extensor pollicis longus.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Ulnar claw Hand of benediction Nerve involved Lesion of ulnar nerve at the wrist Lesion of the median nerve at the elbow or at the wrist Typical presentation Appears in long standing cases Appears when patient attempts to make a fist Digits affected Little and ring Middle and index Muscles paralysed \u2022 Medial two lumbricals \u2022 Lateral two lumbricals \u2022 Lateral half of the FDP Movements involved Unopposed extension t the MCP joints Unopposed flexion at the IP joints Inability to flex at the MCP and IP joints of the middle and index fingers Voluntary flexion at the MCP and IP joints of the ring and little fingers</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Boutonniere deformity Boutonni\u00e8re (button-hole) deformity : It is opposite to mallet finger deformity. It is characterized by flexion of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint and hyperextension of the distal phalanx. It occurs when the flexed PIP joint pokes through the extensor expansion following the rupture of its central portion of dorsal digital expansion.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Ulnar claw Hand of benediction Nerve involved Lesion of ulnar nerve at the wrist Lesion of the median nerve at the elbow or at the wrist Typical presentation Appears in long standing cases Appears when patient attempts to make a fist Digits affected Little and ring Middle and index Muscles paralysed \u2022 Medial two lumbricals \u2022 Lateral two lumbricals \u2022 Lateral half of the FDP Movements involved Unopposed extension t the MCP joints Unopposed flexion at the IP joints Inability to flex at the MCP and IP joints of the middle and index fingers Voluntary flexion at the MCP and IP joints of the ring and little fingers</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Mallet Finger Mallet's finger is an injury to the tendons that straightens the end joint of a finger or thumb. Although it is also known as \"baseball finger,\" this injury can happen to anyone when an object like a ball strikes the tip of a finger or thumb and forces it to bend. As a result, you are not able to straighten the tip of your finger or thumb on your own. Option: B. Swan neck deformity Swan neck deformity is characterized by proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint hyperextension and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint flexion . There is also reciprocal flexion noted of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. This is a result of an imbalance of the extensor mechanism of the digit. Option: D. Jersey finger deformity Jersey finger (also known as rugby finger) is an avulsion of the flexor digitorium profundus tendon (FDP) from its distal insertion on the distal phalanx</p>\n<p></p>",
