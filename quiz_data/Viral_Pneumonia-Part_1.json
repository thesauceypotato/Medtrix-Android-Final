      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Coxsackie HFMD -Hand foot and mouth disease, caused by coxsackieviruses , usually causes fever, malaise, skin rash, sore throat, and small blisters that ulcerate. The most frequent locations for the blisters/ulcers are on the palms of the hand, soles of the feet, and in the mouth. Coxsackieviruses are part of the enterovirus family of viruses (which also includes polioviruses and hepatitis A virus).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Poxviruses are brick or oval-shaped viruses with large double-stranded DNA genomes. Poxviruses exist throughout the world and cause disease in humans and many other types of animals. Poxvirus infections typically result in the formation of lesions, skin nodules, or disseminated rash. Option C. Varicella (chickenpox) is an acute infectious disease. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which is a DNA virus that is a member of the herpesvirus group. After the primary infection, VZV stays in the body (in the sensory nerve ganglia) as a latent infection. Primary infection with VZV causes varicella. Option D. The herpes simplex virus, also known as HSV, is a viral infection that causes genital and oral herpes. Many people live with asymptomatic HSV. Options D , B and C. These are not the correct options.</p>\n<p></p>",
