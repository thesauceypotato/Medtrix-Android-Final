This concept of cooling to slow metabolism is also the rationale behind using hypothermia to decrease ischemia during cardiac, transplant, pediatric, and neurologic surgery. The cold patient is always more coagulopathic than indicated by the coagulation profile. Types of Heat Transfer: Convection is a highly inefficient way to transfer heat as the air molecules are so far apart from liquids and solids. Conduction and radiation are the most efficient ways to transfer heat. However, heating the patient with radiation is fraught with inconsistencies and technical challenges. Thus it is difficult to apply clinically, so we are left with conduction to transfer energy efficiently.</p>\n<p></p>",

During the resuscitative phase, the lethal triad (acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy) is frequent in severely bleeding patients, most likely because of two major factors. First, decreased perfusion causes lactic acidosis and consumptive coagulopathy. Second, room temperature and a large volume of fluids worsen hypothermia and dilutional coagulopathy, creating a resuscitation injury. The acidotic state is not necessarily undesirable because the body tolerates acidosis better than alkalosis. Hypothermia : Hypothermia can be both beneficial and detrimental. Fundamental knowledge of hypothermia is of vital importance in the care of surgical patients. The beneficial aspects of hypothermia are mainly a result of decreased metabolism. Injury sites are often iced, creating vasoconstriction and decreasing inflammation through decreased metabolism. This concept of cooling to slow metabolism is also the rationale behind using hypothermia to decrease ischemia during cardiac, transplant, pediatric, and neurologic surgery Coagulopathy : Always Multifactorial Causes: Acidosis Hypothermia Decreased clotting factors Consumption (from the innate attempt to stop bleeding) Dilution (from infused fluids devoid of clotting factors) Genetic (haemophilia) Tests available: Prothrombin time Partial thromboplastin time International normalised ratio Thromboelastography (TEG) Rotational Thromboelastometry</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B & C: Hypothermia and Acidosis are part of the lethal triad</p>\n<p></p>",

With insufficient delivery of oxygen and glucose, cells switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. If perfusion is not restored in a timely fashion, cell death ensues . Classification of Shock : Hemorrhagic/hypovolemic shock (due to reduced circulating volume) Causes: Non-Haemorrhagic: Poor fluid intake (dehydration), Excessive fluid loss due to vomiting, Diarrhea, urinary loss (e.g. diabetes), Evaporation or \u2018third spacing\u2019, where fluid is lost into the gastrointestinal tract and interstitial spaces, as for example in a bowel obstruction or pancreatitis. Haemorrhagic Cardiogenic shock (primary failure of the heart to pump blood to the tissues) Causes: Myocardial infarction Cardiac dysrhythmias Valvular heart disease Blunt myocardial injury Cardiomyopathy Myocardial depression caused by endogenous factors (e.g. bacterial and humoral agents released in sepsis) or exogenous factors, such as pharmaceutical agents or drug abuse Obstructive shock (reduction in preload owing to mechanical obstruction of cardiac filling) Causes: Cardiac tamponade Tension pneumothorax, Massive pulmonary embolus or air embolism In each case, there is reduced filling of the left and/or right sides of the heart, leading to low cardiac output. Distributive shock Causes: Pericardial tamponade Pulmonary embolus Tension pneumothorax IVC obstruction Deep venous thrombosis Gravid uterus on IVC Neoplasm Increased intrathoracic pressure Excess positive end-expiratory pressure Neoplasm Endocrine shock (Combination of hypovolaemic, cardiogenic or distributive shock) Causes Hypo\u00ad and hyperthyroidism Hypothyroidism causes a shocking state similar to that of neurogenic shock due to disordered vascular and cardiac responsiveness to circulating catecholamines. Cardiac output falls as a result of low inotropy and bradycardia. There may also be associated cardiomyopathy. Thyrotoxicosis may cause a high output cardiac failure Adrenal insufficiency Shock due to hypovolemia and a poor response to circulating and exogenous catecholamines. Adrenal insufficiency may be due to preexisting Addison\u2019s disease or relative insufficiency due to a pathological disease state, such as systemic sepsis.</p>\n<p></p>",
