The single cover test is a test used to determine if there is a heterotopia or tropia, which is a manifest strabismus or misalignment that is always present. The first eye is covered for approximately 1-2 seconds. As this eye is covered, the uncovered eye is observed for any shift in fixation.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>-2D Sph - 1Dcyl at 90 Let\u2019s convert into retino scopic findings: - Combination of concave cylinder with plano sphere indicates myopia in one axis and normal neutralisation in other, the indicator of simple myopic astigmatism. Refractive types of regular astigmatism: Depending upon the position of the two focal lines in relation to retina, the regular astigmatism is further classified into three types: Simple astigmatism:- wherein the rays are focused on the retina in one meridian and either in front (simple myopic astigmatism) or behind (simple hypermetropic astigmatism) the retina in the other meridian. Compound astigmatism: In this type, the rays of light in both the meridian are focused either in front or behind the retina and the condition is labelled as compound myopia or compound hypermetropic astigmatism, respectively. Mixed astigmatism:- refers to a condition wherein the light rays in one meridian are focused in front and in another meridian behind the retina. Thus in one meridian eye is myopic and in another hypermetropic. Such patients have comparatively less symptoms as 'circle of least diffusion' is formed on the retina Treatment: Optical treatment of regular astigmatism comprises the pre- scribing appropriate cylindrical lens, discovered after accurate refraction. Spectacles with full correction of cylindrical power and appropriate axis should be used for distance and near vision. Contact lenses: Rigid contact lenses may correct upto 2-3 of regular astigmatism, while soft contact lenses can correct only little astigmatism. For higher degrees of astigmatism toric contact lenses are needed. In order to maintain the correct axis of toric lenses, ballasting or truncation is required. Surgical correction of astigmatism is quite effective.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>WTR-With The Rule Astigmatism Vertical meridian of cornea is more curved Myopic power is more in vertical meridian Eg:- -3.0D cyl x 180\u00b0 ATR- Against The Rule Astigmatism Horizontal meridian of cornea is more curved Myopic power is more in horizontal meridian Eg: -3.0D cyl x 90\u00b0</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>ETIOLOGY Irregular curvature or RI in the anterior surface of cornea Irregular curvature or RI and also the position of lens/IOL The refracting power is not uniform in all meridians of both lens or cornea The principal meridians are the meridians of greatest and least refracting powers</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Astigmatism Year Plan <2.00D <2 Years Monitor 6 months >2.00D <2 Years Partial Rx >2.00D >2 Years Full Rx 1.00 to 2.00D >2 Years Rx if increasing 1.00 to 2.00D >3 Years Rx based on acuity <1.00D adult Full Rx >1.00D adult Partial Rx, then full Rx</p>\n<p></p>",
