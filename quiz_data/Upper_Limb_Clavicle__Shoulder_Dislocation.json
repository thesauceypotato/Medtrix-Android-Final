Kocher's method - The elbow is bent to 90 degrees and held close to the body; no traction should be applied. The arm is slowly rotated 75 degrees laterally, then the point of the elbow is lifted forwards, and \ufb01nally the arm is rotated medially.( Traction - External rotation-adduction-Medial rotation) This technique carries the risk of nerve, vessel and bone injury and is not recommended. Option: B. Stimson's techniQue - The patient is left prone with the arm hanging over the side of the bed. After 15 or 20 minutes the shoulder may reduce. Option: D. Hippocratic method - The Hippocratic method is performed with the patient lying in the supine position. The practitioner holds the affected limb by the forearm and hand of the patient. The practitioner then places his heel in the axilla of the patient, acting as a fulcrum while the arm of the patient is adducted. This initiates the reduction.</p>\n<p></p>",
