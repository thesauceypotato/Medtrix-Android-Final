      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. D) 3-5x magnification is provided</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Indirect ophthalmoscopy is a technique used to examine the fundus of the eye from a distance, typically at arm's length. It provides a stereoscopic (three-dimensional) view of the retina with a wide field of view, allowing visualization up to the ora serrata (peripheral retina). One of its key characteristics is the lower magnification compared to direct ophthalmoscopy.</li><li>\u2022 Indirect ophthalmoscopy provides approximately 3-5x magnification of the fundus. This lower magnification is a trade-off for the wider field of view that it offers. The 20 diopter lens is most commonly used for indirect ophthalmoscopy, and the examination is typically performed with the patient in a lying position.</li><li>\u2022 The indirect ophthalmoscope consists of a head-mounted light source and a handheld condensing lens (usually 20D). This setup creates an inverted and reverted real image between the observer and the condensing lens, providing binocular vision and excellent stereopsis, which helps in detecting elevations and depressions in the retina.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Erect and real image is formed : Incorrect. In indirect ophthalmoscopy, an inverted and real image is formed. This is in contrast to direct ophthalmoscopy, which produces an erect and virtual image. The inverted nature of the image in indirect ophthalmoscopy requires the examiner to mentally reorient the image for proper interpretation.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Erect and real image is formed</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Need to keep condenser close to patient's eye : Incorrect. In indirect ophthalmoscopy, the examiner stays at a distance (around arm's length) from the patient, and the condensing lens is held approximately 1-2 inches in front of the patient's eye. This is in contrast to direct ophthalmoscopy, where the examiner needs to be close to the patient's eye (approximately 2-3 cm).</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Need to keep condenser close to patient's eye</li><li>\u2022 Option C. 15x magnification is provided : Incorrect. Direct ophthalmoscopy provides approximately 15x magnification, not indirect ophthalmoscopy. The higher magnification in direct ophthalmoscopy allows for detailed examination of small structures but limits the field of view compared to indirect ophthalmoscopy.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. 15x magnification is provided</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Indirect ophthalmoscopy provides a wide field of view with lower magnification (3-5x) compared to direct ophthalmoscopy, forming an inverted and real image that allows examination of the peripheral retina up to the ora serrata with good stereopsis.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Fluid deficit can be estimated by manual calculation or by use of an automated fluid management system. When using hypotonic solutions (like glycine), the maximum allowed fluid deficit is 1000mL for healthy patients and 750mL for elderly patients or those with medical comorbidities. For normal saline, the maximum allowed fluid deficit is 2,500mL for healthy patients and 750mL for those with cardiovascular disease. If excessive absorption of fluid occurs with a hypotonic fluid; obtain serum electrolytes and the patient should be evaluated for volume overload. Asymptomatic hyponatremia can be treated with fluid restriction and careful monitoring of urine output. Treatment of symptomatic hyponatremia requires infusion of 3% sodium chloride and managed in intensive care.
