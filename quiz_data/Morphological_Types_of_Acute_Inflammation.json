      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Fibrinous inflammation, rheumatic carditis A fibrinous exudate develops when the vascular leaks are large, or there is a local procoagulant stimulus . Histologically, fibrin appears as an eosinophilic meshwork of thread s or sometimes as an amorphous coagulum. Fibrinous exudates may be dissolved by fibrinolysis and cleared by macrophages. If the fibrin is not removed over time, it may stimulate the ingrowth of fibroblasts and blood vessels and thus lead to scarring . Conversion of the fibrinous exudate to scar tissue (organisation) within the pericardial sac leads to opaque, fibrous thickening of the pericardium and epicardium in the area of exudation and, if the fibrosis is extensive, obliteration of the pericardial space. Bread and butter pericarditis is seen in Rheumatic carditis .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The morphologic hallmarks of acute inflammatory reactions are the dilation of small blood vessels and the accumulation of leukocytes and fluid in the extravascular tissue .
