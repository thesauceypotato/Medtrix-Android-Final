      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. C) Shin splint</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Lisfranc fracture. A Lisfranc dislocation is a spectrum of injuries involving the tarsometatarsal joints of the foot. The Lisfranc joint is composed of the articulation between the first, second, and third metatarsals bones, and the cuneiform bones. Injury of the joint can range from complete tarsometatarsal displacement with associated fractures and ligamentous tears to partial sprains with no displacement. Lisfranc injuries are uncommon and are often misdiagnosed. Even when recognized and treated promptly, there is still a high risk for chronic disability and complications. There are two main mechanisms of injury: direct, and indirect. A direct mechanism occurs as a crush injury to the joint from motor vehicle collision or industrial accident. An indirect injury is more common and is often associated with sports participation involving a longitudinal force with the foot in plantarflexion with a medial or lateral rotational force. The patient presents with complaint of midfoot pain with weight-bearing, following an acute injury. The pain worsens by forefoot weight bearing, and the patient may describe pain or difficulty with the push-off phases of walking and/or running. There is pain with abduction and eversion of the forefoot. Pain can also commonly be reproduced with passive pronation or supination of the tarsometatarsal joint. Radiographic findings show misalignment of the lateral margin of the first metatarsal base with the lateral edge of the medial cuneiform, misalignment of the medial aspect of the second metatarsal base with the medial edge of the middle cuneiform, and/or small avulsion fragments a one of metatarsal or cuneiform bones. On oblique view, the medial aspect of the cuboid should line up with the medial aspect of the fourth metatarsal base. The dorsal cortex of the first metatarsal and medial cuneiform should be aligned on the lateral radiographs. Lisfranc injuries can be managed operatively. Initial treatment includes reduction, splinting, and elevation. After six weeks, if the patient is non-tender and radiographs are negative, then begin weight-bearing and rehabilitation. If there is any tenderness but no displacement, then the patient should be in a boot or cast for at least another four weeks before starting rehabilitation. Any displacement requires surgical fixation.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Lisfranc fracture.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Jones fracture. A Jones fracture is a fracture of the proximal metadiaphyseal junction of the fifth metatarsal bone that involves the 4 th -5 th metatarsal articulation. The fracture occurs as a result of significant adduction force to the forefoot with the ankle in plantar flexion. On a plain radiograph, Jones fracture is located at the metadiaphyseal junction, approximately 2 cm (1.5-3 cm) from the tip of the 5 th metatarsal and has a predominantly horizontal course. It should not extend distally. Jones fractures are particularly prone to non-union due to being in a vascular watershed zone and take longer than two months to heal. Displacement of the fracture can increase with persistent weight-bearing; therefore, immobilization is important, with a non-weight bearing cast for 6-8 weeks. Indications for non-operative management include undisplaced fractures and fractures in patients with limited activity (i.e. recreational athletes). Operative management is indicated in patients that are elite or competitive athletes or when delayed union has occurred. Management includes either intramedullary screw fixation or open reduction and internal fixation.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Jones fracture.</li><li>\u2022 Jones fracture</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Nutcracker fracture. A nutcracker fracture refers to a cuboid bone fracture with associated navicular avulsion fracture due to compression between the bases of 4 th and 5 th metatarsals and calcaneus bone. The injury usually occurs secondary to the traumatic abduction of the forefoot. This results in loss of the normal lateral column support and excess valgus force upon the medial column that commonly causes rupture of tibialis posterior tendon or avulsion fracture of its attachment onto medial aspect of the tarsal navicular bone. Nutcracker fractures are clinically significant because they can interfere with the medchanical alignment of the foot.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
