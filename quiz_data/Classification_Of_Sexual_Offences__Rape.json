The Court decides the question of his potency from the evidence in the case. Even old men save raped young girls.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Age of the Victim: No age is safe from rape, as children of one year or less and old women of 85 years have been raped. Children are more frequently raped than adults as they cannot offer much resistance, and also due to the false belief that venereal diseases are cured by sexual intercourse with a virgin. Option: C. Under the law, a man can only commit rape, and a woman cannot rape a man, although she may be guilty of an indecent assault upon him. Option: D. The burden of Proof: The prosecution must prove all the offence's elements. In many cases of rape, there are no signs of injury or intoxication by stupefying drugs, and the allegation of lack of consent is based on fear and fraud. According to S. 114-A I.E.A., if the victim states in her evidence before the Court that she did not consent, the Court shall presume that she did not agree in a custodial situation or when she is a victim of gang rape. The burden of proof of consent rests on the accused.</p>\n<p></p>",
