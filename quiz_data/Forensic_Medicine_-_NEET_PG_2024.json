      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Transvestic fetishism The condition described here is a combination of transvestism and fetishism.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Fetishism A fetish is an abnormal stimulus or object of sexual desire. Fetichism means the use of such objects for sexual gratification. In this, recurrent, intense sexual fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving the use of living or non-living objects occur. In this, the person experiences sexual excitement leading to orgasm from part of the body of a woman or some article belonging to her that normally has no sexual influence on the mind, e.g., underclothing, brassiere, petticoat, stocking, shoes, etc. which act as a substitute for the female love object. Sometimes, the act of stealing the articles provides adequate sexual satisfaction, though often the fetish article is stored to the satisfaction of the fetish, or touching it gives him sexual pleasure, or he may masturbate into the object. It is almost exclusively seen in males. It is harmless, but rarely it may drive the person to obtain his fetish object through violence, or other criminal acts. Transvestism or eonism: The term is derived from the name of Chevelier d\u2019 Eon Beamont, a Frenchman, who preached this. A transvestite (trans = opposite; vesta = clothing) is a person whose whole personality is dominated by the desire to be identified and thought of as a member of the opposite sex. His dress, manner, occupational interests, and associations are all designed to increase his feeling of being a woman. Sexuality with him is relatively unimportant except as it promotes his feelings of femininity. It is usually found in the males who obtain sexual pleasure by wearing a female dress. Psychologically, it may depend upon an individual's erotic attraction for the opposite sex.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Gay sexual preference It is sexual inclination towards the same sex in males. Option: C. Gender dysphoria It is defined as a \"marked incongruence between their experienced or expressed gender and the one they were assigned at birth.\" It was previously termed \"gender identity disorder.\" Option: D. Voyeurism Voyeur (the so-called Peeping Tom) is defined as one who experiences recurrent, intense, sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving the act of observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaged in sexual activity.</p>\n<p></p>",

D\u2019s: Dilatation of pupils, dryness of mouth, difficulty in speech, dysphagia, dilatation of cutaneous blood vessels, dry hot skin, drunken gait, delirium, drowsiness. A bitter taste, dryness of mouth and throat, difficulty in talking, dysphagia, burning pain in the stomach, and vomiting are first noticed. The voice becomes hoarse. The face becomes flushed, conjunctivae congested, and pupils widely dilated with loss of accommodation for near vision, developing into temporary blindness, photophobia, and diplopia. Light reflex at first is sluggish and later absent. The pollen can cause unilateral mydriasis (corn picker\u2019s pupil). Mental changes include restlessness and agitation and the patient cannot recognize relatives or friends. Urinary retention and inability to pass urine occurs. The patient becomes confused, giddy, and staggers as if drunk. The skin is dry and hot, the pulse rapid 120 to 140 per minute, full and bounding, but later becomes weak and irregular, and the respirations are increased. The temperature may be raised by 2 or 3\u00b0. Muscle tone and deep reflexes are increased, and there may be muscular spasms or convulsions. Delirium is restless and purposeless; in its earlier stages, it is indicated by excitement, talkativeness, and incoherence. The patient may be silent but usually he is noisy, tries to run away from his bed, picks at the bedclothes (carphologia), exhibits typical pill-rolling movements, tries to pull imaginary threads from the tips of his fingers, and threads imaginary needles. Hallucinations of sight and hearing and delusions occur. As intoxication advances this excitement passes off in one to two hours, and the patient passes into deep sleep or coma which may end rarely in death from respiratory paralysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Cocaine It presents with dryness in the mouth, dysphagia, feeling of well-being, and loss of depression and fatigue. The patient may be excited, restless, and talkative, but this passes into a calm, dull condition. The pulse is rapid, respirations rapid and deep, pupils dilated, headache, pallor of the skin, cyanosis, sweating, and the temperature is raised. The reflexes are exaggerated, and there may be tremors or convulsions. Occasionally, the patients may have hallucinations and become maniacal. There is often a feeling of tingling or numbness in the hands and feet and a numb feeling at the place where the drug has touched, Option: C. Cannabis Taken in small doses, the effects are very slight, which usually include euphoria, passivity, heightening of subjective experiences, and disorientation. With moderate doses, these effects are intensified by impaired immediate memory function, disturbed thought patterns, lapses of attention, and a subjective feeling of unfamiliarity. High doses produce changes in body image, depersonalization and marked sensory distortion. Option: D. Alcohol Loss of muscular coordination, staggering gait, marked mental confusion, drowsiness, exaggeration of emotions, dizziness, decreased pain response, disorientation; thickened speech. Does not cause dilation of the pupil.</p>\n<p></p>",

The reaction probably depends on the presence of prostatic secretion. Florence test The stain is extracted by 10% hydrochloric acid, and a drop is placed on a glass slide and allowed to dry. A coverslip is placed over this, and a drop of Florence solution (potassium iodide, iodine, and water) is allowed to run under the coverslip.

Florence test It gives dark-brown crystals of choline iodide with semen that appear immediately. They are rhombic or needle-shaped crystals resembling hemin. Option: C. Teichmann test This test is for blood stains. A small crystal of sodium chloride and two to three drops of glacial acetic acid are placed on a small piece of the suspected stain on a glass slide. A coverslip is applied and. the acid is evaporated by heating over a small flame. It is examined under the microscope after cooling. Faint yellowish-red to brownish-black rhombic crystals of hemin or hematin chloride arranged single or in clusters are seen if blood is present. Option: D. Takayama test This test is for blood stains. Place a small piece of suspected material on a glass slide, add 2 to 3 drops of Takayama reagent (sodium hydroxide, pyridine, glucose), and cover with a coverslip. Pink feathery crystals of haemochromogen or reduced alkaline haematin arranged in clusters, sheaves, etc., appear in one to six minutes.

Saliva, blood and tissue cells may be found on the pillow. If the orifices are closed by the hand, there may be scratches, distinct nail marks, or lacerations of the soft parts of the victim's face. The lips, gums, and tongue may show bruising or laceration. Slight bruising may be found in the mouth and nose, which should be confirmed by microscopy. The asphyxial signs and symptoms are severe, because death usually results due to slow asphyxia, and often the fatal period is three to five minutes. The head and face may show intense congestion and cyanosis with numerous petechial hemorrhages in the skin of the face and beneath the conjunctivae. Blood may ooze out from the mouth and nose. The tongue may be protruded and may have been bitten.

Choking The abrasions and contusions over the lips are suggestive of smothering. Choking is a form of asphyxia caused by an obstruction within the air passages, usually between the pharynx and bifurcation of trachea. Option: B. Throttling The abrasions and contusions over the lips are suggestive of smothering. Asphyxia produced by compression of the neck by human hands is called throttling. The bruises on the neck are produced by the tips or the pads of the fingers. Their shape may be oval or round and of the size of the digits (1.5 to 2 cm.), but continued  bleeding into the contused area usually increases the size. Option: C. Hanging The ligature mark on the neck is the most important and specific sign of death from hanging.</p>\n<p></p>",

Ovulation may occur during the first trimester of pregnancy until decidua vera comes into apposition with decidua reflexa and the decidual cavity gets obliterated. Fertilisation of newly released ovum may occur following coitus. Later, two fetuses are born either at the same time showing different stages of development, or two fully developed fetuses are born at different periods varying from one to three months. Cases where a second fully developed child was born a considerable time after the first has been explained on the assumption of twin pregnancy, in which the second child did not develop either due to diminished blood supply or some other cause. On the birth of the normally developed child, the second fetus receives proper nourishment and is born later as a mature child. Evidence is accumulating which indicates that superfoetation is not only a possibility but a reality. Its occurrence in a bipartite or double uterus is certainly possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Superfecundation It means the fertilization of two ova which have been discharged from the ovary at the same period by two separate acts of coitus committed at short intervals. The incidence of twin pregnancies is about one-and-half percent, and of these about 70% are binovular twins resulting from separate fertilization of two ova formed in the same menstrual cycle. Development of twins in utero is parallel but not equal, depending on the relative blood supplies from the separately formed placentae. Both ova do not always develop to maturity. One fetus may be aborted early or die and retained until the labor expels the other. Option: C. Supposititious child It means fictitious children. A woman may pretend pregnancy and delivery and later produce a living child as her own, or she may substitute a male child for a female child born of her, or for an abortion. This is done to obtain money or to claim property. Option: D. Posthumous child It is a child born after the death of its father, the mother being conceived by the said father.
