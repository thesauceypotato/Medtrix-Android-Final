This is the true statement.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Dysmenorrhea refers to painful menstrual cramps that occur just before or during menstruation. There are two main types of dysmenorrhea: primary dysmenorrhea and secondary dysmenorrhea. Primary Dysmenorrhea: Primary dysmenorrhea is the most common type of menstrual pain and typically starts a day or two before menstruation and lasts for 2-3 days. It usually begins a few years after a woman starts menstruating and may improve with age or after childbirth.The pain is usually crampy and is felt in the lower abdomen or pelvis. Other symptoms can include lower back pain, nausea, and sometimes diarrhea. The pain is caused by the release of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that promote uterine contractions. Higher levels of prostaglandins can lead to stronger contractions and more severe pain. Non-prescription pain relievers, like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are often effective in managing primary dysmenorrhea by reducing prostaglandin levels and easing pain. Secondary Dysmenorrhea: Secondary dysmenorrhea is pain caused by an underlying medical condition, often involving the reproductive organs. It usually starts earlier in the menstrual cycle and lasts longer than primary dysmenorrhea. Conditions that can cause secondary dysmenorrhea include: Endometriosis: A condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, causing pain, adhesions, and inflammation. Adenomyosis: A condition in which the tissue lining the uterus grows into the muscular wall of the uterus, causing heavy bleeding and pain. Fibroids: Noncancerous growths in the uterus that can cause pain and heavy bleeding. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID): An infection of the reproductive organs that can cause pain, fever, and other symptoms. Ovarian Cysts: Fluid-filled sacs on the ovaries that can cause pain when they rupture or become large. Intrauterine Device (IUD): Some women may experience increased menstrual pain with certain types of IUDs. Dysmenorrhea include uterine fibroids, adenomyosis, and most commonly, endometriosis It is more common to have heavy periods, irregular periods, those whose periods started before twelve years of age and those who have a low body weight. A pelvic exam and ultrasound in individuals who are sexually active may be useful for diagnosis. Conditions that should be ruled out include ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, interstitial cystitis and chronic pelviC PAIN Painful menstrual cramps can result from an excess of prostaglandins released from the uterus. Prostaglandins cause the uterine muscles to tighten and relax causing the menstrual cramps. This type of dysmenorrhea is called primary dysmenorrhea . Primary dysmenorrhea usually begins in the teens soon after the first period. MANAGEMENT OF DYSMENORRHOEA Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be used as first-line treatment for primary dysmenorrhea. Oral contraceptives may be effective for relieving symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Review stated that high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may reduce pain compared with sham TENS, but seems to be less effective than ibuprofen</p>\n<p></p>",
