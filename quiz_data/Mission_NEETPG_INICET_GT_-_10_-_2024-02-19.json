Right Coronary artery (RCA) : The RCA typically supplies the right ventricle, the inferior part of the left ventricle, and the AV node in the majority of people (right-dominant circulation). Inferior MIs are most commonly associated with occlusion of the RCA, especially when AV nodal conduction abnormalities like the Mobitz Type I AV block are present, as the AV node's blood supply is often from the RCA in right-dominant hearts.

Left Circumflex artery (LCx) : The LCx supplies the lateral wall of the left ventricle. While occlusion of the LCx can lead to lateral MI (evidenced by ST elevations in lateral leads I, aVL, V5, and V6), it is less commonly associated with inferior MI unless in cases where the LCx provides a significant supply to the inferior wall, which is less common and usually occurs in a left-dominant circulation.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.</li><li>\u2022 Left Circumflex artery (LCx)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The key educational point is to understand the correlation between specific coronary artery occlusions and the corresponding areas of myocardial infarction, as well as associated ECG changes. An inferior wall MI with AV nodal conduction abnormalities, such as a Mobitz Type I AV block, typically implicates the RCA, especially in a right-dominant coronary circulation. This knowledge is crucial for the accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of patients with acute myocardial infarction.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Numbness on the left cheek is likely due to injury to the infraorbital nerve, which is a branch of the maxillary nerve (V2) of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), rather than the buccal branch of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII).

The buccinator muscle is primarily responsible for flattening the cheek during chewing and is involved in actions such as sucking and blowing. It helps in keeping the food against the teeth during chewing but does not prevent the accumulation of food within the vestibule of the mouth.

He is particularly focused on assessing the visual health of the younger population to implement early interventions and improve overall community eye care. As part of his comprehensive study, he has meticulously gathered data and discovered that within the demographic under 16 years of age, which constitutes 30% of the total district population, there is a significant concern: the prevalence of blindness stands at 0.8 per 1,000 individuals. Given this scenario, Dr. Verma is now tasked with calculating the total number of individuals affected by blindness in this age group to better target his health initiatives. Which of the following numbers most accurately represents the total number of blind individuals in the under-16 age group within the district, based on Dr. Verma's findings?",

A) Inhibition of estrogen production</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 Danazol is an isoxazole derivative of 17-alpha ethinyl testosterone. It is strictly anti-gonadotropin but acts as an androgen agonist. Mode of action : The mechanism of action is complex and includes the following : Acting on the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal axis \u2192 depression of frequency of GnRH pulses \u2192 suppression of pituitary FSH and LH surge. There is, however, no change in the basal gonadotropin level while the estrogen levels are reduced. Reduces the liver synthesis of SHBG and as such, free testosterone is increased which in turn causes endometrial atrophy.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. C) Pneumomediastinum</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation for each option:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Pneumomediastinum : This is the correct diagnosis. Pneumomediastinum is the presence of air in the mediastinum, the central compartment in the thoracic cavity that contains the heart, major blood vessels, trachea, esophagus, and thymus. In this case, the sudden onset of chest pain and dyspnea following intense retching, combined with the physical examination findings of subcutaneous emphysema (air in the subcutaneous tissues of the neck and upper chest) and discomfort when swallowing, are classic signs. The chest CT showing air in the mediastinum without evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion further supports this diagnosis. Pneumomediastinum can occur due to alveolar rupture from increased intra-alveolar pressure (as might happen with violent retching), allowing air to dissect along the bronchovascular sheaths into the mediastinum.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Pneumomediastinum</li><li>\u2022 Option A . Pneumothorax : This is the presence of air in the pleural space, which can cause the lung to collapse. While the symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea could be consistent with pneumothorax, the absence of pneumothorax on the CT scan rules out this diagnosis. Pneumothorax would typically show a visible rim of air outside the lung contour.</li><li>\u2022 Option A</li><li>\u2022 Pneumothorax</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Pneumoperitoneum : This is the presence of air within the peritoneal cavity, often due to gastrointestinal perforation. While abdominal pain and signs of peritonitis would be more common in pneumoperitoneum, the patient's symptoms are primarily respiratory and related to the thoracic cavity, and the CT scan findings do not indicate air in the abdominal cavity, making this diagnosis unlikely.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.</li><li>\u2022 Pneumoperitoneum</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Consolidation : This refers to the filling of the lung alveoli with fluid, pus, blood, cells, or other substances, leading to a region of lung tissue that appears solid on imaging. Common causes include pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The patient's symptoms and CT findings do not suggest consolidation, as there is no evidence of solid areas within the lung parenchyma on the scan.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.</li><li>\u2022 Consolidation</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The key educational objective here is to understand the clinical presentation and diagnostic approach to pneumomediastinum, particularly in the context of sudden-onset chest pain and dyspnea following an episode of intense retching. It is important to recognize the significance of subcutaneous emphysema and the specific CT findings that differentiate pneumomediastinum from other causes of acute chest pain, such as pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, and consolidation.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

When they become inflamed, the pain can be referred to the back of the head, which is the occiput or the top of the head, known as the vertex. Thus, 1 matches with c (Sphenoid sinusitis). Pain over the bridge of the nose aggravated by movements of the eyeball is typically a symptom of ethmoid sinusitis. The ethmoid sinuses are located between the eyes and inflammation here can cause pain that is felt around the eyes and can be exacerbated by eye movements. Hence, 2 matches with b (Ethmoid sinusitis). Pain over the upper jaw aggravated by chewing is characteristic of maxillary sinusitis. The maxillary sinuses are located in the cheekbones, right beneath the eyes, and inflammation or infection can cause pain that is felt in the upper jaw, particularly when chewing. Therefore, 3 matches with d (Maxillary sinusitis). An office headache that starts in the morning and reduces by evening is often due to frontal sinusitis. The frontal sinuses are located above the eyes, in the forehead region. Pain and pressure from inflammation of the frontal sinuses can lead to a headache that is more pronounced in the morning and improves as the day progresses. Thus, 4 matches with a (Frontal sinusitis).</li><li>\u2022 Headache localized to occiput/vertex is often associated with sphenoid sinusitis.

D) Premenstrual dysphoric disorder</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation for each option:</li><li>\u2022 Option B: This patient's cyclical pattern of overeating, mood swings, and irritability, which worsen prior to menstruation and resolve for a few weeks at a time, is suggestive of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).PMDD, a severe variant of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), is characterized by prominent mood symptoms, including sadness, mood swings, anger, anxiety, irritability, and decreased interest, as well as fatigue, changes in appetite, and physical discomfort (eg, bloating, breast tenderness). These mood symptoms decrease in intensity or resolve completely after menstruation.</li><li>\u2022 Option B:</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Bulimia nervosa is characterized by episodes of excessive, uncontrollable eating within a specified period (e.g., 1-2 hr) that occur at least once a week for 3 months. In bulimia nervosa, this is accompanied by compensatory behaviors such as fasting, laxative abuse, or excessive exercising. Compared with patients with these eating disorders, this patient describes more cyclical pattern of overeating, together with mood lability and irritability, finding consistent with PMDD.</li><li>\u2022 Option A:</li><li>\u2022 Option B: Although irritability can be a symptom of hypomania, as seen in cyclothymic disorder, this patient does not have a history of other hypomanic symptoms (e.g., increased energy, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, grandiosity), which is required to diagnose these disorders.</li><li>\u2022 Option B:</li><li>\u2022 Option C: Mood changes in the premenstrual phase are common, requiring differentiation of PMS and PMDD from premenstrual worsening of another medical or psychiatric condition. For example, patients with persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), a chronic form of depression, may describe premenstrual exacerbation of depressive symptoms. However, careful history-taking in such a patient shows that depressive symptoms are present at other times during the menstrual cycle, unlike in this patient, who has 2 weeks of feeling good before the mood changes occur. The accurate diagnosis of PMDD requires prospective daily ratings for \u22652 cycles demonstrating a symptom-free period in the follicular phase.</li><li>\u2022 Option C:</li><li>\u2022 Educational objective:</li><li>\u2022 Educational objective:</li><li>\u2022 Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is characterized by cyclical mood swings, irritability, appetite changes, and physical discomfort that resolve after menses.

Decreased homocysteine levels : Cobalamin deficiency typically leads to elevated homocysteine levels, not decreased. Cobalamin is required for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, and its deficiency results in the accumulation of homocysteine.</li><li>\u2022 Option A.</li><li>\u2022 Decreased homocysteine levels</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Decreased level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) : LDH levels can be elevated in a variety of conditions, including hemolysis and certain malignancies, but they are not specifically indicative of cobalamin deficiency. Decreased LDH levels would not support a diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.</li><li>\u2022 Decreased level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) : This is the correct answer. Cobalamin is a cofactor for the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. In cobalamin deficiency, this conversion is impaired, leading to the accumulation of methylmalonic acid. Elevated MMA levels are specific for cobalamin deficiency and can occur even before the onset of hematologic abnormalities, making this an important diagnostic marker.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.</li><li>\u2022 Elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA)</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Negative anti-intrinsic factor antibody : The presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies can support a diagnosis of pernicious anemia, an autoimmune condition leading to cobalamin deficiency. However, a negative test does not rule out cobalamin deficiency, as there are other causes of the deficiency that do not involve intrinsic factor antibodies. Given these options, the laboratory result that best supports a diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency is Elevated methylmalonic acid .</li><li>\u2022 Option D.</li><li>\u2022 Negative anti-intrinsic factor antibody</li><li>\u2022 Elevated methylmalonic acid</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 To understand the diagnostic approach to cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency. Elevated levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA) are a specific marker for cobalamin deficiency and can be useful in diagnosing the condition, especially in patients with neurological symptoms but without overt hematologic abnormalities. Recognizing the role of MMA in the diagnostic workup of cobalamin deficiency is crucial for timely and accurate diagnosis.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Overuse of hydrochlorothiazide : Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that increases the excretion of sodium and potassium in the urine.

Hemodilution : This is the most likely cause of the patient's low serum albumin level in this context. The rapid infusion of intravenous fluids, especially in a state of dehydration due to gastrointestinal losses, can dilute the concentration of serum proteins, including albumin. Since the patient's symptoms are acute and he was previously healthy, hemodilution from fluid resuscitation is the most plausible explanation. Given the acute onset of symptoms, recent fluid resuscitation, and the absence of chronic symptoms or disease indicators, the most likely cause of this patient's low serum albumin level is Hemodilution .</li><li>\u2022 Option A.</li><li>\u2022 Hemodilution</li><li>\u2022 Hemodilution</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) : This is the most likely diagnosis. SBS, also known as abusive head trauma, is a form of inflicted head injury that occurs when an infant is violently shaken. The characteristic radiological findings in SBS include bilateral subdural hematomas, cerebral edema, and often retinal hemorrhages, as described in the scenario. The absence of external signs of trauma with these internal injuries is highly suggestive of SBS. The CT findings mentioned, particularly the bilateral subdural hematomas and cerebral edema, are common in SBS, making this the characteristic radiological finding indicative of severe head trauma in infants.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS)</li><li>\u2022 Option A . Epidural Hematoma : This is a collection of blood between the dura mater and the skull. It typically results from arterial injury and presents as a biconvex (lens-shaped) hyperdense area on CT scans. Epidural hematomas are less common in infants due to the nature of their head injuries and the anatomy of their skulls and dura. They are more often associated with skull fractures and do not usually present with the combination of symptoms seen in SBS.</li><li>\u2022 Option A</li><li>\u2022 Epidural Hematoma</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Subarachnoid Hemorrhage : This involves bleeding into the subarachnoid space, where cerebrospinal fluid circulates. It can be caused by trauma but is also seen in other conditions like aneurysm rupture. While subarachnoid hemorrhage could be present in head trauma, the specific combination of bilateral subdural hematomas, retinal hemorrhages, and cerebral edema without external trauma is more characteristic of SBS.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.</li><li>\u2022 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI) : DAI is a type of traumatic brain injury that involves widespread injury to the brain's white matter. It's typically caused by severe rotational forces or deceleration, not necessarily associated with impact injuries. While DAI can occur in severe head trauma, the CT findings of bilateral subdural hematomas and retinal hemorrhages, along with the clinical presentation, are more indicative of SBS.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.</li><li>\u2022 Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI)</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The key educational objective is to recognize the signs and radiological findings associated with Shaken Baby Syndrome, a severe form of infant head trauma. Health professionals should be alert to the combination of clinical symptoms like irritability, vomiting, poor feeding, lethargy, retinal hemorrhages, and a bulging fontanelle, along with CT findings of bilateral subdural hematomas and cerebral edema, in the absence of external trauma signs. This knowledge is crucial for the early identification and intervention in cases of suspected infant abuse to prevent further injury and to safeguard the child's well-being.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Emphysematous cholecystitis : This is the most likely diagnosis. Emphysematous cholecystitis is a severe form of acute cholecystitis characterized by gas formation in the gallbladder wall and lumen, often due to infection by gas-forming organisms. It is more common in diabetic patients and presents with severe right upper quadrant pain, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers. The presence of gas would be identifiable on an NCCT scan of the abdomen, distinguishing it from other forms of cholecystitis. The severe presentation, coupled with the patient's diabetic status, makes this diagnosis particularly likely.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Emphysematous cholecystitis</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Calculous cholecystitis : This is the inflammation of the gallbladder due to the obstruction of the cystic duct by gallstones. While the patient's symptoms of right upper quadrant pain, fever, and a positive Murphy's sign are consistent with acute cholecystitis, the presence of gas in the gallbladder wall or lumen on the NCCT scan, if mentioned, would point more specifically toward emphysematous cholecystitis rather than the more common calculous cholecystitis.</li><li>\u2022 Option A.</li><li>\u2022 Calculous cholecystitis</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Acute pancreatitis : This condition involves inflammation of the pancreas and presents with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, elevated pancreatic enzymes, and findings on imaging studies. While abdominal pain and elevated enzymes are present in this patient, the right upper quadrant pain and positive Murphy's sign are more characteristic of gallbladder pathology than pancreatitis.</li><li>\u2022 Option</li><li>\u2022 B.</li><li>\u2022 Acute pancreatitis</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Choledocholithiasis : This refers to the presence of one or more gallstones in the common bile duct. Symptoms can include right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and possibly cholangitis if there is associated infection. While the patient's liver enzyme abnormalities could suggest bile duct involvement, the clinical picture and imaging findings are more suggestive of gallbladder disease, particularly emphysematous cholecystitis, given the patient's diabetic status and severe presentation.</li><li>\u2022 Option</li><li>\u2022 C.</li><li>\u2022 Choledocholithiasis</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The key educational objective is to recognize the clinical features and diagnostic criteria for emphysematous cholecystitis, especially in diabetic patients presenting with severe right upper quadrant pain, fever, and specific findings on NCCT. It's important to distinguish this condition from other causes of abdominal pain such as calculous cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, and choledocholithiasis, using clinical assessment, laboratory investigations, and imaging studies. Emphysematous cholecystitis is a surgical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and management due to its high morbidity and mortality rates.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

It isa rare disorder that can be diagnosed only after psychosis due to substance intoxication/withdrawal or a medical condition is ruled out. This patient's onset of hallucinations 12 hours following hospitalization, along with a history of alcohol abuse, is more suggestive of alcohol withdrawal-induced psychosis (i.e., alcoholic hallucinosis).</li><li>\u2022 Option B:</li><li>\u2022 Brief psychotic disorder</li><li>\u2022 Option C: Cocaine withdrawal causes depression, anxiety, fatigue, and intense cravings.

GLUT 2: GLUT 2 is the glucose transporter specifically found in pancreatic beta cells. It plays a crucial role in sensing blood glucose levels and allowing glucose to enter beta cells, where it can trigger insulin release in response to elevated blood glucose.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

GLUT 4: GLUT 4 is another glucose transporter, but it is primarily found in muscle and fat cells. GLUT 4 translocates to the cell membrane in response to insulin signaling and facilitates glucose uptake in these tissues. It is not the transporter responsible for glucose entry into pancreatic beta cells.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. GLUT 4:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Simple diffusion: While glucose can passively diffuse into some cells, the entry of glucose into pancreatic beta cells is primarily facilitated by GLUT 2 transporters.

This combination improves neurohormonal modulation, helping to reduce disease progression. Other medications like digoxin and aliskiren have a limited role and do not confer mortality benefit, while ACE inhibitors like lisinopril are part of standard therapy but should not be combined with ARBs.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
