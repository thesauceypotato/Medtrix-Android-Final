Scleredema primarily affects the skin on the upper back and neck, sparing the hands and feet. It involves increased mucin deposition and thickened collagen fibers without fibroblast proliferation.

She noticed that the affected areas occasionally have a mild yellowish discharge, and the boy frequently scratches his head, which seems to worsen at night. The mother also reports swelling in his neck, which she assumes are \"swollen glands.\" The child has no significant past medical history but has recently been playing with a neighbor\u2019s kitten, which also seems to be losing hair. On examination, the boy has a well-demarcated, round, scaly alopecic patch on the scalp with visible broken hairs close to the scalp surface. There is mild erythema, and some pustules are visible.

This condition is common in individuals seeking attention or expressing psychological distress through physical means. The lesions are typically well-defined, unusual in shape or pattern, and located in accessible areas that the patient can easily reach, such as the face, arms, or legs. In this case, the linear pattern of lesions and the child's vague and evasive responses are classic indications of dermatitis artefacta, rather than a true allergic or infectious skin condition.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis occurs due to an allergic reaction to an external substance, such as henna.

However, the psychological pattern and non-pruritic nature seen in this case do not align with allergic contact dermatitis.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Allergic Contact Dermatitis</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Impetigo Impetigo is a bacterial skin infection that typically presents with honey-colored crusts, often around the nose and mouth.

Impetigo</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
