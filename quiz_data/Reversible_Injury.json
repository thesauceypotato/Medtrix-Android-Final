      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Reversible injury Cellular swelling is the first manifestation of almost all forms of injury to cells. It is a difficult morphologic change to appreciate with the light microscope; it may be more apparent at the level of the whole organ. When it affects many cells , it causes some pallor, increased turgor, and an increase in the weight of the organ . On microscopic examination , small clear vacuoles may be seen within the cytoplasm ; these represent distended and pinched-off segments of the ER . This pattern of nonlethal injury is sometimes called hydropic change or vacuolar degeneration . The swelling of cells is reversible. Cells may also show increased eosinophilic staining , which becomes much more pronounced with progression to necrosis . Epithelial cells of the proximal tubule showing early cell injury resulting from reperfusion following ischemia. The microvilli are lost and have been incorporated in apical cytoplasm; blebs have formed and are extruded in the lumen. Mitochondria (M) would have been swollen during ischemia; with reperfusion, they rapidly undergo condensation and become electron-dense</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The ultrastructural changes of reversible cell injury, visible by electron microscopy, include the following: Plasma membrane alterations, such as blebbing , blunting, and loss of microvilli Mitochondrial changes, including swelling and the appearance of small amorphous densities Accumulation of \u201c myelin figures \u201d in the cytosol composed of phospholipids derived from damaged cellular membranes Dilation of the ER, with the detachment of polysomes Nuclear alterations , with disaggregation of granular and fibrillar elements</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Nuclear change s appear in one of three patterns : The basophilia of the chromatin may fade Karyolysis Pyknosis is characterised by nuclear shrinkage and increased basophilia.

Generalized swelling of the cell and its organelles, blebbing of the plasma membrane. The swelling of cells results from an influx of water . Caused by failure of the ATP-dependent Na-K plasma membrane pump due to depletion of ATP, which causes Na to accumulate inside the cell, which pulls water into the cell causing swelling. Option: B. Fatty change. Fatty change occurs in organs that are actively involved in lipid metabolism (e.g., the liver) . It results when a toxic injury disrupts metabolic pathways and leads to rapid accumulation of triglyceride-filled lipid vacuoles . Option: C. Visible vacuoles in the cytoplasm. On microscopic examination, small clear vacuoles may be seen within the cytoplasm ; these represent distended and pinched-off segments of the ER . This pattern of nonlethal injury is sometimes called hydropic change or vacuolar degeneration .</p>\n<p></p>",
