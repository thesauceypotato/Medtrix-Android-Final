However, the clinical course changed later so that the patient experiences deterioration in function unassociated with acute attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>DISEASE COURSE OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS- Three clinical types of MS exist: Relapsing or bout onset Multiple sclerosis (RMS) 90% of MS cases(Most common ) characterized by discrete attacks of neurologic dysfunction generally evolve over days to weeks (rarely over hours). With initial attacks, there is often substantial or complete recovery over the ensuing weeks to months. However, as attacks continue , recovery may be less evident. Between attacks, patients were traditionally thought to be neurologically stable; However it is now clear that many patients with RMS experience subtle \u201csilent\u201d progression even when relapse-free. Secondary progressive Multiple sclerosis (SPMS) always begins as RMS. At some point, however, the clinical course changes so that the patient experiences progressive deterioration in function unassociated with acute attacks. SPMS produces a greater amount of fixed neurologic disability than RMS. For a patient with RMS, the risk of developing SPMS was approximately 3% each year in the pretreatment era, meaning that the great majority of RMS would ultimately evolve into SPMS. However, recent case series have indicated a much lower rate of evolution to SPMS, estimated at slightly >1% each year , likely due to the widespread use of effective therapies for MS. Primary progressive Multiple sclerosis (PPMS) 10% of MS cases. These patients do not experience attacks but rather a steady decline in function from disease onset. Compared to RMS, the sex distribution is more even , the disease begins later in life (mean age ~40 years) , and disability develops faster (relative to the onset of the first clinical symptom). Despite these differences, PPMS appears to represent the same underlying illness as RMS. PPMS has the worst prognosis. Progressive MS and Disease Activity Patients with SPMS or even PPMS will occasionally experience relapses, Though, less often than in RMS. Progressive MS patients experiencing relapses or who are found to have acute new lesions on MRI are considered to have \u201cactive\u201d progressive MS.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

MRI reveals multifocal asymmetric, coalescing white matter lesions located periventricular, in the centrum semiovale, in the parietal-occipital region, and in the cerebellum. These lesions have increased signal on T2 and FLAIR images and decreased signal on T1-weighted images . PML lesions are not typically associated with edema or mass effect. CT scans are less sensitive than MRI for the diagnosis of PML. Large confluent lesion in subcortical white matter and cortical gray matter Hyperintense on T2W and FLAIR; hypointense on T1W No mass effect Contrast enhancement* NATALIZUMAB - Natalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the \u03b14 subunit of \u03b14\u03b21 integrin , a cellular adhesion molecule expressed on the surface of lymphocytes. It prevents lymphocytes from binding to endothelial cells , thereby preventing lymphocytes from penetrating the BBB and entering the CNS. Natalizumab is highly effective in reducing the attack rate and significantly improves all measures of disease severity in MS (both clinical and MRI). monthly intravenous infusions. Treatment is, in general, well tolerated. A small percentage (<10%) of patients hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) ~6% develop neutralizing antibodies to the molecule (only half of which persist ). The major concern is risk for PML( Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) , occurring in ~0.4% of patients treated with natalizumab. The incidence of PML is very low in the first year of treatment but then rises in subsequent years of treatment to reach a level of about 2 cases per 1000 patients per year. Nevertheless, the measurement of antibodies against the JC virus in the serum can be used to stratify this risk. Approximately half of the adult population is JC antibody positive , indicating that they experienced an asymptomatic infection with the JC virus at some time in the past. Thus, in patients who do not have these antibodies, the risk of PML is minimal ( <1:10,000 as long as they remain JC antibody free ). Conversely, in patients who have these antibodies (especially those who have them in high titer), the risk may be as high as \u22651.1%. Up to 2% of seronegative MS patients undergoing treatment with natalizumab seroconvert annually; thus, it is recommended that JC antibody status be assessed at 6-month intervals in all patients receiving natalizumab. In antibody-positive patients , a change to another disease-modifying therapy should be strongly considered. The risk of PML is also high in patients who previously received immunosuppressive therapy. Natalizumab is generally recommended only for JC antibody-negative patients, unless they have failed alternative therapies or if they have a particularly aggressive disease course.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Ocrelizumab -It is generally well tolerated with infusion-related reactions occurring in a minority of patients; these are most often observed with the first infusion and are usually mild in degree. Option: B . Fingolimod - Mild elevated liver function tests or lymphopenia are common , sometimes requiring discontinuation of the medication. First- and second-degree heart block and bradycardia can also occur when fingolimod therapy is initiated. Option: C.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Only b is correct Correct statement- Statement b. Fatigue is experienced by 90% of patients; this symptom is the most common reason for work-related disability in Multiple Sclerosis . Fatigue can be exacerbated by elevated temperatures, depression, expending exceptional effort to accomplish basic activities of daily living, or sleep disturbances (e.g., from frequent nocturnal awakenings to urinate) Multiple sclerosis related fatigue is most appropriately treated with stimulants such as modafinil. Other statements- Statement a. Mild CSF pleocytosis (>5 cells/\u03bcL) is present in ~25% of cases, usually in young patients with RMS (Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis) , The total CSF protein is usually normal or mildly elevated and no increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Patients with Multiple Sclerosis may show Oligoclonal bands. Statement c. Ocrelizumab -a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD20 B-cells , was shown in a single phase 3 trial to reduce progression of clinical disability in Primary Progressive MS by 24%, and also to improve other clinical and MRI markers of inflammatory and degenerative disease activity , compared with placebo treatment. Ocrelizumab represents the first agent to convincingly modify the course of PPMS. Statement d.Teriflunomide - not preferred especially in women of childbearing age, due to it's possible teratogenicity (pregnancy category X ); teriflunomide can remain in the bloodstream for 2 years due to hepatobiliary reabsorption. Option A,B,D are incorrect.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Treatment of Multiple sclerosis- Acute management-Steroids Disease modifying therapy Injectable Interferon-beta Glatiramer Oral Fingolimod DMF(Dimethyl fumarate) Teriflunomide Siponimod Infusions Mitoxantrone Natalizumab Alemtuzumab Ocrelizumab-Anti CD20 antibody Symptomatic management- Fatigue Rx stimulants- Modafinil progressive leukoencephalopathy Primary progressive Ocrelizumab + Interferon-beta(Immunosuppression) Secondary progressive Interferon-beta</p>\n<p></p>",
