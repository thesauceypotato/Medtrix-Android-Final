The mother reports that her daughter has been ridiculed for her lack of secondary sexual characteristics and absence of menarche. After a thorough history and physical examination, the pediatrician orders an ultrasound, which reveals an infantile uterus and streak ovaries. Further genetic workup indicates a ring chromosome abnormality involving one of the X chromosomes. The pediatrician begins a discussion about starting hormonal therapy to induce secondary sexual characteristic development. During the consultation, the mother inquires about any associated cardiac anomalies that might be present with her daughter's condition. As a pediatrician, which cardiac anomaly would you inform the mother is most commonly associated with this condition ?",
