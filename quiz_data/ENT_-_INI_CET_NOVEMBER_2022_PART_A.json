      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1,2,6,4,3,5 Otoacoustic emissions are low-intensity sounds produced by outer hair cells of a normal cochlea and can be elicited by a very sensitive microphone placed in the external ear canal and analyzed by a computer. Sound produced by outer hair cells travels in a reverse direction: outer hair cells \u2192 basilar membrane \u2192 perilymph \u2192 oval window \u2192 ossicles \u2192 tympanic membrane \u2192 ear canal.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>OAEs are present when outer hair cells are healthy and are absent when they are damaged and thus help to test the function of cochlea. They do not disappear in VIIIth nerve pathology as cochlear hair cells are normal. Otoacoustic emissions can be used to assess the integrity of outer hair cells. Otoacoustic emissions are non-linear distortion products generated in the cochlea and transmitted back through the middle ear to the outer ear, where they can be detected as sound using a sensitive microphone</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>USES (a) OAEs are used as a screening test of hearing in neonates and to test hearing in uncooperative or mentally challenged individuals after sedation. Sedation does not interfere with OAEs. (b) They help to distinguish cochlear from retrocochlear hearing loss. OAEs are absent in cochlear lesions, e.g. ototoxic sensorineural hearing loss. They detect ototoxic effects earlier than pure tone audiometry. (c) OAEs are also useful to diagnose retrocochlear pathology, especially auditory neuropathy. Auditory neuropathy is a neurologic disorder of CN VIII. Audiometric tests, e.g. SNHL for pure tones, impaired speech discrimination score, absent or abnormal auditory brainstem response, show a retrocochlear type of lesion but OAEs are normal</p>\n<p></p>",

It is characterized by the accumulation of nonpurulent effusion in the middle ear cleft Cause : Malfunctioning (adenoid hyperplasia, chronic sinusitis or tonsillitis or rhinitis, palatal defects, tumors of nasopharynx) or increased secretory activity of the eustachian tube (allergy, unresolved otitis media, viral infections). Often seen in children 5-8 years of age. They present with hearing loss not exceeding 40 dB, which is insidious in onset. Speech may be delayed and defective due to hearing loss. On otoscopy, Dull and opaque tympanic membrane with loss of light reflex Thin leash of vessels along the handle of the malleus If the tympanic membrane is transparent, fluid levels and air bubbles can be seen. The fluid accumulation causes decreased mobility of the tympanic membrane leading to a flat or dome-shaped curve or type B curve on a tympanogram On impedance audiometry , there is reduced compliance and a flat curve shifted to the negative side due to the presence of fluid. X-ray mastoid reveals clouding of air cells . Treatment is mainly aimed at the removal of fluid and preventing recurrence. Medical management includes decongestants, antibiotics, and middle ear aeration techniques Surgical management includes myringotomy and aspiration of fluid , grommet insertion , tympanotomy, or cortical mastoidectomy. Adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy may be required to treat the cause of serous otitis media.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>PTA PTA- The purpose of PTA is to determine the hearing thresholds for pure tones , which are sinusoidal signals with a single defined frequency, amplitude and phase. It is a subjective, behavioral, measurement of a hearing threshold , as it relies on patient response to pure tone stimuli.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>USES OF PURE TONE AUDIOGRAM It is a measure of threshold of hearing by air and bone conduction and thus the degree and type of hearing loss. A record can be kept for future reference. Audiogram is essential for prescription of hearing aid. Helps to find degree of handicap for medicolegal purposes Helps to predict speech reception threshold</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A- Impedance Audiometry- The primary purpose is to determine the status of the tympanic membrane and middle ear by tympanometry. It is an objective test of hearing. OPTION B- BERA- It is an objective test of eliciting brain stem potentials in response to audiological click stimuli. OPTION C- OAE- Otoacoustic emissions are sounds produced by motile elements of cochlear outer hair cells . It is also an objective tests of hearing.</p>\n<p></p>",
