Peripheral chemoreceptors are primarily sensitive to small decreases in PaO2 and small increases in local partial pressure of CO2, while central chemoreceptors are primarily sensitive to small increases in PaCO2.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Peripheral arterial chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies are exposed to a very high rate of blood flow. These receptors are primarily activated by a reduction in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), but they also respond to an increase in the arterial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and pH. When the intracranial pressure is increased, the blood supply to the brain is compromised and Local Hypercapnia activates central chemoreceptors located along the ventrolateral medullary surface. Their activation induces a rise in systemic arterial pressure (Cushing reflex) that tends to restore the blood flow to the brain. The rise in BP causes a reflex decrease in heart rate via the arterial baroreceptors. This is why bradycardia and not tachycardia is seen in patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure: called Cushing\u2019s reflex.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Only Option C is the correct answer as it describes the response of peripheral chemoreceptors to small decreases in PaO2 and central chemoreceptors to small increases in Rest options are incorrect</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Hypoxia \u2193O, delivery to tissues.

The oxygenated blood from the placenta has a higher partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) compared to the deoxygenated blood returning to the placenta through the umbilical arteries.

Option D: The ductus venosus has only a slightly lower PO2, and serves to direct much of the highly oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava, bypassing the liver. From the right atrium, about two-thirds of the inferior vena caval flow (67% O2 saturation) is diverted across the foramen ovale to the left atrium.</p>\n<p></p>",

Also, once the sample is obtained, the syringe should be placed in a container of crushed ice to prevent any metabolism by the red blood cells, which can also affect the accuracy of the readings. In addition to being certain that an air bubble is not left in the syringe, it is best to use a glass rather than a plastic syringe because the arterial pressure will pump the blood sample into a glass syringe without requiring aspiration, and glass is more impermeable to the diffusion of gasses than plastic. A plastic syringe is permissible if one is drawing the blood sample from an arterial line rather than doing an arterial stick and if the sample is promptly analyzed.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. is incorrect because drawing room air into the syringe before measuring the blood-gas values can lead to a higher measured PaO2 value but a lower measured PaCO2 value. Option B. is incorrect because drawing room air into the syringe before measuring the blood-gas values can lead to a higher measured PaO2 value due to the extra oxygen in the room air. Option D. is incorrect because drawing room air into the syringe before measuring the blood-gas values can lead to a higher measured PaO2 value due to the extra oxygen in the room air. The correct answer is option C, as drawing room air into the syringe before measuring the blood-gas values can lead to a higher measured PaO2 value and a lower measured PaCO2 value, which is opposite to option D.</p>\n<p></p>",

Hemoglobin can exist in different states of oxygenation, depending on the presence or absence of O2 molecules. The binding of the first O2 molecule to hemoglobin induces a conformational change in the protein, making it easier for additional O2 molecules to bind to the remaining heme sites. This results in an increasing slope of the curve as more O2 molecules are bound. As the number of O2 molecules bound to hemoglobin increases, the affinity of the remaining heme sites for O2 also increases. This is because the binding of O2 stabilizes the conformational change induced by the first O2 molecule, making it easier for additional O2 molecules to bind. This results in a steeper slope of the curve at intermediate O2 saturation levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option B: (binding of one O2 molecule decreases the affinity of binding of other O2 molecules) is incorrect because it describes negative cooperativity, which results in a hyperbolic, not sigmoidal, O2 dissociation curve.

The Bohr effect describes how changes in pH affect the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. Specifically, as the pH decreases (i.e. becomes more acidic), the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen decreases.
