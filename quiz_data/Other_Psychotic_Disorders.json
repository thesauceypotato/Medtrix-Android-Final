The diagnostic criteria for Schizoaffective disorder require the presence of \u2265 2 of the following psychotic symptoms : delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, negative symptoms, and grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior. Additionally, symptoms must be present for \u2265 2 weeks , and this patient's auditory hallucinations started only a week ago. Finally, diagnostic criteria for this condition also require that criteria for a major mood disorder are met in the periods without psychotic symptoms ; this patient has not had any period without psychotic symptoms. Option: C. Adjustment disorder can occur in response to a traumatic life event and manifest with impaired social functioning and symptoms of depressed mood , both of which are seen here. However, affected individuals do not present with the auditory hallucinations seen in this patient. Moreover, adjustment disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion , and this patient's symptoms are better explained by another psychological disorder. Option: D. Acute stress disorder can manifest with insomnia and negative mood , both of which are seen here. Furthermore, the death of a relative can be traumatic and trigger an acute stress disorder. However, this condition does not manifest with hallucinations . Moreover, in acute stress disorder affected individuals also present with intrusive symptoms (e.g., recurrent distressing memories/dreams about the traumatic event, flashbacks), dissociative symptoms (e.g., loss of memory regarding details of the event), active avoidance (i.e., avoidance of external reminders, memories, thoughts, and feelings related to the event), and other symptoms related to arousal (e.g., irritable behavior, hypervigilance), none of which is seen in this patient.</p>\n<p></p>",
