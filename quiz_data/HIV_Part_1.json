      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>P24 antigen detection The \" window period \" refers to the maximum amount of time it may take for a person's body to create HIV antibodies after HIV infection. Usually, the ELISA test turns positive after 3-6 months of infection. The p24 antigen test can detect the p24 protein on average 10 to 14 days after infection with HIV . One drawback of this test is that levels of the p24 protein peak at around three to four weeks after exposure to HIV and are usually not detectable after five to six weeks (and sometimes even earlier) corresponding with the development of antip24 antibodies.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>HIGH YIELDING:- A positive p24 test means that someone is HIV-positive. However, a negative p24 test can mean three things: The person is HIV-negative The person is HIV-positive but the test could not detect the p24 protein because the person was infected more than four to six weeks earlier The levels of the p24 antigen are too low to be detectable with current technologies. The HIV NAAT test is a very sensitive test designed to detect HIV RNA in blood. The NAAT test is able to detect HIV RNA as early as 7 to 14 days after infection with HIV. Unlike the p24 test, the NAT test will always give a positive result as long as there is HIV in someone's blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options A, B, and D are not the most sensitive tests during the window period among the following.</p>\n<p></p>",

During this time, some people have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, and Rash. In the acute stage of infection , HIV multiplies rapidly and spreads throughout the body. The virus attacks and destroys the CD4 cells ( CD4 T lymphocyte ) of the immune system. A close differential is acute infectious mononucleosis Infectious mononucleosis also known as glandular fever , is an infection usually caused by the Epstein\u2013Barr virus . It can also present with fever, pharyngitis, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The most prominent sign of the disease is often pharyngitis , which is frequently accompanied by enlarged tonsils with pus \u2014an exudate similar to that seen in cases of strep throat.
