Small VSDs can even get close with age. If the VSD is large, it transmits left ventricular systolic pressure to the right ventricle. Thus, the proper ventricular pressure increases and the difference in the systolic pressure between the two ventricles reduces. The systolic left-to-right shunt becomes shorter, softer, and heard as an ejection systolic murmur.</p>\n<p></p>",
