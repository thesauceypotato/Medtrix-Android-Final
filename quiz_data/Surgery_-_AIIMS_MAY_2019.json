The most common malignant neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas is gastrinoma. The investigation of choice for Insulinoma is the determination of 72-hour fasting. Glucose and serum insulin levels. Clinical features include Hypoglycemia, including fatigue, weakness, hunger, tremor, diaphoresis & tachycardia.

Clinical features include sympathetic overactivity in response to hypoglycemia, CNS disturbance, significant weight gain, and painlessness. The gold standard test for diagnosis is the 72-hour fasting test, and an insulin-to-glucose ratio > 0.4 is consistent with insulinoma. Imaging tests like CECT or MRI can show hyperattenuating due to the rich vascular supply. At the same time, angiography can detect 70% of insulinomas >5 mm, and portal venous sampling is the best pre-operative localization method. Diazoxide is used to prevent or attenuate symptoms of hypoglycemia before surgical intervention, and insulinomas are well suited for laparoscopic resection or enucleation. Enucleation is the treatment of choice for insulinomas of the head of the pancreas , while distal pancreatectomy is the preferred treatment for insulinoma in the body or tail of the pancreas. With or without 5-fluorouracil, Streptozotocin is associated with improved survival in metastatic pancreatic endocrine tumors.</p>\n<p></p>",

The patient is hypotensive and has hyper-resonance in his chest on the side of the injury. This suggests the patient is having a tension pneumothorax. Treatment of Tension pneumothorax is immediate needle decompression by inserting a large-bore (eg, 14- or 16-gauge) needle into the 2nd intercostal space in the midclavicular line. Air will usually gush out. Because needle decompression causes a simple pneumothorax, tube thoracostomy should be done immediately afterward..</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency that can result in respiratory failure or cardiovascular collapse. It can be diagnosed clinically without the need for radiographic confirmation. The symptoms of tension pneumothorax include deviation of the trachea , unilaterally absent or diminished breath sounds, and cardiopulmonary compromise. If these symptoms are present, thoracic decompression should be rapidly performed with a large-bore needle or tube thoracostomy, depending on the availability of equipment and supplies.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In addition to tension pneumothorax, massive hemothorax requires tube thoracostomy to evacuate blood and reexpansion the lung. Severe pulmonary contusion may require aggressive mechanical ventilation with elevated levels of positive end-expiratory pressure. However, to avoid loss of positive end-expiratory pressure, the ventilator should not be repeatedly disconnected for suction or manual ventilation, as oxygenation will only improve with an uninterrupted circuit.</p>\n<p></p>",

Thyroglossal cysts can be defined as an irregular neck mass or a lump that develops from cells and tissues left over after the formation of the thyroid gland during developmental stages. Thyroglossal cysts are the most common cause of midline neck masses and are generally located caudal to (below) the hyoid bone. A thyroglossal duct cyst is a mass or lump in the front part of the neck that is filled with fluid. While a baby is developing in the womb, the thyroid gland begins at the base of the tongue. Before birth the thyroid gland moves in the neck to its usual position below the thyroid cartilage and above the sternum. A portion of this path in which the thyroid gland moves may fill with mucus-like fluid, creating a thyroglossal duct cyst.

( Murphy\u2019s triad & Aaron\u2019s sign positive) In this case, the next appropriate investigation would be serum lipase As initial investigation done in patients with acute pancreatitis are Lipase & Amylase. Acute pancreatitis is a sudden inflammation of the pancreas that may be mild or life-threatening but usually subsides. Gallstones and alcohol abuse are the main causes of acute pancreatitis. Severe abdominal pain is the predominant symptom. Causes in order of frequency include a gallstone impacted in the common bile duct beyond the point where the pancreatic duct joins it; heavy alcohol use; systemic disease; trauma; and, in minors, mumps. Acute pancreatitis may be a single event; it may be recurrent; or progress to chronic pancreatitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Acute pancreatitis (AP) is mild and self-limited in most patients. However, 10-20% of patients may experience a rapidly progressive inflammatory response associated with a prolonged hospital stay, significant morbidity, and mortality. Severe pancreatitis has a mortality rate of 10-30% and is often caused by multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and septic complications. AP results from abnormal pancreatic enzyme activation , leading to pancreatic tissue autodigestion and triggering an inflammatory response. Gallstones and ethanol abuse are the most common risk factors for AP. Clinical features include: epigastric pain, nausea/vomiting, and dehydration; severe cases may exhibit abdominal distention and rebound tenderness. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and elevated pancreatic enzyme levels, with lipase being a more specific marker than amylase. Treatment involves aggressive fluid resuscitation, analgesics, and enteral nutrition.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Complications of acute pancreatitis.

During CPB, anticoagulation is required to prevent blood clotting, and heparin is typically given in a dose of 300-400 units/kg to increase the activated clotting time (ACT) to greater than 450 seconds. Once adequate anticoagulation is achieved, arterial cannulation is performed through a purse-string suture or side graft onto the native artery, typically at the distal ascending thoracic aorta (most common site), femoral artery, axillary artery, innominate artery, or distal aortic arch, depending on the surgical repair needed and presence of native arterial disease. Venous cannulation is performed through purse-string sutures placed on the right atrium or through a femoral vein with TEE guidance in minimally invasive cardiac surgery.

Mechanism : Serious infection, such as secondary peritonitis, may lead to SIRS through the release of lipopolysaccharide endotoxin from the walls of dying Gram-negative bacilli (mainly Escherichia coli) or other bacteria or fungi. This and other toxins stimulate the release of cytokines from macrophages. Septic manifestations and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in SIRS are mediated by the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1). There are high circulating levels of cytokines and activated neutrophils that stimulate fever, tachycardia, and tachypnoea. Gut failure, colonization, and translocation are related to developing systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor;\u2019 necrosis factor. MODS - an effect that SIRS produces systemically The activated neutrophils adhere to vascular endothelium in key organs remote from the source of infection and damage it, leading to increased vascular permeability, which in turn leads to cellular damage within the organs, which become dysfunctional and give rise to the clinical picture of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome or MODS. MSOF - end stage of uncontrolled MODS Respiratory, cardiac, intestinal, renal, and liver failure ensue with circulatory failure and shock. In this state, the body\u2019s resistance to infection is reduced, and a vicious cycle develops where the more organs that fill, the more likely it becomes that death will follow despite all that a modern ICU can do for organ support SEPSIS: Sepsis is SIRS with a documented source of infection Severe sepsis or sepsis syndrome is sepsis with evidence of the failure of one or more organs: Respiratory (acute respiratory distress syndrome) Cardiovascular (septic shock follows compromise of cardiac function and fall in peripheral vascular resistance) Renal (usually acute tubular necrosis), Hepatic, Blood coagulation systems or central nervous system SEPSIS BUNDLE (also known as the resuscitation bundle) : a combination of evidence-based objectives that must be completed within 6 hours for patients presenting with severe sepsis, septic shock and lactate >4 mmol/L SEPSIS SIX : Name given to a bundle of medical therapies designed to reduce mortality in patients with sepsis.
