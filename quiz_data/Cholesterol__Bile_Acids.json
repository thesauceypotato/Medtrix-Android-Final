Elevated triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol, premature cholesterol gallstone can result from blocking cholesterol breakdown enzymes. As a result, cholesterol accumulates in the bile along with the decreased synthesis of bile salt, which helps in cholesterol deposition leading to the formation of cholesterol gallstones. Statin therapy can control the only rate of cholesterol synthesis but cannot accelerate cholesterol degradation. The increase in blood triglyceride levels in CYP7A1 deficiency is not well understood, but there is a reciprocal relationship between bile acid synthesis and TG levels. Finally, as siblings have same conditions, it appears to be a genetic disorder, which points to a possible mutated gene and likely prevents the function of CYP7A1.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option: A - HMG-CoA reductase function loss will also lead to decreased formation of cholesterol, but this patient has high cholesterol levels.
