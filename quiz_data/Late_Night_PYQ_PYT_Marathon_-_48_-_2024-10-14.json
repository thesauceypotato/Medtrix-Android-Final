TCAs block muscarinic receptors, which can decrease the outflow of aqueous humor in the eye, leading to increased intraocular pressure. This can precipitate an acute glaucoma attack, particularly in patients with angle-closure glaucoma, who are already at risk due to impaired aqueous humor drainage. Therefore, amitriptyline should be avoided in this patient population.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

Standard IOL calculation methods often fail in these cases because the surgery alters corneal curvature, making conventional formulas inaccurate. The Haigis-L formula uses statistical data to determine IOL power based on the altered corneal properties of post-refractive surgery eyes without requiring historical data, which is often unavailable. This approach is particularly useful for eyes that have undergone procedures like LASIK, ensuring better refractive outcomes.

This is to prevent damage to the neurovascular bundle, which runs along the lower border of each rib (comprising the intercostal vein, artery, and nerve).

Identified 5th intercostal space anterior to mid axillary line to place the tube: The 5th intercostal space anterior to the mid-axillary line is a commonly selected site for the insertion of an ICD. This location is within the \"triangle of safety,\" which is bounded by the lateral border of the pectoralis major anteriorly, the latissimus dorsi posteriorly, and the horizontal level of the nipple below. This area minimizes the risk of injuring important structures, including the long thoracic nerve and vessels.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Identified 5th intercostal space anterior to mid axillary line to place the tube:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Directed tube posteriorly to prevent injury: Directing the tube posteriorly initially helps ensure that it enters the pleural space without injuring the lung. Once inside the pleural cavity, the direction of the tube may be adjusted based on the specific indication for the ICD, such as draining an effusion versus a pneumothorax.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Directed tube posteriorly to prevent injury:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Incised and digitally explored: After making a skin incision, blunt dissection and digital exploration are performed to ensure that there are no obstructions or adhesions and to create a safe pathway for the tube.
