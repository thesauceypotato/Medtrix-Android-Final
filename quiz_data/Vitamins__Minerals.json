DNA synthesis indirectly requires Folic acid (folate required for conversion of dUMP to dTMP, leading to decreased thymidine, which is required for DNA synthesis). In Folic acid deficiency, DNA replication and, thus, cell division are affected. The cytoplasm of folate deficient cells grows at a normal rate, but cell division is delayed. So abnormally large cells are formed. This leads to megaloblastic anemia. As Folate is required for homocysteine to methionine conversion, its deficiency will cause homocysteine accumulation in serum. All Rapidly dividing cells, e.g. bone marrow and intestinal mucosa, are most affected. Supplements of Folate given in appropriate doses before conception can significantly reduce the incidence of Spina Bifida and other neural tube defects. Option b.

Absorption and Transport of Iron Absorption in the intestinal cell: Cytochrome b reductase one or Duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb ) is a ferric reductase enzyme that converts Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ , and aids the entry of Fe 2+ into the mucosal cell The ferrous iron is then transported in the cell by a divalent metal transporter (DMT-1). Divalent Metal/Cation Transporter 1(DMT1 or DCT1) is Located on the apical membrane of enterocytes. Body iron stores regulate DMT1 expression to maintain iron homeostasis. Transport in blood: For transport, ferrous iron needs to be oxidized to ferric iron. This is done by hephaestin , a membrane-associated ferroxidase protein . In the blood, ceruloplasmin, a copper-containing ferroxidase, oxidizes any ferrous iron to ferric iron Transferrin can carry two molecules of ferric ion. (apo transferrin + 2 Fe 3+ = Holo-transferrin) Transferrin delivers the iron to different tissue cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Drug warfarin interferes with the recycling of vitamin K (see Fig). Hydroquinone form of Vitamin K activates a glutamate residue in the protein substrate to a carbanion, which reacts nonenzymatically with carbon dioxide to form \u03b3-carboxyglutamate. Vitamin K epoxide is reduced to quinone by an epoxide reductase , and the quinone is reduced to the active hydroquinone by Vitamin K reductase. Dicumarol & warfarin inhibits the enzyme ( reductase ) that converts epoxide to active Vitamin K (hydroquinone). Hence all of the factors mentioned above will have decreased carboxy glutamate residues in patient taking warfarin.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Elevated parathyroid hormone This patient is most probably suffering from vitamin D deficiency and osteomalacia looking at the symptoms of his poor diet and indoor lifestyle. On the radiographic exam, osteomalacia can manifest with bone pain, muscle weakness, and reduced bone density. Vitamin D can be consumed from plants (ergocalciferol) or formed in sun-exposed skin (cholecalciferol). The active form of vitamin D is 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol), produced in the kidney by the enzyme 1\u03b1-hydroxylase (See vitamin D biosynthesis figure in text). Calcium homeostasis in the body is maintained by the interplay of calcitonin and parathyroid (PTH) hormones (refer to Fig).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- This patient suffers from hypocalcemia, as indicated by reduced bone density. Vitamin D increases calcium reabsorption in the intestine and from both the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts of the kidney. So, Vitamin D deficiency will cause hypocalcemia (low serum calcium). 1a-Hydoxylase catalyzes the formation of 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol), the active form of vitamin D. In response to hypocalcemia, the body increases parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. PTH stimulates 1\u03b1-hydroxylase to maintain serum calcium. This patient has signs of hypocalcemia and would be expected to have increased activity of 1a-hydroxylase, not decreased. This patient has vitamin D deficiency and osteomalacia. As 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol is synthesized from ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), its levels would decrease.</p>\n<p></p>",

INH inhibits pyridoxal kinase. It is needed to phosphorylate Pyridoxine into pyridoxal 5-P leading to its deficiency in the body. Another concept is INH forms complex with pyridoxine to form hydrazone. It brings about incomplete phosphorylation of pyridoxine. INH inhibits the enzyme pyridoxal kinase, which is necessary for the phosphorylation of pyridoxine. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) supplementation during isoniazid (INH) therapy is necessary for some patients to prevent the development of peripheral neuropathy. As Vit. B6 (PLP) is required for Niacin synthesis from tryptophan. Hence Isoniazid therapy also causes Niacin deficiency.</p>\n<p></p>",
