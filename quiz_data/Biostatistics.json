The quantitative data have a magnitude. The characteristics are measured either on an interval or on a ratio scale. The quantitative data obtained from characteristic variables are also called continuous data as each individual has one measurement from a continuous spectrum or range such as body temperature from 35\u201342\u00b0C, height from 150\u2013180 cm, weight from 10-100 Kg, pulse rate from 68\u201384 per minute and so on. The observations ascend or descend from 0 or any starting point in the spectrum range, such as the systolic blood pressure of 100 individuals rising from the lowest 90 mmHg to the highest 150 mmHg. The characteristic may be measurable in whole numbers and fractions, such as chest circumference\u201433 cm, 34.5 cm, 35.2 cm, 36 cm, 37.3 cm, and so on, or it may be measurable or countable in discrete whole numbers only, such as pulse rate; cholesterol; blood pressure; ESR; blood sugar; etc.</p>\n<p></p>",

These categories cannot be ordered in a meaningful way. The variables can be grouped into categories, and each category's frequency or percentage can be calculated. The data can also be presented visually using a pie chart. For e.g., male/female. OPTION B - Categorical data is a type of data that can be stored into groups or categories with the aid of names or labels. This grouping is usually made according to the data characteristics and similarities of these characteristics through a method known as matching. To graph categorical data, one uses bar charts and pie charts. Bar chart: Bar charts use rectangular bars to plot qualitative data against its quantity. Unlike histograms, the bars have spaces in between. Pie chart: Pie charts are circular graphs in which various slices have different arc lengths depending on their quantity. OPTION C - Quantitative data refers to any information that can be quantified, counted, measured, or given a numerical value. Qualitative data is descriptive, expressed in terms of language rather than numerical values. Quantitative research is based on numeric data.

So at the start of the rainy season, and decides to Calculate the Utensil index. So which method of sampling would be appropriate for him?",

A population list\u2014a list of all schoolchildren\u2014would be near-impossible to come by, so you cannot take a sample of the population. Instead, you divide the population into states and take a simple random sample of states. For the next stage, you might take a simple random sample of schools within those states. Finally, you could perform simple random sampling on the students within the schools to get your sample.

This method is used when units of the population are natural groups or clusters such as villages, wards, blocks, slums of a town, factories, workshops, or children of a school, etc. Fortunately, the cluster sampling technique allows a small number of the target population to be sampled while the data provided is statistically valid at 95% confidence limits (10% variation). From the chosen clusters, 30 in number, the entire population is surveyed. Cluster sampling gives a higher standard error, but this method's data collection is simpler and involves less time and cost than other sampling techniques. As per the module approved by WHO, it is most often used to evaluate vaccination coverage in the Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) and Universal Immunization Programme (UIP), where only 210 children, taking seven from each cluster in the age group 12\u201323 months are to be examined.</p>\n<p></p>",
