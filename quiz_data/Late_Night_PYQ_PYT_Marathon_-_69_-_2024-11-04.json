This virus is typically transmitted via respiratory droplets and primarily causes a mild infection characterized by a rash, low fever, and swollen glands. However, its most significant health impact occurs when a pregnant woman is infected, particularly in the first trimester, leading to congenital rubella syndrome.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
