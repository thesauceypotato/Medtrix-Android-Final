Partial agonists have a lower intrinsic activity at receptors than full agonists, allowing them to act either as a functional agonist or a functional antagonist, depending on the surrounding levels of naturally occurring neurotransmitter (full agonist). Option B - drug C do not have any activity irrespective of the ligand concentration - so it is not likely to be an agonist. Option D - drug C do not have any activity irrespective of the ligand concentration - so it is not likely to be a partial agonist. Based on this there are 4 types of intrinsic activity given the graph: Agonist 1 Partial Agonist 0-1 Antagonist 0 Inverse Agonist -ve Drug A has maximum activity and Drug D is negative hence Option C is the correct answer.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Competitive The given graph is a LINEWEAVER BURKE PLOT between 1/V and 1/S</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Competitive inhibition is interruption of a chemical pathway owing to one chemical substance inhibiting the effect of another by competing with it for binding or bonding. An example of a competitive inhibitor is the antineoplastic drug methotrexate. Methotrexate has a structure similar to that of the vitamin folic acid. It acts by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, preventing the regeneration of dihydrofolate from tetrahydrofolate. Noncompetitive inhibition, a type of allosteric regulation, is a specific type of enzyme inhibition characterized by an inhibitor binding to an allosteric site resulting in decreased efficacy of the enzyme. An allosteric site is simply a site that differs from the active site- where the substrate binds. The inhibitory effects of heavy metals, and of cyanide on cytochrome oxidase and of arsenate on glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, are examples of non-competitive inhibition. This type of inhibitor acts by combining with the enzyme in such a way that for some reason the active site is rendered inoperative. In Competitive inhibition Vmax remains the same while Km changes In noncompetitive inhibition Km remains the same while Vmax changes Reversible uncompetitive inhibition occurs when (I) binds only to the enzyme-substrate complex (ES) and not free E. One can hypothesize that on binding S, a conformational change in E occurs which presents a binding site for I. Inhibition occurs since ESI cannot form product. In un competitive inhibition both Km and Vmax remains different.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Neuritis, orchitis, uveitis, periostitis, lymphadenitis, and glomerulonephritis can occur rarely. Never stop MDT in pregnancy. Anti-inflammatory agents are to be added hence corticosteroids needs to be added.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - Thalidomide is not safe in pregnancy. Thalidomide is highly effective in the treatment of patients with chronic or recurrent ENL. It acts by inhibition of selective gene expression of tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) involved in the pathogenesis of nerve damage in leprosy and other mechanisms contributing to its anti-inflammatory effect Option B - MDT is not stopped in this - Treatment for severe type 2 lepra reactions may include: Prednisone at a dose of about 1 mg/kg/day, quickly tapered. Clofazimine (note that the multibacillary regimen with clofazimine prevents type 2 lepra reactions) Thalidomide 400 mg/day for 5\u201310 days, tapered over 1\u20132 months. Option D - Hansen's disease is treated with a combination of antibiotics. Typically, 2 or 3 antibiotics are used at the same time. These are dapsone with rifampicin, and clofazimine is added for some types of the disease.</p>\n<p></p>",

Oculogyric crisis refers to the spasm of the extraocular muscles. usually causing upward and outward deviation of the eyes and is a severe form of acute dystonia; an extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotics like Risperidone. It can be treated by antimuscarinic drugs (subtype of anticholinergic drugs) like promethazine. Dystonia is acute in onset and occurs within 1-5 days of starting treatment It is more common in the younger population. The proposed mechanism of action is D2 blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway. There is typical involvement of head and neck muscles and presents in a variety of forms such as torticollis, trismus, mouth opening dystonia, grimacing, dysarthria, oculogyric crisis, blepharospasm and swallowing difficulties. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic with D2 blocking but strong 5HT2 antagonistic activity. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine and thus, its adverse effects include sedation, light-headedness, confusional state, weight gain, etc. Olanzapine is also an atypical antipsychotic.
