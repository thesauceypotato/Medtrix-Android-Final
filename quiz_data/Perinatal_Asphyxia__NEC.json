Umbilical granuloma can be seen in some newborns after falling off the umbilical cord . It is the persistence of granulation tissue at the base of the umbilicus. The tissue is soft, 3 to 10mm in size, vascular and granular, colored dull red /pink, and may have a seropurulent discharge. Granulation tissue is treated by cauterizing with silver nitrate. Aspiration of sac contents is never done in an umbilical hernia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hernia appears as a soft swelling covered by skin that protrudes during crying, coughing, and straining in newborns and can be reduced easily through the fibrous ring at the umbilicus. In newborns, it can appear from birth to 6 months, and the majority will heal spontaneously. Rarely do they require surgery. Surgery is not advised unless the hernia persists for 4-5 years, causes symptoms, becomes strangulated, or becomes progressively larger after 1-2 years.</p>\n<p></p>",
