      "text": "A 44-year-old woman who recently lost her job because of absenteeism, presents to her physician complaining of loss of appetite, fatigue, muscle weakness, and emotional depression. The physical examination reveals a somewhat enlarged liver that feels firm and nodular, and there is a hint of jaundice in the sclerae and a hint of alcohol on her breath. The initial laboratory profile included a hematological analysis that showed that she had an anemia with enlarged red blood cells (macrocytic). A bone marrow aspirate confirmed the suspicion that she has a megaloblastic anemia because it showed a greater than normal number of red and white blood cell precursors, most of which were larger than normal. Further analyses revealed that her serum folic acid level was 2.9 ng/mL (normal = 6 to 15), her serum B12 level was 153 pg/mL (normal = 150 to 750), and her serum iron level was normal. The patient\u2019s megaloblastic anemia is most likely caused by which of the following? \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b",
