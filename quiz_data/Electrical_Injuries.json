      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>High Voltage electric burns High voltage burns may be very severe with the charring of the body. Multiple individual and confluent areas of third-degree burns are seen. 1000 volts will jump several mm, and 100 kilovolts about 35 cm. Very high voltage currents produce massive tissue destruction with loss of extremities and rupture of organs. When bone is involved, the periosteum may be elevated, superficial layers of the bone may be destroyed, or fracture may occur. Sometimes, multiple lesions are found in the region of flexures of a limb where the current has passed across the joints instead of passing around it. High-tension electrical currents may produce multiple, small, discrete, pitted burns due to arcing from the conductor to the body without direct contact. Multiple burnt or punched-out lesions are produced due to the arc dancing over the body surface over large areas, which present 'crocodile flash burns'. Flashover often produces 'arc eye'. High amperage has an explosive blast-like effect and may produce injuries resembling bullet, stab or incised wounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A, B & D. Drowning, Neck Ligature or High-temperature water burns do not resemble the skin type shown in the Illustration above. Hence these three options are not the correct answers.</p>\n<p></p>",
