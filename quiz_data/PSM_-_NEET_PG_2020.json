The methods of management based on behavioural sciences are: Organizational design A poor organizational design leads to wastage of resources. The organization should be setup in such a way that is appropriate to the goals to be achieved. For example,  a health system should be able to service the health needs of the population. The technology used should be kept up to date by regular upgrades. Personnel management Human resource is the most important part of an organization. Proper methods of selection, training, motivation, allotment of roles, incentives and avenues for professional advancement should be ensured. Communication Communication between various levels is essential functioning of the system. Doctor-patient, doctor-nurse, health ministry-doctors \u2013 measures should be taken to ensure that there is free communication at these levels. Lacunae in the communication system results in Delayed reporting of events Delayed supply of drugs and other resources Decreased efficiency of organizational function Information system An efficient information system should be in place to manage all the data. There should be a system for effective collection, classification, storage, retrieval, transformation and display of data. The information system plays an important part in monitoring and evaluation of the health system. Management by Objectives (MBO) In this, objectives are set for each unit and subunit of the system.
