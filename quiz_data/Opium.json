      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Opium Opium poisoning shows the following features:- Stage of Excitement: There is an increased sense of well-being, increased mental activity, freedom from anxiety, talkativeness, restlessness or even hallucinations, flushing of the face, and a greatly excited or maniacal condition may be seen. Stage of Stupor: The symptoms are headache, nausea, vomiting, incapacity for exertion, a sense of weight in the limbs, giddiness, and drowsiness. The subject lies motionless, with eyes closed as if in a sound sleep from which he may be aroused at first, but soon passes into a stupor and coma. The pupils are contracted, the face and lips are cyanosed and an itching sensation is felt all over the skin. The pulse and respirations are normal. Stage of Coma: The patient passes into a deep coma from which he cannot be roused. The muscles become flaccid and relaxed and all reflexes are abolished. The face is pale, and conjunctivae congested. The pupils are contracted to pinpoint the size and do not react to light but dilate during the agonal asphyxial phase caused by respiratory depression and ultimate paralysis. All the secretions are suspended except sweat. Perspiration is very much increased. The skin is cold and often covered with perspiration. Temperature is subnormal. Blood pressure is low, the pulse slow and full, the breathing is slow and stertorous, and may be reduced to 3 to 4 per minute. The odour of opium may be present in breath.</p>\n<p></p>",
