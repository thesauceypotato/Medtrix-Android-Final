A) Round ligament</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The round ligament is responsible for maintaining the anteversion of the uterus, particularly during pregnancy. It consists of smooth muscle extensions of the uterine corpus and is the homologue of the gubernaculum testis. These ligaments arise from the lateral aspect of the corpus just below and anterior to the origin of the fallopian tubes, extend laterally to the pelvic sidewall, and enter the retroperitoneal space. They pass lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels before entering the inguinal canal through the internal inguinal ring and terminate in the subcutaneous tissue of the labia majora.

Treatment focuses on addressing the root cause and managing symptoms to protect eye function and quality of life.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
