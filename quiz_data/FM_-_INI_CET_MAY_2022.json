Lugol\u2019s Iodine test identifies glycogen in the vaginal cells which turns black on filter paper upon exposure to Lugol\u2019s iodine vapour. It follows Locard\u2019s principle of exchange. However, it is important to note that it was later also discovered that the same is found in the male efferent urinary trac t, hence it was disclosed that Lugol\u2019s iodine is not suitable to forensically determine vaginal epithelial cells on penis specimens following sexual intercourse. Nevertheless, buccal cells which are also found in saliva , it was discovered similarly that the cells reacted in the same way with similar morphological features as vaginal cells after using the Lugol\u2019s iodine stain.
