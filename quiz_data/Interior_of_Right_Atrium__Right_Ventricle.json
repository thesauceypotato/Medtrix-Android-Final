Options explanation Statement 1: The upper end is prolonged to the left to form the right auricle. The auricle covers the root of the ascending aorta and partly overlaps the infundibulum of the right ventricle. Its margins are notched, and the interior is sponge-like, which prevents the free flow of blood. Statement 2: The AV node is present in the triangle of Koch in the atrioventricular septum. Statement 3: Along the right border of the atrium, a shallow vertical groove passes from the superior vena cava to the inferior vena cava. This groove is called the sulcus terminalis. It is produced by an internal muscular ridge called the crista terminalis. The upper part of the sulcus contains the sinoatrial or SA node, which acts as the pacemaker of the heart, Statement 4: coronary sinus is present in the coronary sulcus in the atrioventricular groove.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The right atrium receives and holds deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, anterior cardiac veins, most minor cardiac veins, and the coronary sinus, which it then sends down to the right ventricle (through the tricuspid valve), which turn sends it to the pulmonary artery for pulmonary circulation. Interior of Right Atrium</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The sinoatrial (SA) node is located in the posterior aspect of the right atrium, next to the superior vena cava. This is a group of pacemaker cells that spontaneously depolarize to create an action potential.

The anterior part of the right atrium, including the right auricle, is sometimes referred to as the atrium proper. This terminology is based on its origin in the embryonic primitive atrium . Its walls are covered by ridges called the musculi pectinate (pectinate muscles), which fan out from the crista like the \"teeth of a comb.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>An additional structure in the right atrium is the opening of the coronary sinus, which receives blood from most of the cardiac veins and opens medially to the beginning of the inferior vena cava.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options :- Option A: The interatrial septum has an opening in the right atrium, the foramen ovale, which provides access to the left atrium; this connects the two chambers, which is essential for fetal blood circulation. a foramen ovale is no longer needed and closes to leave a depression (the fossa ovalis) in the atrial wall. The annulus ovalis or limbus fossa ovalis is the prominent margin of the fossa ovalis. It represents the lower free edge of the septum secundum. Option B: Along the right border of the atrium, there is a shallow vertical groove that passes from the superior vena cava to the inferior vena cava. This groove is called the sulcus terminalis. It is produced by an internal muscular ridge called the crista terminalis. Option D: The posterior part of the right atrium is termed the sinus venarum; it also includes most of the lateral wall of the chamber. It has a relatively smooth surface compared to the anterior part. The posterior and anterior walls merge at the crista terminalis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The fossa ovalis marks the location of the embryonic foramen ovale, which is an essential part of fetal circulation.

And then, it ends in the upper and posterior part of the sinus venarum of the right atrium, at the upper right front portion of the heart. Option B. Coronary sinus The coronary sinus is located in the posterior portion of the coronary sulcus on the diaphragmatic or rear surface of the heart. The coronary sinus empties directly into the right atrium near the conjunction of the posterior interventricular sulcus and the coronary sulcus (crux cordis area), located between the inferior vena cava and tricuspid valve; this atrial ostium can be partially covered by Thebesian valve, although the anatomy of this valve is highly variable. Option C. Thebesian veins The Thebesian valve is a caudal remnant of the embryonic sinoatrial valve.
