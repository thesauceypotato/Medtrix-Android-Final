Three maneuvers help to gain the length required to bring the testis down to the bottom of the scrotum. First, the patent processus vaginalis should be identified, separated, and ligated. Second, the coverings of the spermatic cord (including the cremasteric muscle) should be divided. Third, lateral fibrous bands inside the internal inguinal ring should be divided . Sometimes for higher undescended tesits two-staged procedure is necessary. The testis is mobilized as far as possible and anchored with a suture, and the mobilization is completed six months later. Although these techniques are usually effective, the tiny vas and testicular vessels are vulnerable to injury. The empty hemiscrotum is stretched with a finger passed into it through the inguinal incision to give enough room for the testis, which is placed in a pouch between the dartos muscle and the skin. The alternative approach involves the initial division of the gonadal artery such that the testis become dependent for its blood supply upon the cremaster artery, followed by orchidopexy</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Orchidopexy does not decrease the malignancy risk associated with undescended testes, but it allows for earlier detection.</p>\n<p></p>",

Three maneuvers help to gain the length required to bring the testis down to the bottom of the scrotum. First, the patent processus vaginalis should be identified, separated, and ligated. Second, the coverings of the spermatic cord (including the cremasteric muscle) should be divided Third, lateral fibrous bands just inside the internal inguinal ring should be divided . Sometimes, for higher undescended tests two-staged procedure is necessary. The testis is mobilized as far as possible and anchored with a suture, and the mobilization is completed six months later. Although these techniques are usually effective, the tiny vas and testicular vessels are vulnerable to injury. The empty hemiscrotum is stretched with a finger passed into it through the inguinal incision to give enough room for the testis, which is placed in a pouch constructed between the dartos muscle and the skin The alternative approach involves the initial division of the gonadal artery such that the testis become dependent for its blood supply upon the cremaster artery, followed by orchidopexy</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Orchidopexy does not decrease the malignancy risk associated with undescended testes, but it allows for earlier detection</p>\n<p></p>",

Small acquired hydroceles do not need treatment . Surgical treatment is indicated if they are sizeable and bothersome for the patient. Established acquired hydroceles often have thick walls. There are three main surgical techniques for hydroceles; Plication : Lord\u2019s operation is suitable when the sac is reasonably thin-walled. There is minimal dissection, and the risk of haematoma is reduced. Eversion : The sac is opened and everted behind the testis, with the placement of the testis in a pouch prepared by dissection in the fascial planes of the scrotum (Jaboulay\u2019s procedure) Excision : Unless great care is taken to stop bleeding after excision of the wall, haemorrhage from the cut edge is liable to cause a large scrotal haematoma. This approach is not recommended. Aspiration of the hydrocoele fluid is simple, but the fluid always reaccumulates within a week or so. It may suit men unfit for scrotal surgery, although hydrocoele surgery can be undertaken under local anaesthetic. Aspiration can result in bleeding into the hydrocoele sac and haematocoele formation. Injection of a sclerosant, such as a tetracycline, is effective but painful.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Hydrocele may also be associated with other conditions, such as epididymitis, testicular torsion, and testicular appendage torsion.
