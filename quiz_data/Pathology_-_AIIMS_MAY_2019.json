It is a difficult morphologic change to appreciate with the light microscope; it may be more apparent at the level of the whole organ. When it affects many cells , it causes some pallor, increased turgor, and an increase in the weight of the organ . On microscopic examination , small clear vacuoles may be seen within the cytoplasm ; these represent distended and pinched-off segments of the ER . This pattern of nonlethal injury is sometimes called hydropic change or vacuolar degeneration . The swelling of cells is reversible. Cells may also show increased eosinophilic staining , which becomes much more pronounced with progression to necrosis . Epithelial cells of the proximal tubule showing early cell injury resulting from reperfusion following ischemia. The microvilli are lost and have been incorporated in apical cytoplasm; blebs have formed and are extruded in the lumen. Mitochondria (M) would have been swollen during ischemia; with reperfusion, they rapidly undergo condensation and become electron-dense</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The ultrastructural changes of reversible cell injury, visible by electron microscopy, include the following: Plasma membrane alterations, such as blebbing , blunting, and loss of microvilli Mitochondrial changes, including swelling and the appearance of small amorphous densities Accumulation of \u201c myelin figures \u201d in the cytosol composed of phospholipids derived from damaged cellular membranes Dilation of the ER, with the detachment of polysomes Nuclear alterations , with disaggregation of granular and fibrillar elements Nuclear change s appear in one of three patterns : The basophilia of the chromatin may fade Karyolysis Pyknosis is characterised by nuclear shrinkage and increased basophilia.

In coronary arteries, myocardial contractility is reversed if circulation is quickly restored. It also depends upon the organ which undergoes hypoxia. Ex, skeletal muscle can withstand half an hour with cell injury but brain cells can undergo permanent damage within 10 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Features of Necrosis and Apoptosis Feature Necrosis Apoptosis Cell size Enlarged (swelling) Reduced (shrinkage) Nucleus Pyknosis, karyorrhexis, karyolysis Fragmentation into nucleosome-size fragments Plasma membrane Disrupted Intact; altered structure, especially orientation of lipids Cellular contents Enzymatic digestion; may leak out of cell Intact; may be released in apoptotic bodies Adjacent inflammation Frequent No Physiologic or pathologic role Usually pathologic (culmination of irreversible cell injury) Often physiologic, means of eliminating unwanted cells; may be pathologic after some forms of cell injury, especially DNA damage</p>\n<p></p>",

The p53 protein is the central monitor of stress in the cell and can be activated by anoxia, inappropriate signaling by mutated oncoproteins, or DNA damage . p53 controls the expression and activity of proteins involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, cellular senescence, and apoptosis. DNA damage is sensed by complexes containing kinases of the ATM/ATR family ; these kinases phosphorylate p53, liberating it from inhibitors such as MDM2. Active p53 then upregulates the expression of proteins such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 , thereby causing cell-cycle arrest at the G1 /S checkpoint . This pause allows cells to repair DNA damage. If DNA damage cannot be repaired , p53 induces additional events that lead to cellular senescence or apoptosis .

The most frequent reaction associated with the transfusion of cellular blood components is a febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction ( FNHTR ).

FNHTR is diagnosed when other causes of fever in the transfused patient are ruled out i.e. diagnosis of exclusion . Antibodies directed against donor leukocyte and HLA antigens may mediate these reactions; thus, multiply transfused patients and multiparous women are felt to be at increased risk . The use of leukocyte-reduced blood products may prevent or delay sensitization to leukocyte antigens and thereby reduce the incidence of these febrile episodes .

Changes in vascular flow and caliber begin early after injury and consist of the following. Vasodilation is mediated by histamine , on vascular smooth muscle. It is one of the earliest manifestations of acute inflammation . Vasodilation first involves the arteriole s and then leads to opening of new capillary beds in the area. The result is increased blood flow, which is the cause of heat and redness (erythema) at the site of inflammation. Vasodilation is quickly followed by increased permeability of the microvasculature , with the outpouring of protein-rich fluid into the extravascular tissues. The loss of fluid and increased vessel diameter lead to slower blood flow , concentration of red cells in small vessels, and increased viscosity of the blood . These changes result in engorgement of small vessels with slowly moving red cells, a condition termed stasis , which is seen as vascular congestion and localized redness of the involved tissue. As stasis develops, blood leukocytes, principally neutrophils, accumulate along the vascular endothelium . Leukocytes then adhere to the endothelium, and soon afterward they migrate through the vascular wall into the interstitial tissue as vascular congestion and localized redness of the involved tissue. Contraction of endothelial cells resulting in opening of interendothelial gaps is the most common mechanism of vascular leakage. It is elicited by histamine , bradykinin , leukotrienes , and other chemical mediators. It is called the immediate transient response because it occurs rapidly after exposure to the mediator and is usually short-lived (15 to 30 minutes). In some forms of mild injury (e.g., after burns, irradiation or ultraviolet radiation, and exposure to certain bacterial toxins ), vascular leakage begins after a delay of 2 to 12 hours and lasts for several hours or even days; this delayed prolonged leakage may be caused by contraction of endothelial cells or mild endothelial damage. Sunburn is a classic example of damage that results in late-appearing vascular leakage. Often the immediate and delayed responses occur along a continuum. Endothelial injury resulting in endothelial cell necrosis and detachment . Direct damage to the endothelium is encountered in severe physical injuries, for example, in thermal burns, or is induced by the actions of microbes and microbial toxins that damage endothelial cells . Neutrophils that adhere to the endothelium during inflammation may also injure endothelial cells and thus amplify the reaction. In most instances leakage starts immediately after injury and is sustained for several hours until the damaged vessels are thrombosed or repaired.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: a = 1 / b = 2 / c = 3.

Each mitochondrion contains thousands of copies of mtDNA, and typically, deleterious mtDNA mutations affect some but not all of these copies. Thus, tissues and individuals may harbour both wild-type and mutant mtDNA, a heteroplasmy situation. Mitochondria and their contained DNA are randomly distributed to the daughter cells during cell division. Thus, when a cell containing normal and mutant mtDNA divides, the proportion of the normal and mutant mtDNA in daughter cells is extremely variable. Therefore, the expression of disorders resulting from mutations in mtDNA is quite variable .
