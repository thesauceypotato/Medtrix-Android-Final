      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1, 3 and 5 only The depolarization, also called the rising phase, is caused when positively charged sodium ions (Na+) suddenly rush through open voltage-gated sodium channels into a neuron. As additional sodium rushes in, the membrane potential actually reverses its polarity. During this change of polarity the membrane actually develops a positive value for a moment (+40 millivolts). The repolarization or falling phase is caused by the slow closing of sodium channels and the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels. As a result, the membrane permeability to sodium declines to resting levels. As the sodium ion entry declines, the slow voltage-gated potassium channels open and potassium ions rush out of the cell. This expulsion acts to restore the localized negative membrane potential of the cell. Hyperpolarization is a phase where some potassium channels remain open and sodium channels reset. A period of increased potassium permeability results in excessive potassium efflux before the potassium channels close. This results in hyperpolarization as seen in a slight dip following the spike</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The steps in an action potential in muscle fire and the neuron, are similar except for the quantitative differences, such as: RMP is -80 to -90 mV in skeletal muscle fibres, while it is about -70mV in neurons.

The velocity of conduction is about 3-5m/s, which is about 1/13th of the velocity of the nerve fibre.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>3 only Only statement 3 is correct. During the contraction of the skeletal muscle, Ca is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Acetylcholine released from the axon terminal binds to receptors on the sarcolemma. An action potential is generated and travels down the T tubule. Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to the change in voltage. Ca2+ binds troponin; Cross-bridges form between actin and myosin. Acetylcholinesterase removes acetylcholine from the synaptic cleft. Ca2+ is transported back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Tropomyosin binds active sites on actin causing the cross-bridge to detach. Excitation contraction coupling refers to the process by which the membrane depolarization of the muscle fibre (excitation) leads to the contraction of the muscle. The steps of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle are as follows: Motor-neuron discharge causes the release of acetylcholine at the motor endplate, which binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This causes increased Na+ and K+ conductance in the endplate membrane leading to the generation of end-plate potential, which is a local potential. When the local endplate potential reaches a threshold for the muscle fibre an action potential is generated. The generated action potential passes inward through the T tubules leading to the spread of depolarisation. The depolarization of the muscle fibre causes the release of Ca from terminal cisterns of sarcoplasmic reticulum and diffusion to thick and thin filaments. The released calcium binds to troponin C uncovering myosin-binding sites on actin. The formation of cross-linkages between actin and myosin and sliding of thin on thick filaments causes contraction of the skeletal muscle.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Steps in relaxation: The cytoplasmic calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by the action of SERCA (sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase). Once the calcium concentration is lowered, the interaction between actin and myosin ceases and the muscle relaxes.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Polycationic, Neutral, Polyanionic Let\u2019s Understand This graphs phenomenon:- Figure Above shows nfluence of the size and electrical charge of dextran on its filterability. A value of 1 indicates that it is filtered freely, whereas a value of zero indicates that it is not filtered. The filterability of dextrans between approximately 20 and 42 \u00c5 depends on charge. Dextrans larger than 42 \u00c5 are not filtered regardless of charge, and polycationic dextrans and neutral dextrans smaller than 20 \u00c5 are freely filtered. The major proteins in plasma are albumin and immunoglobulin s. Because the effective molecular radii of IgG (53 \u00c5) and IgM (>100 \u00c5) are greater than 42 \u00c5, they are not filtered. Although the effective molecular radius of albumin is 35 \u00c5, it is a polyanionic protein, so it does not cross the filtration barrier to a significant degree.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Glomerulus Structure: Blood plasma enters the afferent arteriole and flows into the glomerulus, a cluster of intertwined capillaries. The Bowman\u2019s capsule (also called the glomerular capsule) surrounds the glomerulus and is composed of visceral (simple squamous epithelial cells\u2014inner) and parietal (simple squamous epithelial cells\u2014outer) layers. The visceral layer lies just beneath the thickened glomerular basement membrane and is made of podocytes that form small slits in which the fluid passes through into the nephron. The size of the filtration slits restricts the passage of large molecules (such as albumin) and cells (such as red blood cells and platelets) that are the non-filterable components of blood. These then leave the glomerulus through the efferent arteriole, which becomes capillaries meant for kidney\u2013oxygen exchange and reabsorption before becoming venous circulation. The negatively charged podocytes will impede the filtration of negatively charged particles as well (such as albumins). The Mechanisms of Filtration The process by which glomerular filtration occurs is called renal ultrafiltration. The force of hydrostatic pressure in the glomerulus (the force of pressure exerted from the pressure of the blood vessel itself) is the driving force that pushes filtrate out of the capillaries and into the slits in the nephron. Osmotic pressure (the pulling force exerted by the albumins) works against the greater force of hydrostatic pressure, and the difference between the two determines the effective pressure of the glomerulus that determines the force by which molecules are filtered. These factors will influence the glomerular filtration rate, along with a few other factors.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The glomerular filtration barrier consists of :- Endothelium of the capillary Basement membrane:- Lamina densa - electron-dense layer. It contains type IV collagen. Lamina rara interna - contains glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate which has a negative charge.

Bicarbonate: Bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) are indeed reabsorbed in the renal tubules as part of maintaining the body's acid-base balance. However, bicarbonate reabsorption is not maximally reabsorbed as glucose. Glucose reabsorption is essential to prevent the loss of this valuable energy source, and the renal tubules are highly efficient at reclaiming almost all the filtered glucose. Option: C. Chloride: Chloride ions (Cl-) are passively reabsorbed throughout the renal tubules, especially in response to the active reabsorption of sodium (Na+). Chloride reabsorption is not maximally regulated like glucose. The primary focus of chloride handling in the kidneys is to maintain electrical neutrality and water balance in the body. Option: D. Potassium: Potassium ions (K+) are actively secreted and reabsorbed in various parts of the renal tubules to regulate potassium levels in the blood. While potassium reabsorption is important for maintaining electrolyte balance, it is not maximally reabsorbed like glucose. The regulation of potassium is more tightly controlled by factors like aldosterone and changes in dietary intake.</p>\n<p></p>",

Duodenum: The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine, located just after the stomach. It plays a crucial role in the digestion process as it receives partially digested food from the stomach and mixes it with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver. The duodenum exhibits rhythmic contractions as part of its digestive function, but these contractions are generally more frequent and rhythmic compared to the stomach. Option: B. Ileum : The ileum is the last part of the small intestine, following the jejunum. It is involved in further digestion and absorption of nutrients from the partially digested food that enters from the jejunum. The rhythmic contractions in the ileum are also relatively frequent, as they facilitate the movement of chyme (partially digested food) through the small intestine. Option: C. Jejunum: The jejunum is the middle part of the small intestine, situated between the duodenum and the ileum. Like the duodenum and ileum, the jejunum exhibits rhythmic contractions to help with digestion and absorption of nutrients. These contractions are generally more frequent and rhythmic compared to the stomach.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The Basal electrical rhythm (BER) also called slow-wave, is a rhythmic fluctuation of membrane potential in the gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It is initiated by the interstitial cells of Cajal. The membrane potential fluctuates between -65m and -45mV.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>0.8 The respiratory quotient is 0.8. Respiratory Quotient is the ratio of carbon dioxide production to oxygen utilization. In the given question, the CO2 production is 200 ml/min, while the O2 consumption is 250 ml/min. Therefore, Respiratory quotient = 200/250 = 0.8 The respiratory quotient (RQ) is used for determining the metabolic utilization of various foods. When carbohydrates are metabolized with one molecule of oxygen, one carbon dioxide molecule is released. Therefore, the RQ of carbohydrates = 1. When fats are oxidized, for every 100 molecules of oxygen consumed, 70 molecules of CO2 are released. Thus, the RQ of fats is 0.70. The respiratory quotient for proteins is 0.80.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>17 per sec Tetanizing frequency = 1/contraction period, Where the contraction period is the time taken from latent period to maximum force of contraction. In the given diagram, the time tracer was taken using a 100Hz tuning fork. Which means the tracer recorded 100 waves per second below the twitch graph. Therefore, the duration of each wave in time tracer = 0.01 seconds. Between the point B (end of latent period) to point C (maximum force of contraction), there are 6 waves. Hence the duration of contraction = 6 x 0.01 = 0.06 seconds. Thus, Tetanizing frequency = 100/6 = 16.66/sec= ~ 17/sec</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Figure shows the principles of frequency summation and tetanization. To the left are displayed individual twitch contractions occurring one after another at low frequency of stimulation. Then, as the frequency increases, there comes a point where each new contraction occurs before the preceding one is over. As a result, the second contraction is added partially to the first, so that the total strength of contraction rises progressively with increasing frequency. When the frequency reaches a critical level, the successive contractions eventually become so rapid that they fuse together, and the whole muscle contraction appears to be completely smooth and continuous, as shown in the figure. This is called tetanization. At a slightly higher frequency, the strength of contraction reaches its maximum, so that any addi-tional increase in frequency beyond that point has no further effect in increasing contractile force. This occurs because enough calcium ions are maintained in the muscle sarcoplasm, even between action potentials, so that full contractile state is sustained without allowing any relaxation between the action potentials.</p>\n<p></p>",
