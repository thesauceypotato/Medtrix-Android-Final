      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. B. CO2 embolism</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 In the scenario described, a sudden decrease in end-tidal CO2 (etCO2) to 8 mm Hg, along with a drop in blood pressure (BP) to 80/50 mm Hg and oxygen saturation (SpO2) to 90%, but with normal peak airway pressure (18 mm Hg), strongly suggests a CO2 embolism. During laparoscopic procedures, CO2 is used for insufflation to create a pneumoperitoneum, which can occasionally enter a blood vessel and cause a CO2 embolism. This event leads to a rapid decrease in etCO2 due to reduced return of CO2 to the lungs, hypoxemia, and cardiovascular collapse. The normal peak airway pressures help differentiate it from other causes of acute respiratory distress.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Pneumothorax : A pneumothorax, or collapsed lung, could occur due to barotrauma from mechanical ventilation or surgical complications. However, it typically causes an increase in peak airway pressures due to increased resistance to ventilation. The absence of increased peak airway pressures makes pneumothorax less likely in this case.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Pneumothorax</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Endobronchial Intubation : Endobronchial intubation occurs when the endotracheal tube is inserted too far and intubates one of the main bronchi, typically the right main bronchus. This can lead to hypoventilation of one lung, causing a decrease in etCO2 and SpO2. However, peak airway pressures might be higher due to one-lung ventilation, which was not observed here.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Endobronchial Intubation</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Bronchospasm : Bronchospasm involves the constriction of the muscles in the walls of the bronchioles, leading to narrowed airways. This would usually present with an increase in peak airway pressures due to the narrowed airways, which is not consistent with the normal peak airway pressures reported in this scenario.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Bronchospasm</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 During laparoscopic surgery, the sudden onset of hypotension, hypoxemia, and a significant decrease in etCO2 with normal peak airway pressures suggests a CO2 embolism, a rare but potentially life-threatening complication.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
