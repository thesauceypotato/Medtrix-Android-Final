Desmopressin acetate : Desmopressin acetate, a synthetic form of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is another treatment option for primary nocturnal enuresis , particularly for children who do not respond to behavioral interventions such as enuresis alarms or who need additional help in achieving dry nights .
