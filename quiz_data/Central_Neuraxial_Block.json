Moreover, the blockade of cardioaccelerator fibers (T1-T4) can further aggravate bradycardia. Blockage of the adrenal can decrease the supply of catecholamines further worsening the hypotension.

Post-dural puncture headache is reported more in females as compared to males, particularly young females. Again, the exact reason for this discrepancy is not known however increased sensitivity in females could have been the reason. In pregnancy, increased intraabdominal pressure can compress the IVC leading to engorgement of epidural veins. Engorgement of these veins can push the dura medially, increasing the CSF pressure. Therefore, due to increased CSF pressure post dural puncture headache is more during pregnancy.</p>\n<p></p>",
