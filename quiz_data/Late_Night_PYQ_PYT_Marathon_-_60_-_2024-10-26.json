C) Rapid release of calcium from bones and increased calcium reabsorption in kidneys:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The educational objective here is to understand the role of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in regulating calcium levels in the blood and the mechanisms by which it accomplishes this task.</li><li>\u27a4 Role of PTH in Calcium Regulation: PTH is a hormone produced by the parathyroid glands, which are small glands located in the neck. Its primary function is to regulate calcium homeostasis in the body, ensuring that blood calcium levels remain within a narrow and critical range. Increase in Blood Calcium: PTH increases blood calcium levels by stimulating various physiological processes: Stimulation of Osteoclasts: PTH activates osteoclasts, specialized bone cells responsible for breaking down bone tissue. This results in the release of calcium from the bones into the bloodstream. Enhanced Calcium Reabsorption: PTH enhances the reabsorption of calcium by the kidneys. This means that less calcium is excreted in urine, conserving it for use in the body. Activation of Vitamin D: PTH indirectly stimulates the production of active vitamin D (calcitriol) in the kidneys. Calcitriol helps increase calcium absorption from the digestive tract, further contributing to higher blood calcium levels. Negative Feedback Loop: The regulation of PTH secretion is tightly controlled by a negative feedback loop. When blood calcium levels drop below the normal range, the parathyroid glands release PTH, which acts to raise calcium levels. Once calcium levels return to normal, PTH secretion decreases, preventing excess calcium in the blood.</li><li>\u27a4 Role of PTH in Calcium Regulation: PTH is a hormone produced by the parathyroid glands, which are small glands located in the neck.

In cases of brachial artery injury caused by trauma, such as a stab wound, repairing the artery with a vein graft allows for a tension-free anastomosis , which is essential for restoring proper blood flow. The great saphenous vein is typically harvested from the patient's leg (usually the uninjured leg) and is used to bypass or replace the damaged section of the brachial artery.
