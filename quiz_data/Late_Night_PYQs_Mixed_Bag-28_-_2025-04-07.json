Rigidity occurs in all the muscles of the body</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 Decerebrate rigidity is the rigid extension of all the limbs due to decerebration. This type of rigidity is well pronounced in the extensor muscles. The term decerebrate rigidity was coined by Sherrington in 1897.</li><li>\u2022 Reason for decerebrate rigidity:</li><li>\u2022 Reason for decerebrate rigidity:</li><li>\u2022 Release of the centers, situated below the section, from higher inhibitory controls. The inhibitory area is 4S. It is situated in the motor cortex of cerebrum, just anterior to area 4 and behind area 6. In this area, Betz cells are absent. From here, the fibers are projected to spinal cord via reticular formation. So, in decerebration the discharge from neurons of area 4S cannot reach spinal motor neurons. This leads to exaggeration of spinal motor neurons resulting in rigidity. Decerebrate rigidity is also produced by stopping the blood flow to the forebrain. It is done by occlusion of the common carotid artery and the basilar artery at the center of the pons.</li><li>\u2022 Release of the centers, situated below the section, from higher inhibitory controls.

Increase in the rate of discharge of the \u03b3 efferent neuron : Correct as part of the characterization of decerebrate rigidity. The increased discharge rate of the \u03b3 efferent neurons enhances the muscle spindle responses, contributing to increased muscle tone.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Increase in the rate of discharge of the \u03b3 efferent neuron</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

Increased excitability of the motor neuron pool</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Decerebration produces no phenomenon akin to spinal shock : Correct, unlike spinal shock, which involves a temporary reduction or loss of reflex activity below the level of a spinal cord injury, decerebration does not produce a similar transient reduction in reflexes.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
