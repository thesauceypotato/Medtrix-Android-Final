Fluid requirement is calculated under following: The daily fluid requirements in children: Up to 10kg 100ml/kg 10-20kg 50ml/kg >20kg = 20ml/kg Deficit replacement or rehydration therapy is calculated as: 75ml kg body weight (wt. 75) of ORS, to be given over 4 hours. If ORS cannot be taken orally, then nasogastric tube can be used. Maintenance fluid therapy to replace losses. This phase begins when signs of dehydration disappears, usually within 4hours. ORS should be administered to a maximum of 10ml/kg per stool. Breastfeeding and semisolid food are continued after replacement of deficit. PLAN C For severe dehydration.

Shigella dysenteriae refers to the presence of grossly visible blood in the stools and is a consequence of colon infection by either bacteria like shigella, E-coli or amoeba. Bacillary dysentery is more common in children than amebic dysentery. A child with bacillary dysentery presents with fever and diarrhoea. The illness is complicated by dehydration, dyselectrolytemia, HUS, toxic megacolon, perforation and rectal prolapse. Options B . In Escherichia coli, enteroinvasive E-coli (EIEC) and enterohaemorrhagic E-coli (EHEC) can cause dysentery. EHEC may also cause the hemolytic uremic syndrome. pathogenic E-coli, especially the enteroaggregative and enteroadherent types, results in malabsorption by causing persistent infection. Options D. Adenovirus are common viruses that typically cause flu-like illness & mild cold. It causes acute respiratory diseases, pneumonia, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis & occasionally gastroenteritis. In infants, pharyngitis & pharyngeal-conjunctival fever are common.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>2 & 3 The essential micronutrients are Zinc & vitamin A(2 & 3). Both of these micronutrients are essential for maintaining mucosal immunity. Vitamin A deficiency increases mortality from diarrhoea, measles, and malaria, while Zinc deficiency increases mortality from diarrhoea, pneumonia, and malaria. A single oral dose of vitamin A should be given routinely, at 2,00,000IU for children > 12 months or 100,000IU for children 6-12 months. Zinc is recommended to be supplemented as sulfate, acetate or gluconate formulation at 20mg of elemental zinc per day for children > 6 months for 14 days. Zinc supplementation is now a part of the standard care along with ORS in children with acute diarrhoea. Magnesium and Pottasium supplementation is provided to severely malnourished infants & children. Magnesium is given by IM route at 0.2ml/kg/dose of 50% magnesium sulfate twice a day for 2-3 days. Pottasium is supplemented orally at 5-6meq/kg/day or as part of IV infusions during the initial stabilisation phase. Supplemental multivitamins and minerals, at about twice the RDA, should be given daily to all children for at least 2-4 weeks. Iron supplements should be introduced only after the diarrhoea has ceased. Recent studies also indicate the usefulness of folic acid in preventing diarrhoea.</p>\n<p></p>",
