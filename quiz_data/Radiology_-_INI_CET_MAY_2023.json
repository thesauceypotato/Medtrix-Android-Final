      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Phyrigian cap gallbladder The ultrasound examination of the gallbladder shows a phrygian cap . It is a normal anatomical variant.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Phrygian cap refers to an anatomical variant of the gallbladder, where the fundus of the gallbladder folds on itself, or is separated from the body by a partial or complete septum. A true septum is uncommon and is usually an apparent septum due to the gallbladder wall folding. It is an incidental finding that may be seen on CT, MRI, or ultrasound. It causes no symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option B . Gall bladder polyp - Gallbladder polyps are growths or lesions resembling growths (polypoid lesions) in the wall of the gallbladder. True polyps are abnormal accumulations of mucous membrane tissue that would normally be shed by the body. Option C. Gall bladder stone -Gallstone disease refers to the condition where gallstones are either in the gallbladder or common bile duct. The presence of stones in the gallbladder is referred to as cholelithiasis Option D. Emphysematous gallbladde r: Acute inflammatory processes in the biliary system (cholecystitis with or without stones formation), which create obstacles for the excretion of bile , leading to stagnation and increased growth of bacterial flora; tumor processes, squeezing the bile duct, preventing the excretion of bile.</p>\n<p></p>",

Only acromioclavicular ligament is the wrong statement as there is a gap between the clavicle and the acromion suggesting injury to both acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligament. Option: C.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Spina bifida Spina bifida is a spine disorder that is usually noticeable at birth. It\u2019s an example of a neural tube defect. It can occur anywhere along the spine if the neural tube fails to shut completely. When the neural tube fails to close completely,the backbone that protects the spinal cord fails to form and close properly. This frequently results in spinal cord nerve injuries. Banana sign on USG is associated with spina bifida</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The banana sign is an abnormal curvature of the cerebellum noted on ultrasound imaging in a fetus with Arnold-Chiari malformation, spina bifida and other neural tube defects. Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spine and spinal cord don't form properly. It's a type of neural tube defect. The neural tube is the structure in a developing embryo that eventually becomes the baby's brain, spinal cord and the tissues that enclose them. Lemon sign occurs due to overlapping of the frontal bones due to the posterior shift of intracranial contents as shown below.</p>\n<p><strong>:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B. Omphalocele , There are two main types of abdominal wall defects : omphalocele and gastroschisis. Omphalocele is an opening in the center of the abdominal wall where the umbilical cord meets the abdomen. Organs (typically the intestines, stomach, and liver) protrude through the opening into the umbilical cord and are covered by the same protective membrane Option: C. Gastroschisis , is a birth defect in which the baby's intestines extend outside of the abdomen through a hole next to the belly The size of the hole is variable, and other organs including the stomach and liver may also occur outside the baby's body Option: D. Down syndrome , Trisomy 21, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. It is usually associated with developmental delays, mild to moderate intellectual disability, and characteristic physical features.</p>\n<p></p>",

A USG guided biopsy is a procedure in which ultrasound imaging is used to precisely guide the needle during a biopsy,helping to ensure accurate sampling of suspicious areas. Option D. In young females with dense breasts. This statement is an advantage of USG. Young females with dense breast tissue often face challenges with mammography due to overlapping density that can obscure small abnormalities.</p>\n<p></p>",
