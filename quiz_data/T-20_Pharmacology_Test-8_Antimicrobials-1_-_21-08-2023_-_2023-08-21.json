Cefotaxime is more active against beta-lactamase producing strains of H. influenzae.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 One of the main reasons cefotaxime is preferred over ampicillin in the treatment of H. influenzae meningitis is due to its activity against beta-lactamase producing strains. Many strains of H. influenzae produce beta-lactamase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring of ampicillin, rendering it ineffective. Cefotaxime, being a third-generation cephalosporin, is resistant to this enzyme and can effectively treat beta-lactamase producing strains of H. influenzae. Cefotaxime is primarily given intravenously or intramuscularly, not orally. Ampicillin can be given both orally and parenterally. Both cefotaxime and ampicillin target penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). However, the resistance of H. influenzae to ampicillin is primarily due to the production of beta-lactamase, not the alteration of PBPs. Both cefotaxime and ampicillin are bactericidal agents. They kill bacteria by inhibiting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall.</li><li>\u2022 One of the main reasons cefotaxime is preferred over ampicillin in the treatment of H. influenzae meningitis is due to its activity against beta-lactamase producing strains.

This means it actively kills bacteria rather than merely inhibiting their growth. It has the advantage of high oral bioavailability: Vancomycin has poor oral bioavailability. When given orally, it doesn't absorb well from the gastrointestinal tract, so its oral form is mainly used to treat C. difficile colitis. For systemic infections, it's typically given intravenously. Staphylococcal enterocolitis occurs commonly with its use: Staphylococcal enterocolitis isn't a common association with vancomycin use. However, antibiotics, including vancomycin, can be associated with antibiotic-induced diarrhea or colitis, most famously caused by Clostridium difficile. It is not susceptible to penicillinases: This is true. Vancomycin's action is distinct from beta-lactams. It binds to the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus of the cell wall precursor units, preventing cell wall synthesis. As a result, penicillinases, which break down the beta-lactam ring in penicillins, don't affect vancomycin.</li><li>\u2022 It is bacteriostatic: Vancomycin is primarily bactericidal.
