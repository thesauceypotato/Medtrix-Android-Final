Fatal period  is 2-3  hours  in narcotic  form and  12  hours  \u2013 2 days  in  gastrointestinal  form. Arsenic poisoning may be  acute  or chronic. Acute arsenic poisoning : Present in two  ways Gastrointestinal type: Common form  and  resembles  bacterial  gastroenteritis  . There is garlic odor with hemorrhagic  gastroenteritis  and  necrosis of  intestinal  mucosa . Dehydration  may  cause acute  circulatory  collapse, with hypotension,  oliguria and  acute tubular  necrosis  (ATN). Fulminant narcotic  form : Large  dose of arsenic is  rapidly  absorbed without producing  GI    These are  giddiness,  headache,  myalgia, formication,  vertigo  and  death  in  2-3  hours. Chronic arsenic  poisoning  has  four  stages: First stage  (nutritional  and gastrointestinal  disturbances) : The earliest  sign  is  gradual  emaciation . There is  loss  of appetite,  nausea  and  intermittent  vomiting  and Second stage  (catarrhal  changes) : Resembles common  cold, i.e. conjunctivitis, running nose and eyes, coughing etc. Third stage  (skin rash)  : Classical  \u2018raindrop pigmentation\u2019 i.e.  patchy  brown  pigmentation of skin . Hyperkeratosis  of palms  and soles . White  transverse  bands crossing  the  nails, known  as Mee\u2019s  line , indicative of  periods  of  arrested growth  due  to  interference  with normal  Alopecia and exfoliative  dermatitis. Fourth stage (nervous  disturbance) : Sensory  and  motor polyneuropathy with painful paresthesia of  hands  and feet and  muscle  Liver and  kidney damage  and bone  marrow  suppression causing  anemia  and other  cytopenias. Chronic arsenic exposure  can  also  cause B lack  foot  disease - a form  of  peripheral  vascular  disease, causing gangrene  of lower Arsenic is  carcinogenic and can cause Skin carcinomas, Bladder and Lung carcinomas and Bowen disease Diagnosis : Excretion of > 100 mg of arsenic  in  24  hours  urine</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B : Occupational exposure may cause respiratory irritation , pneumoconiosis, antimony spots on the skin and gastrointestinal symptoms Option C : Barium poisoning causes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea . lt causes cramps and stiffness of the muscles, dilation of the pupil, paralysis of the tongue and larynx, and vertigo.
