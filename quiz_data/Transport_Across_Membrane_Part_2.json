      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Calmodulin Calmodulin is a Ca2+-binding protein ubiquitous in the eukaryotes.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>It has no intrinsic enzymatic activity, but it regulates a wide spectrum of enzymes that control many basic cellular processes, ranging from the metabolism of cyclic nucleotides, Ca2+, and glycogen to contractile activity and stimulus-secretion coupling. Smooth muscle cells contain large amounts of this regulatory protein. Although this protein is similar to troponin, it is different in the manner in which it initiates contraction. Calmodulin initiates contraction by activating the myosin cross-bridges. This activation and subsequent Contraction occur in the following sequence:- Calcium concentration in the cytosolic fluid of the smooth muscle increases as a result of the influx of calcium from the extracellular fluid through calcium channels and/or release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium ions bind reversibly with calmodulin. The calmodulin-calcium complex then joins with and activates myosin light chain kinase, a phosphorylating enzyme.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect Option: - Option: A . Cyclins are eukaryotic proteins that play an active role in controlling nuclear cell division cycles. , and regulate cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). Option: C . Membrane collagenous proteins function both as cell surface receptors and as soluble extracellular molecules because their ectodomains are released from the cell surface by shedding. Option: D . Kinesins are biological motor proteins that are ATP-dependent and function to assist cells with the transport of molecules along microtubules.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Increasing lipid solubility of the membrane Diffusion of Lipid-Soluble Substances through the Lipid Bilayer. An important factor that determines how rapidly a substance diffuses through the lipid bilayer is the lipid solubility of the substance.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>For instance, the lipid solubility of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and alcohols are high, and all these substances can dissolve directly in the lipid bilayer and diffuse through the cell membrane in the same manner that diffusion of water solutes occurs in a watery solution. The rate of diffusion of each of these substances through the membrane is directly proportional to its lipid solubility.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect Option: - Option: B. The rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to the size of the molecules. This means that the smaller the size of the molecule, the higher is the rate of diffusion. Option: C. Increased surface area increases the rate of diffusion, whereas a thicker membrane reduces it.</p>\n<p></p>",
