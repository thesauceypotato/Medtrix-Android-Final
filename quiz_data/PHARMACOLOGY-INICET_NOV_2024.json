Triclabendazole sulfoxide is the metabolite active against F. hepatica The liver fluke F. hepatica is resistant to praziquantel and should be treated with triclabendazole.

Due to trauma if the sympathetic nervous system will not be able to control the cardiovascular system, that would lead to vasodilation that can lead to decrease in diastolic BP.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Effects of stimulation of the sympathetic division: The effect of sympathetic stimulation is an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, mobilization of energy stores, and increase in blood flow to skeletal muscles and the heart while diverting flow from the skin and internal organs. Sympathetic stimulation results in dilation of the pupils and bronchioles . It also reduces GI motility and affects function of the bladder and sexual organs Activation of the sympathetic system causes an increase in heart rate, increase in blood pressure, reduction or thickening of fluid secretions, and constriction of blood vessels. Therefore, inhibition of the sympathetic system should theoretically cause a reduction in heart rate, decrease in blood pressure, increase in fluid secretions, and relaxation of blood vessels.
