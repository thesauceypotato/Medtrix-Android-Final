However, the following factors and hypotheses have been forwarded: The prevalence varies with race and ethnic origin. Faulty nutrition caused by inadequate protein intake and animal fat could partly explain its prevalence in Oriental Countries. Low dietary intake of carotene is associated with increased risk.

PROPHYLACTIC CHEMOTHERAPY: About 80 Percent of patients undergo spontaneous remission. Sensitive b-hCG assay can identify the rest that develops a Moreover, the drugs used are toxic. These drugs in young females increase the risk of premature ovarian failure and menopause. So it is not appropriate to treat all patients as a routine prophylactically. However, it is used with advantages in the following circumstances: If the hCG level fails to become normal by the stipulated time (10\u201312 weeks) or there is RE elevation at 4\u20138 weeks. (STATEMNT3 ) Rising b-hCG level after reaching normal levels. (STATEMENT1) Post-evacuation hemorrhage ( presence of trophoblastic activity).

In cases where the malignant sequelae are higher as judged by the risk factors and where proper follow-up facilities are unavailable. Prophylactic chemotherapy in such patients is better than no follow-up. Prophylactic chemotherapy is helpful in high-risk women as it prevents metastasis and reduces morbidity. Regimes: Methotrexate, 1 mg/kg/day IV or IM, is given on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 with folinic acid 0.1 mg/kg IM on days 2, 4, 6, and 8. It is to be repeated every seven days.

Asymptomatic patients with a normal chest X-ray are unlikely to have brain or other visceral metastasis.

In partial hydatidiform mole, the affection of the chorionic villi is focal. There is a fetus or at least an amniotic sac. Point 2. The karyotype is triploid, either 69XXY or 69XYY, with one maternal but usually two paternal haploid chromosomes. Microscopic examination of the dilated chorionic villi shows predominant hyperplasia of the syncytiotrophoblast and the presence of fetal blood vessels with fetal red blood cells. The fetus, if present, dies in the early first trimester. Rarely, the baby may be born, which is growth retarded with multisystem abnormalities. Points 3 and 4. Post-termination follow-up protocol should be the same as outlined in a complete mole. As the chance of malignancy is much less, the follow-up for 3\u20136 months is to be continued after the hCG level returns to normal. The clinical picture does not differ markedly from the complete mole and is too often confused with threatened or missed abortion. The hCG titer is not raised significantly. With the broader use of sonography, more and more cases are being revealed. The uterus is generally not large for dates in partial mole, and malignant potential is shallow. Once the diagnosis is made and the fetus is not alive, termination of pregnancy is to be done. Even if the fetus is active, the patient should be warned about the risks involved to the fetus if the incubation is continued.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Risk Factors for Malignant Change Patient's age \u2265 40 or < 20 years irrespective of parity Parity \u2265 3.

In low risk patients-single drug, i.e. methotrexate is given. If the patient has jaundice then actinomycin D should be given.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Monotherapy with methotrexate is preferred (not multiple agents). Option: C. The use of prophylactic chemotherapy reduces the chances of developing choriocarcinoma but does not make it nil. Option: D. Regular follow up is required</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Radiation Patients with brain metastases require whole-brain radiation therapy (3000 cGy over Ten days). Intrathecal high-dose methotrexate may be administered to prevent bleeding and tumor shrinkage. Liver metastasis: Interventional radiology (hepatic artery ligation or embolization), whole liver radiation (2000 cGy ook re com over ten days), and chemotherapy may be effective. Hepatic metastasis has a poor prognosis.</p>\n<p></p>",
