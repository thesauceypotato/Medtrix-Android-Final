      "explanation": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The question is referring to Japanese Encephalitis (JE) outbreaks, which are not uncommon in India and parts of Southeast Asia. During such outbreaks, emergency vaccination campaigns are often undertaken to control the spread of disease.</li><li>\u2022 The most commonly used vaccine in these public health campaigns in India earlier used to be Live JE SA 14-14-2 vaccine (subcutaneous). But nowadays, the inactivated (killed) Vero cell\u2013derived JE vaccine - JENVAC is used intramuscularly.</li><li>\u2022 Hence, the correct response based on updated national guidelines is:</li><li>\u2022 Killed and intramuscular.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B) Live and subcutaneous:</li><li>\u2022 Option B) Live and subcutaneous:</li><li>\u2022 While the SA 14-14-2 vaccine is a live, attenuated vaccine given subcutaneously, recent protocols for outbreak settings increasingly prefer killed vaccines like JENVAC, especially in adult populations and for mass campaigns due to ease of storage and safety. Live vaccine SA -14-14-2 is quite good during outbreaks too. But JENVAC has an edge over SA 14-14-2 because of the higher immunity levels it creates with a single dose. Hence, although previously correct, SA 14-14-2 is no longer the preferred or updated answer.</li><li>\u2022 Option C) Live and intramuscular:</li><li>\u2022 Option C) Live and intramuscular:</li><li>\u2022 Live vaccines (like SA 14-14-2) are given subcutaneously. IM route is not used for Live JE SA 14-14-2 routinely.</li><li>\u2022 Option D) Killed and subcutaneous:</li><li>\u2022 Option D) Killed and subcutaneous:</li><li>\u2022 Killed JE vaccines (like JENVAC or IXIARO) are administered intramuscularly.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 In the setting of a Japanese Encephalitis outbreak, the vaccine currently recommended and used in mass immunization campaigns in India is a killed (inactivated) vaccine administered via the intramuscular route, such as JENVAC. While older guidelines or some regions may have used the live attenuated SA 14-14-2 vaccine given subcutaneously, updated practices now favor the inactivated IM vaccine due to its broader safety profile and compatibility with adult vaccination. Always refer to the most recent national immunization guidelines when answering such public health\u2013related MCQs.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
