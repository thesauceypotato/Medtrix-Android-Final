      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>A decreased FEV1/FVC A decreased FEV1/FVC is consistent with a diagnosis of allergic bronchospasm. Allergic bronchospasm is a type of asthma triggered by an allergic reaction. It causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to difficulty breathing, coughing, and wheezing. Pulmonary function tests can be used to diagnose and monitor allergic bronchospasm.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>FEV1/FVC is the ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC). In allergic bronchospasm, the airways are narrowed, resulting in a decrease in both FEV1 and FVC. However, because FVC decreases less than FEV1, the ratio of FEV1/FVC decreases, indicating airflow limitation. Therefore, a decreased FEV1/FVC is consistent with a diagnosis of allergic bronchospasm.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- The other options listed, including an increased forced vital capacity, an increased diffusing capacity, and a decreased residual volume, are not typical findings in allergic bronchospasm.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Bronchospasm increases the resistance to airflow, which makes it more difficult to expel gas rapidly from the lung during expiration, so although both FEV1 and vital capacity decrease, the percent of gas expelled in 1 second as a function of the total amount that can be expelled (the FEV1/FVC ratio) also decreases dramatically. The obstructive disease also produces air trapping, which increases the residual volume, functional residual capacity, and total lung capacity. FEV1/FVC in disease: The ratio decreases in COPD and is used to assess the severity of the disease: 60-70%: Mild COPD 50-60%: Moderate COPD < 50%: Severe COPD If bronchodilator response to beta 2 agonists is there: means if there is >15% increase in FEV1: Points towards asthma.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>FLOW-VOLUME\n  PARAMETER Obstructive\n  lung disease Restrictive\n  lung disease RV \u2191 \u2193 FRC \u2191 \u2193 TLC \u2193\u2193 \u2193 FEV \u2193 \u2193 FVC \u2193 \u2193 FEV /FVC FEV,\n  decreased more than FVC Normal or\n  \u2191 FEV,\n  decreased proportionately to FVC</p>\n<p></p>",

If airway resistance increases by increasing airway smooth muscle tone or increasing lung compliance, then a greater expiratory effort and consequently a greater intrapleural pressure will be necessary to expel the gas from the lungs.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Increased lung elastic recoil A lung with increased elastic recoil (decreased compliance) will be harder to fill on inspiration and will tend to pull the chest wall inward on relaxation of the muscles of breathing . Thus, both TLC and FRC will be decreased. Because airway radius is normal or even increased, FEV1 normalized to FVC will be normal or increased even though FVC will be reduced. Decreased muscle strength could cause a decrease in TLC, but it would not alter FRC.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Changes in FRC point toward changes in lung and chest wall structure such as those caused by pulmonary fibrosis.
