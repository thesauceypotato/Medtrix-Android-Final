      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Esophageal Varices The endoscopic image shows esophageal varices</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Esophageal varices are dilated submucosal distal esophageal veins connecting the portal and systemic circulations . They form due to portal hypertension, which commonly is a result of cirrhosis, resistance to portal blood flow, and increased portal venous blood inflow. Normal portal pressure is between 5-10 mmHg but in the presence of portal obstruction, the pressure may be as high as 15-20 mmHg Management of Active bleeding: Intravenous (IV) access, hemodynamic resuscitation Overtransfusion increases portal pressure and increases rebleeding risk Treat coagulopathy as necessary. Fresh frozen plasma may increase blood volume and increase rebleeding risk Monitor mental status. Avoid sedation, nephrotoxic drugs, and beta - blockers acutely. IV octreotide to lower portal venous pressure as adjuvant to endoscopic management. IV bolus of 50 micrograms followed by a drip of 50 micrograms/hr. Terlipressin (alternative): 2 mg q4h IV for 24 to 48 hours, then 1 mg q4h Erythromycin 250 mg IV 30 to 120 minutes before endoscopy. Urgent upper GI endoscopy for diagnosis and treatment If no contraindication, start beta-blocker (nitrates are an alternative) Variceal band ligation is preferred to sclerotherapy for bleeding varices and for non-bleeding medium-to-large varices to decrease bleeding risk. Prevent recurrence of acute bleeding: Vasoconstrictors: terlipressin, octreotide (reduce portal pressure) Endoscopic band ligation (EBL) : if bleeding recurs/portal pressure measurement shows portal pressure remains greater than 12 mmHg TIPS : Second-line therapy if the above methods fail.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Gastric ulcer- discrete mucosal lesion with a punched-out smooth ulcer base. The everted margins are suggestive of malignant ulcer. Most gastric ulcers tend to occur at the junction of the body and antrum, along the lesser curvature. Option: C. Candida is normally found in the throat but can become pathogenic and produce esophagitis in a compromised host. Endoscopy with biopsy is the most useful for diagnosis. Candida has a characteristic appearance of white plaques or exudate with friability. Treatment: oral fluconazole 400 mg on first day followed by 200 mg daily for 14 to 21 days. Option: D. Barrett\u2019s oesophagus is a metaplastic change in the lining mucosa of the oesophagus in response to chronic gastro-oesophageal Reflux. The hallmark of \u2018specialised\u2019 Barrett\u2019s epithelium is the presence of mucus-secreting goblet cells (intestinal metaplasia)</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA MANAGEMENT OF VARICEAL BLEEDING</p>\n<p></p>",

Clinical Presentation: Watery diarrhea, often foul-smelling. Abdominal pain and cramping. Pseudomembranes (yellow-white plaques) visible on colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Risk Factors: Antibiotic use, especially broad-spectrum antibiotics. Recent hospitalization or healthcare exposure. Advanced age. Immunocompromised patients. Diagnosis Stool tests to detect C. difficile toxins, such as toxin A and toxin B. Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy to visualize pseudomembranes. Treatment : Discontinuation of the inciting antibiotics if possible. Antibiotic therapy: First-line: Oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin for severe cases.
