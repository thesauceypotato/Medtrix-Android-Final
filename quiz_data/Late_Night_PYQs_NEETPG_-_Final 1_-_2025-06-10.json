This specific location is the area of maximum vibration of the cord during phonation, making it subject to maximum trauma. They develop due to vocal abuse or misuse when a person speaks in unnatural low tones for prolonged periods or at high intensities.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Laser therapy is the treatment of choice: This is incorrect. Early cases of vocal nodules are treated conservatively through voice rest and speech therapy, especially in children. Surgery is only required for large nodules or nodules of long standing in adults. Even when surgery is indicated, it can be performed either with cold instruments or laser - neither being designated as the \"treatment of choice.\"</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Laser therapy is the treatment of choice:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Requires excision as it is potentially malignant: This is incorrect. Singer's nodules are non-neoplastic, benign lesions that form due to trauma from vocal abuse. They have no malignant potential. They develop through a process of submucosal edema and hemorrhage that undergoes hyalinization and fibrosis.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Requires excision as it is potentially malignant:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Most common symptom is pain: This is incorrect. Hoarseness is the most common complaint in patients with vocal nodules.

Unlike decubitus ulcers, they result from venous hypertension rather than direct pressure.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Venous ulcer</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Arterial ulcer - Arterial (ischemic) ulcers occur at distal locations like toes and dorsum of foot. They are characteristically deep, severely painful, and associated with signs of peripheral vascular disease including brittle nails, sparse hair, and intermittent claudication. They stem from inadequate arterial perfusion rather than external pressure.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Arterial ulcer</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Neuropathic ulcer - Neuropathic ulcers typically form on weight-bearing areas of the foot with characteristic \"punched out\" edges and surrounding callosity. They develop due to sensory, motor, and autonomic neuropathy (commonly in diabetic patients) rather than from external pressure. The painless nature of these ulcers distinguishes them from decubitus ulcers.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.
