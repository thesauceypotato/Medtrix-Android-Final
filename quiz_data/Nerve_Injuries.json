Common peroneal nerve: The common peroneal nerve is primarily responsible for innervating the muscles of the lower leg and foot, as well as providing sensory innervation to parts of the leg and foot. It does not get directly affected during the McRobert\u2019s procedure. However, if there were complications during childbirth, such as prolonged pressure on the lower leg or foot, there could be indirect effects on the common peroneal nerve. For example, prolonged pressure or stretching of the leg during childbirth could potentially result in nerve compression or injury. However, compared to the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh, the common peroneal nerve is less directly involved in the maneuver described in the question.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Common peroneal nerve:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Obturator nerve: The obturator nerve provides sensory and motor innervation to the muscles of the medial thigh and the skin of the inner thigh. While the obturator nerve does pass through the pelvic region and could theoretically be affected by pressure or stretching during the McRobert\u2019s procedure, it is less likely to be directly involved compared to the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh. The McRobert\u2019s procedure primarily involves hyperflexion of the thigh over the abdomen, which puts more direct pressure on nerves in the anterior and lateral aspects of the thigh rather than those in the medial aspect.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Obturator nerve:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Lumbosacral trunk: The lumbosacral trunk is formed by the merging of the fifth lumbar nerve root and the first sacral nerve root. It contributes to the formation of the sciatic nerve and does not directly supply the muscles or skin of the thigh. Therefore, it is unlikely to be directly affected during the McRobert\u2019s procedure.

Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) includes peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and venous disease. PAD is a chronic progressive atherosclerotic disease leading to partial or total peripheral vascular occlusion. PAD typically affects the abdominal aorta, iliac arteries, lower limbs, and occasionally the upper extremities. There is atypical pain characterized by pain unrelated to physical activity, that occurs both at rest and exertion, and lasting longer than 10 minutes after exercise cessation. Intermittent claudication is the most classic symptom of PAD, characterized by an exercise-induced cramping sensation with associated fatigue, weakness, and or pressure. Symptoms are exacerbated by leg elevation and relieved by placing the limb in a dependent position. Paresthesias, lower extremity weakness, stiffness, and cool extremities may also be present.</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Peripheral vascular disease</li><li>\u2022 Option B: Tarsal coalition . Tarsal coalition is the complete or partial union between two or more bones in the midfoot and hindfoot. It is a developmental fusion and not that acquired secondary to rheumatoid arthritis, trauma or post-surgery. It can present as osseous (synostosis), fibrous (syndesmosis), or cartilaginous (synchondrosis) connections between the tarsal bones. Adolescents present with the insidious onset of hind foot pain with or without recurrent ankle sprains. Some complain of stiffness in the hind foot. The pain is usually described as coming from the lateral side of the hind foot and ankle. A twisting injury may stretch, tear, or disrupt the coalition, causing the coalition to become painful.</li><li>\u2022 Option B: Tarsal coalition</li><li>\u2022 Option D: Plantar fibromatosis . Plantar fibromatosis is a benign fibroblastic, connective tissue proliferative disorder of the superficial plantar aponeurosis of the foot. Onset is slow, and patients usually present after the disease becomes locally aggressive, causing pain and swelling in the medial non-weight bearing plantar surface of the feet. The classic presentation is that of a slow-growing, painless nodule in the medial or central plantar aponeurosis of the foot. Smaller nodules can present as local pressure points. Locally invasive nodules can lead to pain and swelling, and trouble with ambulation. Patients commonly present after experiencing increased pain in the plantar surface of the foot after long walks. Activities such as long walks, prolonged standing, and walking barefoot can exacerbate the symptoms.</li><li>\u2022 Option D: Plantar fibromatosis</li><li>\u2022 Educational objective:</li><li>\u2022 Educational objective:</li><li>\u2022 Three most common causes of pain in plantar aspect of foot are plantar fasciitis, tarsal tunnel syndrome, and posterior tibial tendinopathy.

Polymyositis, a relatively uncommon autoimmune disorder that develops due to abnormal activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8 cells) and macrophages against muscular antigens that result in rhabdomyolysis and ultimately presents as a proximal myopathy. Polymyositis is characterized by symmetrical proximal muscle weakness due to the involvement of endomysial layers of skeletal muscles versus dermatomyositis, which involves the perimysial layers of muscles along with dermatological presentations. Polymyositis develops over the months. Polymyositis rarely presents in childhood and usually affects people above the age of 20 years. The hallmark of polymyositis is a progressive disease with symmetric involvement of shoulder and pelvic girdle muscles and neck flexors. Hip extensors can be involved making it difficult for patients to climb stairs. Patients may complain of the inability of overhead abduction or to get up from the seated position. Disease progression to distal muscles can result in abnormal fine movements such as writing and playing musical instruments. Constitutional symptoms include low-grade fever, anorexia, arthralgia, and weight loss. Polymyositis can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD), especially in anti-Jo-1 positive patients, presenting as shortness of breath and dry cough. Other presenting complaints are chest tightness and exertional dyspnea due to restrictive cardiomyopathy, constipation, or bloating due to gastrointestinal involvement and tightening and discoloration of fingers due to Raynaud phenomenon.</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Polymyositis</li><li>\u2022 Option B: Muscular dystrophy . It is a hereditary disorder that leads to progressive and generalized disease of the muscle due to inadequate or missing glycoproteins in the muscle cell plasma membrane. Gracilis, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and sartorius muscles can be affected. Feet can exhibit an equinovarus deformity. The pelvis can tilt. There may be contractures throughout the body. Spinal deformities may produce lordosis or scoliosis. The eye can exhibit cataracts and bilateral ptosis. Onset usually occurs in the third to fourth decades. There is accelerated deterioration near the age of onset. Parents may present with a concern that their child is not walking as other children their age. There is massive calf muscles and proximal lower limb muscle weakness. The individuals utilize their arms and hands to aid in rising from sitting. Other complaints can involve a history of delayed ambulation, toe walking, calf hypertrophy, and proximal hip girdle muscle instability. There can be asymptomatic elevation of serum creatine kinase, exertion intolerance, dilated cardiomyopathy, malignant hyperthermia, quadriceps myopathy, language delay, and Turner syndrome (Duchenne in X chromosome monozygotic females). Since the inheritance can be X-linked, the majority of patients are male. Scoliosis and sustained alveolar hypoventilation can cause severe problems.</li><li>\u2022 Option B: Muscular dystrophy</li><li>\u2022 Option D: Neuropathy . Neuropathy occurs when nerve damage leads to pain, weakness, numbness or tingling in one or more parts of body. It may be because of disease, infection, injury, medicines, or long-term alcohol abuse.

CT scans can be useful in identifying bony abnormalities such as cervical ribs, bony spurs, or other anatomical variations that may contribute to thoracic outlet syndrome.

DSA provides dynamic, real-time images of blood flow and can help identify areas of vascular compression or obstruction. While DSA can be valuable in cases where vascular involvement is suspected, it is an invasive procedure associated with potential risks such as allergic reactions to contrast dye, blood vessel injury, or infection.

Performing tendon transfer operation just two months after the onset of polio paralysis is very early in the course of the condition. At this stage, the child's muscles and nervous system may still be undergoing significant changes and adaptation following the acute phase of polio. The muscles affected by paralysis may not have stabilized, and there may still be potential for spontaneous recovery or improvement in muscle function. Additionally, operating too early may risk surgical complications or suboptimal outcomes due to the lack of adequate time for assessment and planning. Therefore, 2 months is unlikely to be the correct timing for tendon transfer operation in a child with polio paralysis.</li><li>\u2022 Option A: 2 months after the disease.</li><li>\u2022 Option C: 6-12 months after the disease. This timing allows for a reasonable period of observation and recovery following the acute phase of the disease. By waiting for 6 to 12 months, medical professionals can assess the stability of the child's muscle function and determine whether surgical intervention is necessary to improve function and prevent deformities. This timeframe also aligns with the concept of early intervention to address muscle weakness and prevent secondary complications, such as joint contractures. Therefore, option C is a plausible timing for tendon transfer operation in a child with polio paralysis.</li><li>\u2022 Option C: 6-12 months after the disease.</li><li>\u2022 Option D: After skeleton maturation. Delaying surgery until skeletal maturity may be considered when there are concerns about the child's growth potential, joint development, or when the risks of surgery outweigh the benefits at an earlier age. However, postponing surgery until skeletal maturation may also result in prolonged functional limitations, increased risk of joint deformities, and missed opportunities for early intervention to improve muscle function and mobility.</li><li>\u2022 Option D: After skeleton maturation.</li><li>\u2022 Educational objective:</li><li>\u2022 Educational objective:</li><li>\u2022 In a 3-year-old child with polio paralysis, the tendon transfer option is done 2 years after the disease i.e., when the child turns 5 years old to observe the patient\u2019s recovery and give time for the muscles to stabilize.</li><li>\u2022 In a 3-year-old child with polio paralysis, the tendon transfer option is done 2 years after the disease i.e., when the child turns 5 years old to observe the patient\u2019s recovery and give time for the muscles to stabilize.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Winging of scapula . In a patient with a winged scapula, the medial or lateral aspect of the scapula appears to be protruding from the back. It can create a winged appearance. The most common etiology of a winged scapula is damaged or impaired innervation to the serratus anterior muscle. The nerve that innervates this muscle is the long thoracic nerve. Some patients may also complain of an inability to raise the affected arm above their head.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Winging of scapula</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Claw hand . When the ulnar nerve is injured, the muscles innervated by the nerve begin to weaken. This leads to an imbalance between the strong extrinsic muscles (i.e., extensor digitorum communis) and the weakened intrinsic muscles (i.e., interossei and lumbricals). This imbalance is characterized clinically by metacarpophalangeal (MCP) hyperextension and proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and distal interphalangeal (DIP) flexion, known as claw hand deformity.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Claw hand</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Wrist drop . Wrist drop is a disorder caused by radial nerve palsy. Because of the radial nerve's innervation of the extensor muscles of the wrist and digits, those whose radial nerve function has been compromised cannot actively extend them. As such, the hand hangs flaccidly in a position of flexion when the patient attempts to bring the arm to a horizontal position. Causes of wrist drop can range for penetrative trauma to external compression (Saturday night palsy) to systemic nutritional deficiencies.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Radial nerve entrapment. Radial nerve entrapment is an uncommon diagnosis. The most location of entrapment is the proximal forearm. Radial nerve entrapment often results from overuse but can occur secondary to other causes such as direct trauma, fractures, lacerations, compressive devices, or post-surgical changes. Symptoms usually develop very slowly. Symptoms include pain, sensory and motor changes, paresthesias, and/or paralysis limited to the dorsoradial aspect of the distal forearm and hand. If radial nerve entrapment has resulted in only mild damage (neurapraxia), recovery should be rapid and complete in 2 to 8 weeks. However, more severe injuries (axonotmesis) will recover more slowly.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Radial nerve entrapment.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Thoracic outlet syndrome . Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) manifests when pressures in the thoracic outlet increase to the point of impinging vessels or nerves. These pressures can result from several anatomical abnormalities, such as the thoracic ribs or space-occupying lesions, including tumors or cysts. Nebulous pain is one of the most common complaints. Venous obstruction can present with upper extremity swelling, venous distention, and pain ranging from the hand to the forearm. Upper extremity deep venous thromboses (DVTs) can also be present. Patients who undergo conservative therapy have their symptoms resolve in about 90% of cases.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Thoracic outlet syndrome</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Hysteria . Histrionic personality disorder (HPD) is characterized by a pervasive pattern of attention-seeking behaviours and a theatrical level of emotional reactions. The condition is usually life-long, though onset is typically in late adolescence or early adulthood. Individuals with HPD are often described as narcissistic, self-indulgent, flirtatious, dramatic, extroverted, and animated. Individuals with HPD may feel underappreciated or disregarded when they are not the center of attention. They may be vibrant, enchanting, overly seductive, or inappropriately sexual. People presenting with HPD typically demonstrate rapidly shifting and shallow emotions that others may perceive as insincere. Several factors are believed to contribute to the development of HPD, including genetic predisposition, childhood experiences, and environmental influences. Ultimately, HPD is unlikely to resolve on its own or with treatment.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

The intradermal injection of histamine causes triple response (red reaction due to capillary dilatation, wheal due to fluid extravasation from increased permeability, and flare due to arteriolar dilatation and to axon reflex in sensory nerve). If there is response with flare in an otherwise unconscious skin area, then the lesion has to be proximal to the dorsal root ganglion, which means that it must be a root avulsion injury. On the contrary, when the lesion is postganglionic the test will be negative as the continuity between the skin and dorsal root ganglion will have been interrupted.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Muscle entrapment in a closed space is commonly referred to as compartment syndrome . This condition occurs when there is increased pressure within a muscle compartment, leading to reduced blood flow, nerve compression, and tissue damage.

As a result, blood flow may be impeded, potentially causing symptoms such as swelling, pain, and discomfort in the affected area.

As a result, blood flow through the artery may be restricted, leading to symptoms such as pain, numbness, or weakness in the affected limb. Arterial entrapment syndrome typically requires medical evaluation and may be managed with interventions such as surgical release of the entrapped artery or vascular reconstruction to restore normal blood flow.</li><li>\u2022 Option D: Artery entrapped in closed space</li><li>\u2022 arterial entrapment syndrome or arterial compression syndrome</li><li>\u2022 Educational objective:</li><li>\u2022 Educational objective:</li><li>\u2022 Compression neuropathy refers to entrapment of the nerves in a closed space.

C) Patient has injured the radial nerve in the spiral groove</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 :</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Patient has an injury to the median nerve. False. In the given scenario, the patient sustained blunt trauma followed by fracture which caused wrist drop, loss of finger extension and sensations on lateral aspect of wrist joint. The median nerve can also be injured from blunt trauma or compression neuropathy. The motor symptoms includes loss of ability to abduct and oppose the thumb (ape thumb deformity), weak forearm pronation, and wrist and finger flexion. Sensory loss appears in the thumb, index finger, middle finger and radial aspect of the ring finger.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Patient has an injury to the median nerve.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. He should also lost extension of the forearm. False. Loss of extension of the forearm typically occurs when there is involvement of the radial nerve at a higher level in the arm, such as in the axilla or proximal to the elbow. Injuries to the radial nerve at higher levels can affect the triceps muscle, which is responsible for extending the forearm at the elbow joint. Therefore, patients commonly present with weakness or paralysis of forearm extension in addition to wrist drop. However, in the scenario provided, the patient's symptoms are consistent with a radial nerve injury in the spiral groove of the humerus, which primarily affects the wrist extensor muscles and sensation in the dorsal aspect of the hand and lateral aspect of the wrist joint. Injuries at this level typically spare the triceps muscle, preserving forearm extension.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. He should also lost extension of the forearm.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. There is combined involvement of the radial nerve and median nerve. False. While it is possible to sustain injuries to multiple nerves simultaneously, such as in cases of complex trauma or nerve compression syndromes, the symptoms described in the scenario are more consistent with isolated radial nerve injury. There is no mention of symptoms that would suggest median nerve involvement, such as weakness in thumb opposition or flexion of the wrist and fingers.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Dupuytren\u2019s contracture. Dupuytren disease starts as a palpable nodule in the palm, usually at the distal palmar crease. The nodules enlarge into cords and present with palpable cords along the palm. As the cords thicken and shorten, they cause fixed flexion contractures of the fingers at the MCP and PIP joints. At this stage, there is loss of range of motion of the hand and palpable cords in the palm extending into the affected digits. The 4th digit is most often affected, followed by the 5th digit. In most cases, palpation of the nodules does not elicit pain unless the ulnar nerve is compressed.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Dupuytren\u2019s contracture.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Erb\u2019s palsy.

Chronic ischemia to limbs due to popliteal artery injury . Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is a very rare pathology that can cause lower extremity ischemia in healthy young people. Chronic critical limb ischemia is manifested by pain at rest, non-healing wounds and gangrene. Ischemic rest pain is typically described as a burning pain in the arch or distal foot that occurs while the patient is recumbent but is relieved when the patient returns to a position in which the feet are dependent. Gangrene is usually found on the toes.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Chronic ischemia to limbs due to popliteal artery injury</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Complete injury of sciatic nerve . Sciatic nerve injury occurs due to trauma (pressure, stretching or cutting) to the nerve and can cause symptoms such as paresthesias, loss of muscle power and pain. Trauma like hip dislocation and acetabular fracture; Iatrogenic causes like Direct surgical trauma, Faulty positioning during anaesthesia, Injection of neurotoxic substances, Tourniquets, Dressings, casts or faulty fitting orthotics, and Radiation. The common symptoms are pain and abnormal gait pattern, External rotation and abduction contracture of the hip, Equinovarus or Equinus deformity, Muscular weakness/atrophy, and Motor and sensory deficit such as paraesthesia and numbness.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Complete injury of sciatic nerve</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Injury to hamstring muscles . Hamstring injuries most commonly occur at the myotendinous junction in running athletes as a result of sudden hip flexion and knee extension. The patient may feel a sudden pain in the posterior thigh during running, kicking or jumping activity. Occasionally, a \"pop\" felt. Common symptoms includes posterior thigh pain, hamstring tightness and pain with sitting. There may be a palpable mass in middle 1/3 of posterior thigh. The patient walks with a \"stiff-legged\" gait (avoiding knee and hip flexion). The patient may also have peroneal nerve weakness.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Ilioinguinal nerve. Ilioinguinal neuralgia is a frequent cause of pain in the lower abdomen and the upper thigh and is commonly caused by entrapment or injury of the nerve after lower abdominal surgeries. The ilioinguinal nerve is responsible for motor innervation of the transverse abdominis and internal oblique muscles. It provides sensory innervation to a region of the upper anteromedial thigh. In males, it also supplies sensory innervation to the anterior surface of the scrotum and root of the penis and in females, supplies sensory innervation to the labia majora and mons pubis. Male or female patients with ilioinguinal neuralgia may complain of pain, paresthesia and abnormal sensation in the area supplied by the nerve.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Ilioinguinal nerve.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Genitofemoral nerve . Genitofemoral neuralgia is a cause of neuropathic pain that is characterized by chronic neuropathic groin pain that is localized along the distribution of the genitofemoral nerve. The symptoms include groin pain, paresthesias, and burning sensation spreading from the lower abdomen to the medial aspect of the thigh. It may present with scrotal pain in male, while females experience symptoms radiating to the labia majora and mons pubis. Genitofemoral neuropathy has been attributed to iatrogenic nerve injury during inguinal and femoral herniorrhaphy.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Genitofemoral nerve</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Saphenous nerve . Compression of the saphenous nerve typically occurs at the adductor canal or at the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve as it courses near the medial femoral condyle. Patients typically complain of vague dull or achy pain located in the area of the anteromedial knee, with burning or other neuropathic qualities. The pain is often reported as worse with stairs, prolonged walking, and sitting.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Benediction Hand Sign can be seen due to median nerve palsy when the patient is asked to oppose the tip of the thumb and the tip of the little finger. In the next step, the patient is asked to make a fist. Paralysis of the opponens pollicis makes it impossible to bring the tips of the thumb and little finger into opposition. Because of this opposition weakness, the patient cannot make a fist. This produces the deformity where only the ring and little fingers are flexed while the other digits remain extended. Paralysis of the opponens, abductor pollicis brevis, and flexor pollicis brevis muscles coupled with the antagonistic pull of the adductor pollicis causes the thumb to lie in the plane of the fingers, creating a deformity resembling an apes hand, and the patient is unable to oppose the thumb.

The anterior interosseous nerve primarily innervates the deep muscles of the forearm, such as the flexor pollicis longus, flexor digitorum profundus to the index finger, and pronator quadratus. Damage to this nerve typically results in weakness or paralysis of these specific muscles, leading to difficulty with pinch grip and loss of flexion at the distal interphalangeal joints of the thumb and index finger.

This can result in weakness or paralysis of the triceps brachii, extensor muscles of the forearm, and wrist, finger, and thumb extension.
