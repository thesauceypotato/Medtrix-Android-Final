Other common disaccharides usually have \u03b1-bonds (see other figures) Lactose is the major sugar in milk .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option A: Spinach Spinach mostly contains some complex carbohydrates and a minor amount of sugar. Free galactose is not present in the spinach It is a good source of B vitamins and important minerals Option C: Table Sugar Table sugar contains sucrose which is a disaccharide made of glucose and fructose joined by \u03b1 (1\u21922) bond . Due to no free functional group, it is non-reducing in nature. Also, present abundantly in sugarcane juice and sugar beet. Option D: Germinating grain In the germinating grains, maltose/malt sugar is formed by the action of \u03b1-amylases which hydrolyses stored starch to maltose, and limit dextrins, and other smaller oligosaccharides by breaking \u03b1(1\u21924) glycosidic bonds. Maltose is also present in fruits, honey, and corn syrup</p>\n<p></p>",

If at penultimate carbon -OH is on right it is given the designation as D isomer and if -OH is on left it is given the designation as L isomer (See fig below). Note: As seen in glucose, the orientation of -H and -OH changes at all of the chiral carbons but for giving D- and L- notations, we look at the penultimate carbon / 2nd last carbon. That\u2019s why it is also known as reference carbon.

Two types of anomers are: Alpha (\u03b1) - at functional carbon, \u2013OH is downwards Beta (\u03b2) - at functional carbon, \u2013OH is upwards Option C: Epimerism Epimers are stereoisomers that differ in configuration around a single asymmetric carbon other than the anomeric carbon. Epimers of glucose can be remembered as M annose -C2 epimer, A llose -C3 epimer, G alactose -C4 epimer I dose -C5 epimer. Option D: Diastereomers Diastereomers are those stereoisomers that differ in H and OH configuration around one or more stereocenters but not all of them. Epimers are also diastereomers with different configurations around only one stereocenter. They differ from enantiomers in that the enantiomers have different conformation around all the stereocenters. Examples are Mannose and galactose which differ in configuration at two chiral centers</p>\n<p></p>",
