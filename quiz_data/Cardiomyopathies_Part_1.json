      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Peripartum cardiomyopathy Peripartum (postpartum) cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is defined as an idiopathic cardiomyopathy that presents with heart failure secondary to left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction toward the end of pregnancy or in the months after delivery, in the absence of any other cause of heart failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>PPCM is diagnosed when the following criteria are met: Heart failure - develops in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months of delivery Heart pumping - function is reduced, with an ejection fraction (EF) of less than 45% No other cause for heart failure with reduced EF can be found. In this question anaemia, MI and Pulmonary embolism have been ruled out.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Acute MI- Ruled out as chest pain at rest, elevated cardiac markers or ECG changes are not present. Option: B. DVT with PE -Develops suddenly and is a close answer but the point against is Echo finding of only a low ejection fraction. In PE, Echo shows RV dyskinesia with or without tricuspid regurgitation. The interventricular septal deviation is also seen Option: C. Amniotic fluid embolism -Ruled out as it occurs immediately during active labour.</p>\n<p></p>",

Ruled out because Dilated cardiomyopathy has a history of pedal edema due to right ventricle compliance being lesser, effort intolerance due to left ventricle not effectively able to pump out the blood. So, a feature of heart failure, is dicrotic pulse in patient. Option: C. Arrhythmogenic right ventricle dysplasia is characterized by an abnormal wave in ECG called the Epsilon wave. This condition can result in S.C.D (Sudden cardiac death) Due to a defect of desmosome there is the deposition of fibro fatty deposition in the right ventricular myocardium. There is the development of ectopic focus that causes TDP in patients and leads to death. Option: D. There should be a history of chronic stable angina</p>\n<p></p>",
