      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Maintain IA afferent activity during contraction of muscle The absence of both the myotatic (stretch) and reverse myotatic reflexes in the lower extremities suggests damage to the muscle spindle, which is the receptor primarily responsible for the stretch reflex. Gamma (\u03b3) motor neurons play an important role in regulating muscle spindle sensitivity and function, so damage to these neurons could result in the absence of the stretch reflex. Therefore, the correct answer is B, maintain IA afferent activity during contraction of muscle.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The \u03b3 motor neurons innervate the intrafusal fibers of the muscle spindles. When a skeletal muscle contracts, the intrafusal muscle fiber becomes slack and the IA afferents stop firing. By stimulating the intrafusal muscle fibers during a contraction, the \u03b3 motoneurons prevent the intrafusal muscle fibers from becoming slack and thus maintain IA firing during the contraction. Activation of \u03b3 motor neurons causes the contractile ends of the intrafusal fibers to shorten and therefore stretches the nuclear bag portion of the spindles, deforming the endings, and initiating impulses in IA When the whole muscle is stretched, the muscle spindle is also stretched and its sensory endings are activated at a frequency proportional to the degree of stretching (\u201cloading the spindle\u201d). Spindle afferents stop firing when the muscle contracts (\u201cunloading the spindle\u201d). Stimulation of \u03b3-motor neurons causes the contractile ends of the intrafusal fibers to shorten. This stretches the nuclear bag region, initiating impulses in sensory fibers. If the whole muscle is stretched during stimulation of the \u03b3-motor neurons, the rate of discharge in sensory fibers is further increased.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. Stimulate skeletal muscle fibers to contract, refers to alpha (\u03b1) motor neurons, which innervate extrafusal muscle fibers and directly cause muscle contraction. Option C. Generate activity in IB afferent fibers, is incorrect because IB afferent fibers are not involved in the stretch reflex or the regulation of muscle spindle function. Option D. Detecting the length of resting skeletal muscle, is also incorrect because muscle spindle fibers , not gamma motor neurons, are responsible for detecting changes in muscle length.</p>\n<p></p>",

Twenty to thirty percent of all cases occurring in North America, Europe, and Australia are preceded by infection or reinfection with Campylobacter jejuni . The postulated immunopathogenesis of GBS associated with jejuni infection involves the production of autoantibodies against gangliosides present on the surface of Schwann cells, causing widespread myelin damage. Diagnosis : GBS is a descriptive entity. The diagnosis of AIDP is made by recognizing the pattern of rapidly evolving paralysis with areflexia, absence of fever or other systemic symptoms, and characteristic antecedent events along with CSF findings. In CSF: Consisting of an elevated CSF protein level (1-10 g/L [100-1000 mg/dL]) without accompanying pleocytosis which is called albuminocytologic dissociation. TREATMENT : Treatment should be initiated as soon after diagnosis as possible. Usually, after ~2 weeks after the first motor symptoms, it is not known whether immunotherapy is still effective Either high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) or plasmapheresis (PLEX can be initiated: Combination is NOT used IVIg is often the initial therapy chosen because of its ease of administration and good safety record Glucocorticoids are not effective in GBS. In the worsening phase of GBS, most patients require monitoring in a critical care setting.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Types of skeletal muscle fibers Muscle fiber type grouping\n  commonly occurs due to reinnervation of denervated muscle fibers in\n  peripheral nerve damage.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The corticoreticular fibers The corticoreticular fibers are most likely affected in this case. Corticoreticular fibers are one of the major output pathways from the motor cortex to the brainstem. It innervates axial muscles and the proximal muscles of the extremities; therefore, it is involved in gait function and postural control.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>They project widely and diffusely within the pontomedullary reticular formation. Spasticity results from overactivity of the motor neurons innervating the skeletal musculature. Under normal circumstances, these \u03b1 motor neurons are tonically stimulated by reticulospinal and vestibulospinal fibers originating in the brainstem. These brainstem fibers are normally inhibited by fibers originating in the cortex. Cutting the cortical fibers releases the brainstem fibers from inhibition and results in spasticity. Cutting the fibers from the reticular formation, vestibular nuclei, or IA afferents will reduce the spasticity.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. The corticospinal tract belongs to one of the most important descending tracts of the CNS. It contains fibers from the upper motor neurons to synapse on the lower motor neurons. Option B. Vestibulospinal tracts are descending tracts present in the spinal cord, i.e., a bundle of nerve fibers that carry information from the higher centers of the brain to the peripheral parts of the body. Option C. A type IA sensory fiber or a primary afferent fiber is a type of afferent nerve fiber. It is the sensory fiber of a stretch receptor called the muscle spindle found in muscles, which constantly monitors the rate at which a muscle stretch changes.</p>\n<p></p>",

The function of intrafusal fiber contraction is not to provide force to the muscle; rather, gamma activation of the intrafusal fiber is necessary to keep the muscle spindle taut, and therefore, sensitive to stretch, over a wide range of muscle lengths.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The spindles have a motor nerve supply of their own called \u03b3-motor neurons They are 3\u20136 \u00b5m in diameter and constitute about 30% of the fibers in the ventral roots. There are two types of \u03b3-motor neurons: dynamic which supplies dynamic nuclear bag fibers and static which supplies static nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers. Activation of dynamic \u03b3-motor neurons increases the dynamic sensitivity of the group Ia endings. Activation of the static \u03b3-motor neurons increases the tonic level of activity in both group Ia and II endings, decreases the dynamic sensitivity of group Ia afferents, and can prevent silencing of Ia afferents during muscle stretch. Diagrammatic representation of the main components of mammalian muscle spindle including intrafusal muscle fibers, afferent sensory fiber endings, and efferent motor fibers (V- motor neurons). B) Three types of intrafusal muscle fibers: dynamic nuclear bag, static nuclear bag, and nuclear chain fibers. A single la afferent fiber innervates all three types of fibers to form a primary sensory ending. A group Il sensory fiber innervates nuclear chain and static bag fibers to form a secondary sensory ending. Dynamic-motor neurons innervate dynamic bag fibers; static v-motor neurons innervate combinations of chain and static bag fibers.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A.
