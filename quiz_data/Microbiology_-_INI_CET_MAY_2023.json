Capsules may be readily demonstrated by negative staining in wet films with India ink , when they are seen as clear halos around the bacteria, against a black background Capsular material is antigenic and may be demonstrated by serological methods. When a suspension of a capsulated bacteria is mixed with its specific anti- capsular serum and examined under the microscope, the capsule becomes very prominent and appears 'swollen' due to an increase in its refractivity : Quellung reaction Types of capsules Organisms Capsules Streptococcus pneumonia Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumonia Neisseria meningitidis Salmonella typhii Clostridium perfringens Bordetella pertussis Polysaccharide capsule Streptococcus pyogenes Hyaluronic acid Bacillus anthracis Polypeptide(poly-d-capsule)</p>\n<p></p>",

Listeria monocytogenes is motile at room temperature(20-25 degree celsius) but not at 37 degree celsius.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Listeria exhibits a characteristic slow tumbling end-over-end motility at 22-28\u00b0C but is non-motile at 37\u00b0C. This is because the peritrichous flagella are produced by the bacillus optimally between 20\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C. This is known as differential motility as the motility pattern changes with a change in temperature. Listeria monocytogenes is a gram- positive bacillus. It can survive at refrigerator temperatures (4\u00b0C) , under conditions of low pH and high salt . So it is able to overcome food preservation and safety barriers, making it an important foodborne pathogen . The virulence factor produced by Listeria is called listeriolysin . This helps the bacteria to escape and causes septicemia. They are catalase-positive , will not produce H2S , and show beta hemolysis . This helps to differentiate Listeria from other gram-positive bacilli.</p>\n<p></p>",

It primarily affects the internal organs, particularly the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. Fever: Persistent and prolonged fever is a hallmark symptom of kala-azar. The fever tends to be irregular and can be accompanied by chills and sweats. Splenomegaly : Enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) is a characteristic feature of kala-azar. The spleen can become massively enlarged, leading to discomfort or pain in the left upper abdomen. Leukopenia and Thrombocytopenia : The infection can lead to reduced levels of white blood cells (leukopenia) and platelets (thrombocytopenia), which can increase the risk of infections and bleeding. Lymphadenopathy : Enlarged lymph nodes, especially those near the spleen, liver, and abdomen, can occur in some cases.Edema: Swelling of the extremities, face, or abdomen due to fluid retention can occur.Darkening of the Skin: In some cases, individuals with kala-azar may develop a characteristic darkening of the skin, which is more noticeable in areas exposed to the sun. PKDL is characterized by the presence of skin lesions that can vary in appearance.Lesions can range from macules (flat, discolored spots) to papules (raised, small bumps) to nodules (larger, firm lesions).Lesions are usually found on the face, neck, upper body, and limbs.

Chorioretinitis is a common ocular manifestation of congenital toxoplasmosis and can occur later in childhood or even adulthood.

It can result in an enlarged head size in infants due to the expanding ventricles. Hydrocephalus can cause a range of neurological symptoms, including headaches, vomiting, irritability, and developmental delays.

Immunocompromised individuals are at an increased risk of systemic candidiasis The most common species implicated in candidal infections are C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. glabrata Morphologically, they are yeast-like fungi . They exist as yeast and pseudohyphae. It appears as budding gram-positive cells on wet films and smears . Mycelial forms suggest colonization Clinical spectrum of Candidal infections Oral Candidiasis (Thrush): Affects the mouth and throat. Presents as white patches on the tongue, inner cheeks, and roof of the mouth. Genital Candidiasis (Vaginal Yeast Infection): Affects the vagina and vulva in females, and the penis in males. Causes itching, burning, and white, cottage cheese-like discharge. Cutaneous Candidiasis: Affects skin in warm, moist areas, such as under breasts, groin, and folds of skin. Causes red, itchy, and sometimes painful rash. Invasive Candidiasis: Affects internal organs and bloodstream, often in hospitalized patients with weakened immune systems. Can lead to serious bloodstream infections Antifungal Medications: Topical creams, ointments, antifungal i.e clotrimazole, nystatin medications amd oral fluconazole are commonly prescribed. Risk factors for candidiasis: Weakened Immune System: Individuals with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV/AIDS patients, transplant recipients) are more susceptible. Diabetes: Poorly controlled diabetes can create favorable conditions for yeast overgrowth. Antibiotics: Disrupt the balance of normal flora, allowing Candida to proliferate. Pregnancy: Hormonal changes can encourage yeast growth. Medications: Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants can increase the risk.
