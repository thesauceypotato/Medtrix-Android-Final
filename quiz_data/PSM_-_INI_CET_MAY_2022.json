HPV is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract. Most sexually active women and men will be infected at some point in their lives, and some may be repeatedly infected. Anal cancer is closely related to a sexually transmitted infection called human papillomavirus (HPV). Evidence of HPV is detected in the majority of anal cancers. HPV is thought to be the most common cause of anal cancers. HPV can infect the mouth and throat and cause cancers of the oropharynx (back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils). This is called oropharyngeal cancer. HPV is thought to cause 70% of oropharyngeal cancers in the United States. Laryngeal papillomatosis is a disease that is caused by a viral etiology. The virus that has been associated with LP is the human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV is a small deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) nonenveloped capsid virus of the Papovaviridae family, which has a predilection of infecting epithelial cells.</p>\n<p></p>",
