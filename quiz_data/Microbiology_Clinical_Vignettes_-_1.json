He was referred by his primary care physician for a liver transplant evaluation and is scheduled to begin his evaluation next month. His vital signs included blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, heart rate of 105 beats/min, temperature of 38.5\u00b0C, and respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min with O2 saturation of 97% on room air. He is somnolent but is able to answer questions accurately. His skin is notable for many spider telangiectasias and palmar erythema. He has a distended diffusely tender abdomen with a positive fluid wave. Paracentesis reveals slightly cloudy fluid with WBC 1000/\u00b5L and 40% neutrophils. His blood pressure increases to 100/65 mmHg, and his heart rate decreases to 95 beats/min after 1 L of intravenous fluids.

He also has noticed some pain and swelling near his right elbow. None of the friends he camped with have been similarly ill. His vital signs are blood pressure of 106/65 mmHg, heart rate of 116 beats/min, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, and temperature of 38.7\u00b0C. His oxygen saturation is 93% on room air. He appears mildly tachypneic and flushed. His conjunctiva are not injected, and his mucous membranes are dry. The chest examination reveals crackles in the right mid-lung field and left base. His heart rate is tachycardic but regular. There is a II/VI systolic ejection murmur heard best at the lower left sternal border. His abdominal examination is unremarkable. On the right hand, there is an erythematous ulcer with a punched-out center covered by a black eschar. He has no cervical lymphadenopathy, but there are markedly enlarged and tender lymph nodes in the right axillae and epitrochlear regions. The epitrochlear node has some fluctuance with palpation. A chest radiograph shows fluffy bilateral alveolar infiltrates. Over the first 12 hours of his hospitalization, the patient becomes progressively hypotensive and hypoxic, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Physical examination reveals a slightly distressed man with disheveled appearance. His temperature is 38.2\u00b0C, heart rate is 90 beats/ min, and blood pressure is 127/74 mmHg. He has poor dentition. Cardiac examination reveals an early diastolic murmur over the left third intercostal space. His spleen is tender and 2 cm descended below the costal margin. He has tender painful red nodules on the tips of the third finger of his right hand and on the fourth finger of his left hand that are new. He has nits evident on his clothes consistent with body louse infection. White blood cell count is 14,500/\u00b5L, with 5% band forms and 93% polymorphonuclear cells. Blood cultures are drawn followed by empirical vancomycin therapy. These culture results remain negative for growth 5 days later. He remains febrile but hemodynamically stable but does develop a new lesion on his toe similar to those on his fingers on hospital day 3. A transthoracic echocardiogram reveals a 1-cm mobile vegetation on the cusp of his aortic valve and moderate aortic regurgitation. A CT scan of the abdomen shows an enlarged spleen with wedge-shaped splenic and renal infarctions. What test should be sent to confirm the most likely diagnosis?",

Over the past month, he notices that his daily productive cough has worsened and the phlegm in dark yellow. He also reports that he has developed a number of skin lesions that start as a painful nodule and then over 1 week ulcerate and discharge pus (see Figure below). His physical examination is notable for egophony and bronchial breath sounds in the right lower lobe, and approximately 5 to 10 ulcerating 4- to 8-cm skin lesions on the lower extremities consistent with the one shown in the figure. His chest radiograph shows right lower lobe consolidation with no pleural effusion and no evidence of hilar or mediastinal adenopathy.
