The standard first-line therapy includes a combination of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) with an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam such as ceftazidime. This regimen targets Burkholderia cepacia effectively due to its synergistic antimicrobial action and has shown success in reducing morbidity and complications associated with the infection.

The diagnosis of H. pylori infection can be made using both invasive and non-invasive tests. Non-invasive methods include the urea breath test, stool antigen test, and serological tests. Invasive methods involve endoscopy with biopsy, where a biopsy urease test, histological examination, or culture can be performed to diagnose the infection and determine antibiotic resistance. The commonly used eradication regimen involves triple therapy, including a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) like omeprazole, combined with two antibiotics, typically amoxicillin and clarithromycin, administered for 14 days. After completing treatment, a PPI is often continued for an additional 30 days to promote ulcer healing. The urea breath test is the preferred method for confirming eradication as it directly measures active infection.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

ECG findings can mimic an acute coronary syndrome, with ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversions, but coronary angiography typically shows no significant coronary artery blockages. The pathophysiology involves neurogenic myocardial stunning primarily due to excessive catecholamine release, which affects myocardial contractility.

HLA-identical sibling donors are preferred due to their significantly lower risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and better transplant outcomes.
