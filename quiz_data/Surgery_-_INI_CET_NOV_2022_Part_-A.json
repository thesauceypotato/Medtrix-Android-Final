Further upward extension obstructs the lower end of one or both ureters, with obstruction of both resulting in anuria. The rectum may become stenosed by tumor-infiltrating around it, but direct involvement is rare Spread by the bloodstream Spread by the bloodstream occurs particularly to the bone; indeed, the prostate is the most common site of origin for skeletal metastases, followed in turn by the breast, the kidney, the bronchus, and the thyroid gland. The bones most frequently involved by prostate carcinoma are the pelvic bones and the lower lumbar vertebrae. The femoral head, ribcage, and skull are other common sites Lymphatic Spread Lymphatic spread may occur via (i) lymphatic vessels passing to the obturator fossa or along the sides of the rectum to the lymph nodes beside the internal iliac vein and in the hollow of the sacrum and (ii) lymphatics that pass over the seminal vesicles and follow the vas deferens for a short distance to drain into the external iliac lymph nodes.

Anemia is the most common metabolic defect after gastrectomy. Iron deficiency anemia is more common than megaloblastic anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency after gastrectomy. Iron deficiency anemia after gastrectomy is caused by decreased iron intake, impaired iron absorption, and chronic blood loss. Megaloblastic anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency after gastrectomy is rare and depends on the amount of stomach removed. Poor absorption of dietary vitamin B12 due to the lack of intrinsic factors causes megaloblastic anemia after gastrectomy. Patients who have undergone subtotal gastrectomy should be given lifelong vitamin B12 supplementation . Osteoporosis and osteomalacia have been observed after gastric resection and are caused by deficiencies in calcium. Calcium malabsorption is aggravated by fat malabsorption after gastrectomy. Bone disease generally develops about 4-5 years after surgery. Calcium supplements and vitamin D treat osteoporosis and osteomalacia after gastrectomy. Patients who have undergone Billroth II or Roux-en-Y reconstruction that bypasses the duodenum should also receive supplementation of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K) after gastrectomy.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Tension Pneumothorax ABCDE of trauma Airway and cervical spine control - Airway should be assessed for patency. Foreign bodies and vomit should be removed, and facial, mandibular, tracheal, and laryngeal injuries should be excluded clinically. Breathing and ventilation - The lungs, chest wall, and diaphragm must be assessed for potential acute injuries that could compromise ventilation. These injuries include tension pneumothorax, tension haemothorax, flail chest, and open pneumothorax Circulation and haemorrhage control - The patient's hemodynamic state must be assessed quickly and accurately. Any external source of bleeding should be identified and dealt with immediately using manual pressure. When the examination or history suggests internal injury, a pelvic radiograph should be taken, and limited ultrasonography (FAST) done to exclude hidden blood loss. Disability and neurological status - The patient's neurological state is assessed with the Glasgow coma scale. It is easy and quick to use and is a determinant of patient outcome and possible further management. Exposure and environment - The patient should be fully exposed (by cutting off all clothes) to allow a full examination. However, it is critical to keep the patient warm with blankets and a heated emergency room. Large volumes of fluids may be infused, and these intravenous fluids should be warmed. Tension pneumothorax is an uncommon condition with a malignant course that might result in death if left untreated. It is a severe condition that results when air is trapped in the pleural space under positive pressure, displacing mediastinal structures and compromising cardiopulmonary function. Treatment of tension pneumothorax is immediate needle decompression by inserting a large-bore (eg, 14- or 16-gauge) needle into the 2nd intercostal space in the midclavicular line.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency that can result in respiratory failure or cardiovascular collapse. It can be diagnosed clinically without the need for radiographic confirmation. The symptoms of tension pneumothorax include deviation of the trachea , unilaterally absent or diminished breath sounds, and cardiopulmonary compromise. If these symptoms are present, thoracic decompression should be rapidly performed with a large-bore needle or tube thoracostomy, depending on the availability of equipment and supplies.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In addition to tension pneumothorax, massive hemothorax also requires tube thoracostomy with the evacuation of blood and reexpansion of the lung. Severe pulmonary contusion may require aggressive mechanical ventilation with elevated levels of positive end-expiratory pressure. However, to avoid loss of positive end-expiratory pressure, the ventilator should not be repeatedly disconnected for suction or manual ventilation as oxygenation will only improve with an uninterrupted circuit</p>\n<p></p>",

These four drugs are used thrice weekly for the initial two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for an additional four months</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Causes and Risk Factors: tuberculosis is responsible for all cases of GI tuberculosis. bovis has largely been eliminated by public health measures. Intestinal tuberculosis is more common in poor socioeconomic status. Ingestion of contaminated food may cause primary tuberculosis. Tuberculous bacilli can be ingested through swallowed sputum. Primary intestinal tuberculosis can lead to secondary intestinal tuberculosis. The earliest intestinal lesions are found in the submucosa, while the overlying mucosa is normal. The most common site of involvement is the terminal ileum and ileocecal junction. Other affected regions, in decreasing frequency, include the colon, jejunum, rectum, anal canal, duodenum, stomach, and esophagus. Site of predilection is dictated by the abundance of lymphoid tissue, rate of absorption of intestinal contents, prolonged stasis, and digestive activity of intestinal contents. Clinical Features: Initial symptoms are vague and non-specific. As the disease progresses, individuals may develop fever, night sweats, malaise, weakness, anorexia, and weight loss. The most common symptom of GI tuberculosis is abdominal pain. Diarrhea is another common symptom. Abdominal distention suggests the presence of ascites or subacute intestinal obstruction. Diagnosis: The most common laboratory abnormality is a raised ESR. Ascitic fluid may show lymphocytosis, high protein content, SAAG <1.1, and raised adenosine deaminase. Radiological imaging, such as ultrasound and CT scans, can help diagnose GI tuberculosis. Barium studies can also help diagnose GI tuberculosis, with characteristic features such as the Fleishner or umbrella sign, string sign, Sterlein sign, and napkin ring stenosis. Treatment: The treatment of GI tuberculosis is ATT (anti-tuberculosis treatment) . Fever, malaise, and weight loss can subside in a few weeks. The majority of patients with symptoms of subacute intestinal obstruction and evidence of intestinal strictures show complete resolution of the radiological abnormality. Surgery may be necessary for intestinal obstruction secondary to stricture, free perforation, severe GI hemorrhage, intra-abdominal abscess, or internal or external fistula.</p>\n<p></p>",

Mechanism : Serious infection, such as secondary peritonitis, may lead to SIRS through the release of lipopolysaccharide endotoxin from the walls of dying Gram-negative bacilli (mainly Escherichia coli) or other bacteria or fungi. This and other toxins stimulate the release of cytokines from macrophages. Septic manifestations and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in SIRS are mediated by the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1). There are high circulating cytokine levels, and activated neutrophils stimulate fever, tachycardia, and tachypnoea. Gut failure, colonisation and translocation related to the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). IL, interleukin; TNF, tumour necrosis factor MODS - an effect that SIRS produces systemically The activated neutrophils adhere to vascular endothelium in key organs remote from the source of infection and damage it, leading to increased vascular permeability, which in turn leads to cellular damage within the organs, which become dysfunctional and give rise to the clinical picture of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome or MODS. MSOF - end stage of uncontrolled MODS Respiratory, cardiac, intestinal, renal, and liver failure ensue with circulatory failure and shock. In this state, the body\u2019s resistance to infection is reduced, and a vicious cycle develops where the more organs that fail, the more likely it becomes that death will follow despite all that a modern ICU can do for organ support SEPSIS : Sepsis is SIRS with a documented source of infection Severe sepsis or sepsis syndrome is sepsis with evidence of the failure of one or more organs: Respiratory (acute respiratory distress syndrome) Cardiovascular (septic shock follows compromise of cardiac function and fall in peripheral vascular resistance) Renal (usually acute tubular necrosis), Hepatic, Blood coagulation systems or central nervous system SEPSIS BUNDLE (also known as the resuscitation bundle): a combination of evidence-based objectives that must be completed within 6 hours for patients presenting with severe sepsis, septic shock and lactate >4 mmol/L SEPSIS SIX: Name given to a bundle of medical therapies designed to reduce mortality in patients with sepsis.

Most commonly, it results from the shearing of cortical bridging veins Subdural hemorrhage (SDH) is a collection of blood between the dura and the arachnoid layers of the meninges Non-contrast CT is the investigation of choice. Middle meningeal artery rupture would result in an extradural hemorrhage Vertebral artery dissection leads to subarachnoid hemorrhage or sometimes intraparenchymal hemorrhage.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Acute Subdural Haematoma Type I : High-energy injury mechanisms can result in the rupture of cortical surface vessels with significant associated primary brain injury. This results in an expanding haematoma with rapid deterioration and development of signs of raised ICP reminiscent of extradural hematoma, without the lucid interval. These collections require prompt evacuation, typically by craniotomy or craniectomy. Type II : Older and often anticoagulated, a lower energy injury leads to venous bleeding around the brain. Depending on the total bleeding volume, the resulting hematoma may present early as acute subdural hematoma, after delay, and osmotic expansion as chronic subdural hematoma or may even remain clinically silent. Type III: Present much later with a further \u2018acute-onchronic\u2019 subdural hematoma. On diagnosis, the clotting function should be corrected wherever possible. Bleeds of significant size, with significantly associated midline shift or with deteriorating neurology, require urgent evacuation. Smaller bleeds in neurologically stable patients may be managed conservatively , at least initially: liquefaction of the clot over 7\u201310 days after the bleed may allow for a much less invasive evacuation through burr holes. Since the dura is not as adherent to the brain as to the skull, subdural blood is free to expand across the brain surface, giving a diffuse concave appearance. Chronic Subdural Hematoma: Common in the elderly, especially those on anticoagulants Clinical deficits result from the osmotic expansion of a degrading clot over days/weeks Diffuse hypodense lesion on CT Burr hole drainage is usually preferred</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA ,</p>\n<p></p>",

The next best step in the management is needle thoracocentesis. Tension pneumothorax is characterized by chest pain, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, tracheal deviation away from the injury side, unilateral absence of breath sound, cyanosis, and neck vein distension. Treatment consists of immediate decompression, initially by rapidly inserting a large-bore cannula on the affected side. Tube thoracostomy is mandatory after needle or finger decompression of the chest and is the definitive management. The recent update (Acc. to ATLS 10th edition): In adults, the needle thoracotomy location was changed from the 2nd ICS midclavicular line to the 5th intercostal space (ICS) mid-axillary line. In the pediatric age group , the thoracotomy location remains the same at the 2nd ICS midclavicular line.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency that can result in respiratory failure or cardiovascular collapse. It can be diagnosed clinically without the need for radiographic confirmation. The symptoms of tension pneumothorax include deviation of the trachea , unilaterally absent or diminished breath sounds, and cardiopulmonary compromise. If these symptoms are present, thoracic decompression should be rapidly performed with a large-bore needle or tube thoracostomy, depending on the availability of equipment and supplies.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In addition to tension pneumothorax, massive hemothorax also requires tube thoracostomy to evacuate blood and reexpansion the lung. Severe pulmonary contusion may require aggressive mechanical ventilation with elevated levels of positive end-expiratory pressure. However, to avoid loss of positive end-expiratory pressure, the ventilator should not be repeatedly disconnected for suction or manual ventilation as oxygenation will only improve with an uninterrupted circuit</p>\n<p></p>",
