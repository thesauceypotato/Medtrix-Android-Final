Intramedullary Nailing : This is a common and effective surgical method for stabilizing extracapsular fractures of the femur, providing good outcomes in terms of recovery and mobility. Thus, intramedullary nailing is the best management option for extracapsular neck of femur fractures, providing stability and facilitating early mobilization.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Boot and Bar Cast : Not appropriate for managing femur fractures in adults, especially those involving the hip. Option: B. Russell's Traction : Primarily used for temporary stabilization and pain relief before surgery, but not a definitive treatment for an extracapsular femur fracture. Option: C. Hemiarthroplasty : More commonly used for intracapsular fractures or in cases where there is severe joint damage or pre-existing arthritis, but not typically for extracapsular fractures.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Chronic osteomyelitis The diagnosis for a 22-year-old patient with thigh pain and the described X-ray findings is Chronic osteomyelitis Chronic Osteomyelitis : Typically presents with changes in bone structure due to infection. X-ray findings often include bone destruction, sequestra (areas of dead bone), and possibly involucrum (new bone formation around the infected area). Chronic osteomyelitis often shows irregular bone destruction and sometimes changes in the surrounding soft tissue.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Dead cortex is gradually absorbed about its surface and is detached from living bone to form a sequestrum. (this requires several months) SEQUESTRUM \u2013 a piece of dead bone, surrounded by infected granulation tissue trying to \u201ceat\u201d the sequestrum away. It appears pale having a smooth inner surface and a rough outer. When SEQUESTRUM IS COMPLETE, it lies in the free cavity and is LESS attacked by granulation tissue and is absorbed more slowly. Meanwhile, the surrounding living bone attempts to wall off the infection by forming a thick, dense wall, the INVOLUCRUM. (INVOLUCRUM is the dense sclerotic bone overlying the sequestrum). An involucrum usually has multiple openings, the cloacae, through which exudate, bone debris, and sequestra find the exit and pass through sinus tracts to the surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Osteosarcoma : Usually presents as a destructive bone lesion with an associated periosteal reaction, sometimes with a \"sunburst\" pattern or Codman's triangle on X-ray. Option: B. Osteomalacia : Characterized by softening of bones due to vitamin D deficiency, typically showing a more diffuse pattern of changes such as pseudofractures or osteopenia rather than a localized bone lesion. Option: D. Ewing's Sarcoma : Often shows a lytic bone lesion with an associated soft tissue mass and can have a characteristic \"onion-skin\" periosteal reaction.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Non-Erosive arthritis of the joint with sclerosis is seen The statement that is false about Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is Non-Erosive arthritis of the joint with sclerosis is seen AS typically features erosive changes and inflammation, particularly in the sacroiliac joints and the spine, rather than non-erosive arthritis. Sclerosis can be seen on X-rays, but it is usually accompanied by erosive changes, particularly in the sacroiliac joints. Therefore, the correct answer is D, as AS typically involves erosive changes rather than non-erosive arthritis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS It is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy, a genetically determined generalised chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the axial skeleton (sacroiliac joint & spine)</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Affects Males More Than Females : True. AS is more common in males, with a ratio of approximately 3:1 compared to females. Option: B.

Option: C. 85-95% of Patients, HLA-B27 is Positive : True. A significant percentage of patients with AS are positive for the HLA-B27 antigen, although it is not exclusive to AS.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA CLINICAL TEST IN ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS: Clinical tests Fle'che test: This is done for cervical spine involvement. The patient is made to stand with his back fixed to the wall and he tries to touch the back of his head to the wall without any movement of the chin. In case of ankylosing spondylitis the patient can not touch the wall by the back of this head. Chest expansion measurement: This is done for thoracic spine involvement. Schober's test and modified schober's test: These are done for thoracic and lumbar spine involvement. Gaenslen test: This is done for sacroiliac joint involvement. The patient is made to lie at the edge of the examination table on the side to be examined. The normal hip and knee is flexed and the patient is asked to hold the thigh. Now the side to be examined is hyperextended over the edge of the table. This produces a rotational strain over sacroiliac joint and causes pain. Pump handle test: This is done for sacroiliac joint involvement. The patient lies supine. The knee and hip of affected side are flexed and made to cross the chest and tried to bring it closed to the opposite shoulder. This produces pain on the affected side.</p>\n<p></p>",
