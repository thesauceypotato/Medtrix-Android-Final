Amniocentesis is a procedure in which amniotic fluid is removed from the uterus for testing or treatment. It should be avoided because during the amniocentesis, blood cells from the mother and fetus can mix. This can lead to Rh sensitization and breaking down of fetal red blood cells. Option: D.

Cat is the definitive host. Maternal infection is acquired by eating under cooked meat. Primary infection causes immunity which is life-long and usually prevents reinfection, i.e. if a female has toxoplasma IgG antibody before pregnancy, there is no risk for a congenitally infected fetus. Congenital Transmission: The risk of transmission increases with the period of gestation, i.e. maximum chances of infection are during 3rd trimester. Severity of infection decreases with gestational age, i.e. most in the first trimester. most severe infection occurs when toxoplasma is transmitted. In acute maternal toxoplasma infection patients are usually asymptomatic (in 80-90% cases). Some patients may present with posterior cervical lymphadenopathy (lymph s are nontender, discrete and firm), fever, fatigue, lassitude and maculopapular rash. DOC for Toxoplasma during pregnancy is spiramycin (1g every 8 hours). Spiramycin reduces the risk of congenital infection during pregnancy. If fetal infection is confirmed 3 weeks of spiramycin is alternated with 3 weeks of pyrimethamine sulfonamide combination, and continued till delivery. This is because spiramycin can prevent fetal infection but cannot treat the infection if it is present. Triad of congenital toxoplasmosis Routine maternal screening for Toxoplasma is not done. If maternal infection is confirmed, by serology and avidity testing, to confirm fetal infection following tests are done. Gold standard: Isolation of toxoplasma in the amniotic fluid by PCR. Ultrasonography to detect fetal anomalies. If the fetus is infected and hydrocephalus is resent, counseling for termination is to be done. me Presence of IgM antibody in the neonate indicates congenital infection. Treatment with pyrimethamine should be continued in these babies till 1 year of age.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. HSV  RECREATE Option: B.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Intermediate Criss-Cross Fibers Intermediate Crisscross Fibers is the middle layer. The myocytes in this layer takes the arrangement in the form of 8 . (Pinnard\u2019s living ligature ) The blood vessels run in between this Criss cross arrangement. This arrangement is so crucial in halting the bleeding after the delivery. The mechanism is constriction of blood vessels by this crisscross arrangement of myocytes after delivery.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mechanism of control of bleeding: After placental separation, innumerable torn sinuses which have free circulation of blood from uterine and ovarian vessels have to be obliterated. The, occlusion is affected by complete retraction whereby the arterioles, as they pass tortuously through the interlacing intermediate layer of the myometrium, are literally clamped  . It (living ligature) is the principal mechanism of hemostasis. However, thrombosis occurs to occlude the torn sinuses, a phenomenon, which is facilitated by hypercoagulable state of pregnancy. Apposition of the walls of the uterus following expulsion of the placenta (myotamponade) also contributes to minimize blood loss.
