In this mechanism, called tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF), an increase in NaCl concentration at the macula densa constricts the glomerular afferent arteriole and thus decreases the single-nephron GFR. Along with the myogenic response, TGF significantly contributes to renal autoregulation.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
