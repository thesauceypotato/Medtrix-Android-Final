In hypothermia, all of the electrocardiographic intervals are prolonged, including the PR interval, the QRS complex, the QT interval, and the R-R interval, owing to slowed impulse conduction through potassium channels. In addition, the J point is elevated, producing a characteristic J wave (Osborn wave) that represents distortion of the earliest phase of membrane repolarization. These changes are most prominent in the precordial leads V2 through V5. This electrocardiogram demonstrates Osborn waves (arrows).</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
