      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Decrease During exercise in physiological limits, the end-systolic volume (ESV) tends to decrease due to increased contractility and more effective ejection of blood from the left ventricle.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Changes in the stroke volume during exercise occur for both the end diastolic volume and end systolic volume. The LVEDV increases because of the increase in venous return and more blood. LVESV decreases due to increases in the strength of contraction of the myocardium.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Remains the same or decrease depending on the grade of exercise - This option is partly correct. During mild to moderate exercise, the end-systolic volume (ESV) may decrease due to increased contractility and more effective ejection of blood from the left ventricle. However, during extremely intense exercise or in conditions of extreme cardiovascular stress, the ESV may remain the same or even increase slightly as the heart may not have enough time to completely empty the left ventricle during each contraction. Option: B. Remain within physiological limits - This option is incorrect. During exercise, the end-systolic volume (ESV) typically decreases, as explained earlier. However, this decrease remains within physiological limits and is an adaptive response of the cardiovascular system to meet the increased demand for oxygen and nutrients during exercise. Option: D. Increase - This option is incorrect. The end-systolic volume (ESV) does not increase during exercise within physiological limits. In fact, it tends to decrease or, in some cases of extreme exercise, remain relatively stable.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The end-systolic volume (ESV) is the volume of blood remaining in the left ventricle at the end of systole (contraction phase of the heart). During exercise, the increased contractility of the heart and more effective ejection of blood result in a decrease in end-systolic volume. This means that more blood is being ejected from the left ventricle with each heartbeat, leaving less blood behind after the contraction. So, during exercise in physiological limits, the end-systolic volume (ESV) decreases.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Negative feedback Negative feedback - The baroreceptor reflex is an example of negative feedback, as it counteracts changes in blood pressure to maintain homeostasis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>In response to high blood pressure (hypertension), the baroreceptor reflex initiates a negative feedback loop to decrease blood pressure. The brain signals the heart to decrease its rate and force of contraction, leading to reduced cardiac output. Additionally, the reflex causes dilation of blood vessels (vasodilation), which decreases peripheral resistance and further lowers blood pressure. The baroreceptors are stretch receptors in the walls of the heart and blood vessels. These are located in carotid sinus and aortic arch. The baroreceptor reflex provides a negative feedback loop in which an elevated blood pressure reflexively causes the heart rate, myocardial contractility, stroke volume and vessel tone to decrease via signal from brain stem, ultimately causing decrease in blood pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B. Positive feedback - Positive feedback mechanisms amplify or reinforce the initial change or deviation from the set point, rather than restoring it to the normal range. In positive feedback, the response enhances the original stimulus, leading to further deviation from the initial state. This process is not observed in the baroreceptor reflex, as it aims to counteract changes in blood pressure and bring it back to the normal range. Option: C. Combination of positive and negative feedback - While some physiological processes involve a combination of positive and negative feedback mechanisms, the baroreceptor reflex is primarily an example of negative feedback. It works to reduce deviations in blood pressure, making it a classic negative feedback loop. Option: D. Feedforward inhibition - Feedforward inhibition is a mechanism where an anticipatory signal is sent ahead of a change to prepare the system for an expected perturbation. It is not the primary characteristic of the baroreceptor reflex, which responds to the actual changes in blood pressure and adjusts the response accordingly.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation_images": [],
      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Ureteric obstruction Ureteric obstruction refers to a blockage in one or both of the ureters, which can obstruct the flow of urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Ureteric obstruction can cause a decrease in GFR because it can lead to a build-up of pressure in the renal tubules and impair kidney function.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Change in renal blood flow: Increased blood flow to kidney increases the delivery of blood to glomerulus that promotes filtration and conversely decreased flow decreases filtration. Thus, renal vasodilation maintains GFR. Oncotic pressure: Osmotic pressure in glomerular capillaries due to plasma proteins opposes filtration. Therefore, hypoproteinemia results in more GFR. Conversely, dehydration decreases GFR and urine formation. Glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure: Hydrostatic pressure in glomerular capillary depends on the amount of blood delivered to and the amount of blood drained from the glomerulus: Afferent arteriolar dilation or efferent arteriolar constriction increases capillary hydrostatic pressure and therefore, increases GFR.

Conversely, afferent arteriolar constriction or efferent arteriolar dilation decreases GFR.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Increased renal blood flow: An increase in renal blood flow can lead to an increase in GFR. This is because a higher blood flow to the kidneys can result in more filtrate being formed. Option: B. Decreased plasma oncotic pressure: Plasma oncotic pressure is the osmotic pressure exerted by plasma proteins, primarily albumin. A decrease in plasma oncotic pressure would not cause an increase in GFR. In fact, a decrease in plasma oncotic pressure could result in fluid shifting out of the capillaries and into the interstitial spaces, potentially leading to edema and reduced GFR. Option: C. Increased efferent arteriole resistance: The efferent arteriole is the blood vessel that carries blood away from the glomerulus after it has been filtered. An increase in efferent arteriole resistance can lead to an increase in glomerular pressure, which in turn can increase GFR.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Bowman\u2019s capsule/tubule hydrostatic pressure: Ureteric obstruction due to calculi or other causes increases the hydrostatic pressure in the tubule. This factor opposes filtration and thus leads to a decrease in GFR. Renal stones are associated with the deposition of particles in the basement membranes of the thin loops of Henle and in the deep medullary interstitium. Such a deposition may cause interstitial inflammation and facilitate the development of fibrosis, which results in tubular cell injury and damage of renal function. Furthermore, stone passage itself causes transient obstruction, and obstruction is a well-established risk factor for renal damage.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Thick ascending limb of LOH The thick ascending limb of the Loop of Henle is impermeable to water but actively reabsorbs sodium, potassium, and chloride ions from the tubular fluid. This creates a hypertonic (concentrated) interstitium in the medulla of the kidney, which is essential for concentrating the urine and conserving water.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>There is a graded increase in the osmolality of the interstitium of the pyramids in humans: The osmolality at the tips of the papillae can reach about 1200 mOsm/kg of H 2 O, approximately four times that of plasma. The loops of Henle of the juxtamedullary nephrons dip deeply into the medullary pyramids before draining into the distal convoluted tubules in the cortex, and all the collecting ducts descend back through the medullary pyramids to drain at the tips of the pyramids into the renal pelvis. The descending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to water, due to the presence of aquaporin-1 in both the apical and basolateral membranes, but the ascending limb is impermeable to water . Na + , K + , and Cl \u2013 are cotransported out of the thick segment of the ascending limb. Therefore, the fluid in the descending limb of the loop of Henle becomes hypertonic as water moves out of the tubule into the hypertonic interstitium. In the ascending limb it becomes more dilute because of the movement of Na+ and Cl\u2013 out of the tubular lumen, and when fluid reaches the top of the ascending limb ( called the diluting segment) it is now hypotonic to plasma.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B. PCT (Proximal Convoluted Tubule): The proximal convoluted tubule is responsible for reabsorbing the majority of filtered water and solutes, including glucose, amino acids, and electrolytes. It is not the diluting segment but rather the segment responsible for reabsorbing essential substances from the filtrate. Option: C. Thin descending limb of LOH: The thin descending limb of the Loop of Henle is permeable to water but not solutes. It allows water to passively leave the tubular fluid, leading to an increase in the concentration of solutes in the tubule. Option: D. Collecting duct: The collecting duct plays a critical role in the final concentration of urine by responding to the antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which controls water reabsorption. However, it is not the primary diluting segment responsible for creating a hypertonic interstitium in the kidney.</p>\n<p></p>",
