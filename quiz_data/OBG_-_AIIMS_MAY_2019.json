PAP smears are performed extensively to screen for this cancer but this test does not always detect cervical cancer. It has only 50-80 % for detecting high-grade lesions.

Second Trimester Screening It is done between 15 weeks and 22 weeks. Triple Tes t It is a combined biochemical test which includes MSAFP, HCG and uE3 (unconjugated estriol). It is used for the detection of Down\u2019s syndrome . In an affected pregnancy, levels of MSAFP and uE3 tend to be low while that of HCG is high. It is performed for 15\u201322 weeks. It gives a risk ratio and for confirmation CVS/amniocentesis has to be done. Quadruple (Quad) Screening It includes four biochemical analytes: (1) Maternal Serum Alpha-Fetoprotein (MSAFP), (2) Unconjugated estriol (uE3), (3) dimeric inhibin-A and (4) hCG. The quad screen can detect trisomy 21. Levels of serum analytes in cases with trisomy 21: hCG\u2014increased; uE3\u2014reduced; inhibin A\u2014elevated; MSAFP\u2014reduced. Anomaly scan It is performed at 18-22 weeks. The anomaly scan allows the developing fetus to be observed in terms of morphology, bone shape, skeletal features, fetal heart function, volume evaluation, fetal lung maturity and general fetal well-being. A growth scan It is an ultrasound scan done during the last trimester of pregnancy to determine the growth of the baby.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Second-trimester quadruple screening Diagnosis MSAFP \u03b2B-hCG Estriol Inhibin A Trisomy 18 \u2b07 \u2b07 \u2b07 Normal Trisomy 21 \u2b07 \u2191 \u2b07 \u2191 Neural tube or abdominal wall defect \u2191 Normal Normal Normal</p>\n<p></p>",

Shoulder dystocia occurs when either the anterior or the posterior (rare) fetal impacts on the maternal symphysis or the sacral promontory. Management - the following manoeuvre are commonly employed: Head and neck should be grasped and taken posteriorly while supra-pubic pressure is applied by an assistant slightly towards the side of the fetal chest. This will reduce the bis acromial diameter and rotate the anterior shoulder towards the oblique diameter. McRoberts maneuver: abduct the maternal thighs and sharply flex them onto her abdomen. There is rotation of the symphysis pubis upwards and a decrease in the angle of pelvic inclination. This does not increase pelvic dimensions but straightens the sacrum relative to the lumbar vertebrae. Woods maneuver: the posterior shoulder is rotated to the anterior position (180 degrees) by a corkscrew movement. This is done by inserting two fingers in the posterior vagina. Simultaneous suprapubic pressure is applied. This pushes the bis acromial diameter from the anteroposterior diameter to an oblique diameter. This helps ease the entry of the bis acromial diameter into the pelvic inlet.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options A, C and D are false.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Other techniques - Cleidotomy - one or both clavicles may be cut with scissors</p>\n<p></p>",
