      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Typically appears as a cavitating tumor Histological classification of lung cancer: Small cell lung cancers were known as oat cell cancers because of the packed nature of small dense cells. They are a type of neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and represent about 20% of all lung cancers. They tend to metastasize early to lymph nodes and by blood-borne spread. The median survival is measured in months. The tumors are very responsive to chemotherapy such that median survival may be doubled (although it is still short) but they are rarely, if ever, cured. Surgery is rarely offered unless in very limited-stage disease. Adenocarcinoma is now the most common of the NSCLC types , having overtaken squamous cancer. The increasing incidence is partly due to an increased incidence in women and may be the result, in part, of a ward lower-tar cigarettes that are inhaled more deeply to get the same effect. Squamous carcinoma typically appears as a cavitating tumor. Large cell undifferentiated is a discrete histological type of NSCLC and is included within NETs .</p>\n<p></p>",

They tend to present in young adults and 75% are benign and cystic , although they may cause compression of neighboring structures; hence, dermoid cysts are best excised. Malignancy is suspected if elevated levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and carcinoembryonic antigen are detected.

They may be painful but are more often discovered accidentally on routine chest radiography and can be quite large. They include neuroblastoma in childhood , and Schwannomas and neurofibromas in adults , which are usually benign. Pheochromocytoma arises from the sympathetic chain and produces the characteristic endocrine syndrome.

Option: D. Lymphoma is a common cause of a mediastinal mass lesion, particularly in the anterior mediastinum, and can lead to superior vena cava obstruction or other symptoms of local compression.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 The raised 5-HIAA in 24Hr urine sample and the classical presentation points towards a Neuroendocrine Tumor. The abdominal symptoms can be caused by: Lymph node metastasis obstructing the mesenteric arteries. Obstructed appendix due to the tumor. Constriction of Mesenteric Arteries. Fibrosis of Mesentery. Obstruction of the bowel lumen.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Clinical presentation Chronic abdominal pain is common as the first symptom. Carcinoid syndrome appears in 20-30% with liver metastases. Involved lymph node metastases cause small bowel ischemia leading to pain and diarrhea by constricting the mesenteric vessels. Statement 1. Obstruction of the mesentery by the growth of lymph node metastases in the mesentery near the bowel Statement 2. Obstruction of the appendix by an appendiceal NET can lead to appendectomy. Statement 3. Chronic Bowel Ischemia can be caused by Constriction of Mesenteric Arteries. Statement 4. Chronic Bowel Ischemia can be caused by Fibrosis of The Mesentery by a so-called desmoplastic reaction. Statement 5. Obstruction of the bowel lumen by the growth of lymph node metastases in the mesentery near the bowel.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Chromogranin A often elevated, non-specific Elevated 24-hour urinary 5-HIAA is specific CT/MRI shows mesenteric lymph nodes with spiraling vessels, and detect liver metastases The biopsy is diagnostic, and Ki-67 grading is important for prognosis CT/MRI followed by 68Ga-DOTATOC PET to find the primary tumor Evaluate for Hedinger syndrome (right heart valve fibrosis)</p>\n<p></p>",
