Becomes more positive</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 In the given clinical scenario, the patient has hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can cause a shift in the resting membrane potential towards a more positive value, increased cell excitability, and impairments in membrane potential changes.</li><li>\u2022 Hyperkalemia can affect the resting membrane potential of cells, including neurons and muscle cells, in the following ways:</li><li>\u2022 Increased Resting Membrane Potential: Normally, the resting membrane potential is around -70 millivolts (mV) in neurons. However, in hyperkalemia, the elevated extracellular potassium concentration can lead to an increased positive charge outside the cell. This positive charge tends to depolarize the cell membrane, shifting the resting membrane potential towards a more positive value. Altered Excitability: The increased resting membrane potential caused by hyperkalemia can make the cell more excitable. It reduces the threshold required for an action potential to be initiated, making the cell more likely to depolarize and generate an action potential even in response to weaker stimuli. Impaired Membrane Potential Changes: Hyperkalemia can interfere with the ability of the cell membrane to depolarize and repolarize properly during an action potential. It reduces the electrochemical gradient for sodium (Na+) entry during depolarization and decreases the driving force for potassium (K+) exit during repolarization. This can result in slower and less efficient propagation of action potentials. Disrupted Ionic Balance: Elevated potassium levels can disrupt the balance of other ions, such as sodium and calcium, which are essential for normal cell function. The altered ionic balance can interfere with the proper functioning of ion channels and other membrane proteins involved in generating and regulating action potentials.</li><li>\u2022 Increased Resting Membrane Potential: Normally, the resting membrane potential is around -70 millivolts (mV) in neurons.

D) Increase in Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is determined by the balance of pressures acting on the glomerulus. The key pressures involved are the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, which drives filtration, and the oncotic pressure, which opposes it. Additionally, the hydrostatic pressure within Bowman's capsule also opposes filtration.</li><li>\u2022 Increase in Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure : This is the back pressure exerted by the fluid already in Bowman's capsule. If this pressure increases, it opposes the hydrostatic pressure of the glomerular capillaries, leading to a decrease in GFR. For example, conditions such as ureteric obstruction can increase this pressure, resulting in reduced GFR.</li><li>\u2022 Increase in Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Increase in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure : This pressure pushes fluid out of the capillaries and into Bowman's capsule, thus increasing GFR. Therefore, increasing this pressure would not decrease GFR.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Increase in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Decrease in glomerular capillary oncotic pressure : Oncotic pressure is the \"holding\" pressure due to plasma proteins. A decrease in this pressure would result in less opposition to filtration, thereby increasing GFR, not decreasing it.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Decrease in glomerular capillary oncotic pressure</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Increase in renal plasma flow : An increase in renal plasma flow generally leads to an increase in GFR because more plasma is being filtered through the kidneys.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

NSTEMI is typically caused by a subtotal occlusion of a coronary artery with a platelet-rich thrombus leading to ischemia. The initial management includes dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) such as aspirin and anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). These treatments help prevent further thrombus formation and reduce the risk of distal embolization.

This form of asthma typically develops in adulthood and is not linked to an atopic or allergic component. The pathophysiology involves a non-IgE-mediated mechanism with chronic inflammation driven by eosinophils and neutrophils. Nasal polyps in intrinsic asthma arise from persistent inflammation of the nasal passages and sinuses, contributing to the common symptoms of nasal obstruction and anosmia. This condition contrasts with allergic asthma, which usually involves IgE-mediated hypersensitivity.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

It peaks around 12 hours and normalizes within 24 hours. Due to its rapid rise, myoglobin is particularly useful in detecting myocardial infarction in the early hours when other biomarkers may still be within normal ranges. However, its lack of specificity to cardiac tissue means that while it is highly sensitive for early detection, it must be used in conjunction with other tests to confirm a diagnosis of MI.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Troponin T (TropT) Troponin T rises within 3 to 12 hours after myocardial infarction, peaking between 12 and 48 hours, and remains elevated for 7 to 10 days. It is highly specific for myocardial injury but is not an ideal early marker within the 2-4 hour window of symptom onset.</li><li>\u2022 Option</li><li>\u2022 D.

Troponins, while highly specific and sensitive for cardiac injury, typically begin to rise later, around 3 to 12 hours after symptom onset. Understanding the time courses of various biomarkers is crucial in selecting the appropriate tests for early diagnosis of myocardial infarction.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
