The LNG-IUS releases hormones that can thin the endometrial lining, reducing the symptoms of adenomyosis, such as heavy menstrual bleeding and pain. Option B. Contraception : One of the primary uses of LNG-IUS is contraception. It works by releasing levonorgestrel, a progestin, which thickens the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching an egg, thins the lining of the uterus, and partially suppresses ovulation. Option C. Endometrial Hyperplasia : LNG-IUS is used in the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia, a condition where the lining of the uterus becomes too thick. It is especially beneficial in cases without atypia, as it can reduce the proliferation of the endometrial cells, thereby reducing the risk of developing endometrial cancer. Asymptomatic Fibroid Uterus (Correct Answer): While LNG-IUS can help in managing symptoms of uterine fibroids such as heavy menstrual bleeding, its role in the management of an asymptomatic fibroid uterus is limited.</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Adenomyosis : Adenomyosis is a condition where the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium) breaks through the muscle wall of the uterus.

Option B: Vaginal Contraceptive Ring : The vaginal ring is a small, flexible ring that a woman inserts into her vagina. It releases estrogen and progestin, similar to combination oral contraceptives, but requires less frequent attention as it is typically changed monthly. It is a convenient and effective form of contraception. Option C: Progestin Implants : These are small rods implanted under the skin of the arm that release a steady dose of progestin.

Option D: Ulipristal Acetate (Correct Answer): Ulipristal acetate is used as an emergency contraceptive, not a regular method of contraception.

She should take the most recently missed pill as soon as possible (even if it means taking two pills in one day) and then continue with the rest of the pack as normal, without taking a 7-day pill-free break. Using an additional contraceptive method, like condoms, for the next 7 days is important to ensure protection against pregnancy.</li><li>\u2022 Option B</li><li>\u2022 Take the last missed pill as soon as possible, use additional contraceptive for 7 days, and omit the 7-day pill-free period</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

This approach helps maintain contraceptive protection and reduces the risk of pregnancy due to the missed pills.
