It is calculated as the average of the squared deviation scores of the distribution. Option D.

Based on ICMR, anaemia is divided into the following: Mild 10-10.9gm% Moderate 7-9.9gm% Severe <7gm% Very Severe <4gm% Management of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy: Oral preparation s : The dose is approximately 180-200 mg of elemental iron per day (equivalent to 3 tablets).The treatment is continued until blood parameters return to normal levels. The reticulocyte count is the earliest indicator of improvement. After that, a maintenance dose of one tablet per day is taken. The maintenance dose should be continued throughout the pregnancy and for three months after delivery to replenish iron stores. Parenteral preparation : Parenteral iron is indicated in patients on hemo/peritoneal dialysis, malabsorption syndrome, and pregnant females with severe anaemia that is seen for the first time during the last 8-10 weeks. The rise in haemoglobin concentration after parenteral therapy is similar to that with oral iron , approximately 7 to 1 gm % per week . Parenteral iron is not given for a rapid rise in haemoglobin concentration. The main advantage of parenteral therapy over oral iron is the certainty of administration.

Option C. Total fertility Rate is defined as the average number of children that would be born to a woman if she experiences the current fertility pattern throughout her reproductive span (15-49 years).
