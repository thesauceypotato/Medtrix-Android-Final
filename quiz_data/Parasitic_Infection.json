This can be done by sealing the items in a plastic bag for 2 weeks. All hairy areas of the body should be treated at the same time. Shaving is sometimes necessary when nits are plentiful.

It does not transfer any known pathogens or cause any diseases in humans. -It lives in bed mattresses, in the corners of beds, inside wallpapers, It is a common pest in homes, hotels, hospitals, shelters, and cruise ships. At night the insect feeds on exposed skin. Characteristics : The bite is painless . Therefore, it usually goes unnoticed by its human host. Minutes to days later, the blood-thinning saliva that it injects during feeding c reates wheels around the central punctum . Other symptoms caused by bed bug bites are irritation and severe pruritus. The latter is a major cause of sleep deprivation. The rash may be seen anywhere on the skin but usually involves more exposed areas such as the face, arms, and feet. Diagnosis : The diagnosis is clinical and can be confirmed by finding the insect. A stinky odor produced by bed bugs can be recognized in heavily infested rooms.
