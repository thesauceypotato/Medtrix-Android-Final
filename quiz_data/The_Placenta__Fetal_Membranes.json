Thus, supplementary iron therapy is needed for all pregnant mothers from 16 weeks onward</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option A. DIET: The diet during pregnancy should be adequate to provide: (a) good maternal health , (b) optimum fetal growth , (c) the strength and vitality required during labor and (d) successful lactation . During pregnancy, there is increased calorie requirement due to increased growth of the maternal tissues, fetus, placenta and increased basal metabolic rate. The increased calorie requirement is to the extent of 300 over the nonpregnancy state during second half of pregnancy. Option C. Coitus: Generally, coitus is not restricted during pregnancy. Release of prostaglandins and oxytocin with coitus may cause uterine contractions. Women with increased risk of miscarriage or preterm labor should avoid coitus if they feel such increased uterine activity. Option D. Travel: Travel by vehicles having jerks is better to be avoided, especially in first trimester and the last 6 weeks. The long journey is preferably to be limited to the second trimester. Rail route is preferable to bus route. Travel in pressurized aircraft is safe up to 36 weeks. Air travel is contraindicated in cases with placenta previa, preeclampsia, severe anemia and sickle cell disease .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>VALUES oF antEnataL Care : To counsel the women about the importance of regular checkup.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Immediate vaginal delivery or Cesarean section The given clinical scenario points towards vasa previa due to Vellamentous placenta. VELAMENTOUS PLACENTA: The cord is attached to the membranes. The branching vessels traverse between the membranes for a varying distance before they reach and supply the placenta. If the leash of blood vessels happens to traverse through the membranes over lying the internal os , in front of the presenting part, the condition is called vasa previa . Rupture of the membranes involving the overlying vessels leads to vaginal bleeding.

Blood transfusion may be required for the baby after evaluation of Hb . The blood lost due to vasa previa is fetal blood not maternal. Hence Option b) is wrong. Option C. Waiting for stoppage of bleeding may lead to fetal demise as fetal blood is lost due to vasa previa. Option D. Immediate delivery should be done to reduce morbidity and mortality of fetus. Monitoring pregnancy instead of delivery would lead to more fetal blood loss and death.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Apt test/Singers alkali denaturation test Principle: Fetal blood has fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and maternal blood has adult hemoglobin (HbA). HbF is resistant to acid and alkali denaturation (not HbA). therefore when water and blood are mixed with KOH/NaOH, it remains pink if blood is of fetal origin i.e. condition is vasa previa. If it is maternal blood it turns yellow brown in 2 minutes as HbA is denatured easily. i.e. condition is placenta previa.</p>\n<p></p>",
