Both clomipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant) and SSRIs are considered first-line pharmacological treatments for OCD.

While systematic desensitization (a type of exposure therapy) can be used in the treatment of specific phobias, the therapy of choice for OCD is Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), a type of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT).
