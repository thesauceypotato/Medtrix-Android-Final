Inhibition of PDE6 can produce visual disturbances, most notably changes in the perception of color hue or brightness.

Side effects, risks, contraindications, and drug interactions are similar to sildenafil. In addition, back pain is reported, which has been ascribed to some degree of PDE-2 inhibition by tadalafil. Side effects of PDE II: Muscle ache and back pain. Symptoms resembling the common cold Headache Flushing Less common side effects: MR, CHF, Cardiomyopathy Because of its longer-lasting action, nitrates are contraindicated for up to 3 days after tadalafil. Due to its lower affinity for PDE-6 , visual disturbances occur less frequently.
