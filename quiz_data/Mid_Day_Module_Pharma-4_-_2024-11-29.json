The risk of adverse effects is higher if the patient receives an overdose of morphine . Tachycardia is not a common adverse effect of morphine , and it is not expected to occur in response to an overdose. Rather bradycardia can be seen due to depression of cardiovascular centre in brain. Vomiting and retching are common adverse effects of morphine and can occur with an overdose. Respiratory depression is the most significant adverse effect of morphine and can be life-threatening in severe cases. Urinary retention is another common adverse effect of morphine that occurs due to the inhibition of bladder contractions.

It is the first FDA approved drug for anti-suicide indication. It is used only as a reserve drug due to the risk of precipitation of seizures ( even in non-epileptics ) and agranulocytosis. Convulsions are dose-dependent adverse effects seen only at higher doses whereas agranulocytosis is independent of dose.
