The first one-minute (\u201cthe Golden Minute\u201d) is the most crucial period wherein the baby is assessed for the need of resuscitation and reevaluated before ABC is initiated. The decision to progress beyond the initial steps is determined by simultaneous assessment of 2 vital characteristics: Respiratory rate and pattern of respiration \u2013 tachycardia, respiratory distress, labored breath-ing, apnoea, or gasping respiration, cyanosis. Heart rate - less than 100 beats per minute as recorded by auscultating the precordium.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The parameters to be looked at for successful resuscitation are: Oxygen saturation - as measured by continuous monitoring by pulse oximeter. The disadvantage of this non-invasive technique is that the peripheral perfusion must be good, the limbs must be warm and cardiac output must be appropriate for accurate reading. Capillary refill \u2013 a refill time of > 2 seconds is indicative of poor perfusion and need for further resuscitation Heart rate: A rise in heart rate is the most sensitive indicator of a successful response to the resuscitative techniques. An increase in heart rate should be evident by 5-10 breaths.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - Chest rise is more indicative of adequacy of ventilation and thus, when visible chest rise is seen bilaterally, ventilation can be started. Option C - Change in color does provide an idea about successful resuscitation but increase in heart rate remains the most important indicator.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>West Syndrome ACTH is the DOC in West syndrome. West syndrome is a constellation of symptoms characterized by epileptic/infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia and intellectual disability.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Symptoms associated with West syndrome usually begin during the first year of life. The spasms that occur may range from violent jackknife or \u201csalaam\u201d movements where the whole body bends in half, or they may be no more than a mild twitching of the shoulder or eye changes. These spasms usually begin in the early months after birth and can sometimes be helped with medication. They can also occur in older patients; if this happens, they are called \u201cepileptic spasms\u201d rather than infantile spasms. Infants with West syndrome also have very abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) with high amplitude, chaotic spike wave patterns (hypsarrhythmia). Most children will have regression of skills or delays in acquiring skills that require coordination of muscles and voluntary movements (psychomotor retardation). The syndrome often develops into Lennox-Gastaut syndrome with mixed types of seizures that are difficult to control and is associated with intellectual disability. Tx: DOC-ACTH DOC in patients of West syndrome associated with tuberous sclerosis: Vigabatrin</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), otherwise known as Janz syndrome and impulsive petit mal, is an idiopathic, hereditary, and generalized form of epilepsy. JME is characterized by the presence of absence, myoclonic, and generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures. Myoclonic seizures are the hallmark of this condition and are necessary for the diagnosis of JME. Only occasionally they will manifest as the only seizure type. They are described as brief, usually bilateral, jerking movements of the arms and sometimes legs with preservation of consciousness. The misdiagnosis of myoclonic seizures is possible as twitches or anxiety/nervousness. JME is relatively easy to control with anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs), and most patients respond to monotherapy. Valproic acid is the most effective medication and drug of choice for treatment of JME. If only absence seizures are present, ethosuximide can be a therapy choice. Clonazepam is effective against myoclonic jerks. Contraindicated agents include carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin (sodium channel blocking agents), given their potential to exacerbate myoclonic and absence seizures. But, they can be useful for the treatment of GTC seizures in JME. Option B: Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE), also called benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) or benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes (BECCT) is the most common epilepsy syndrome in children. Most of the affected children usually outgrow this condition by puberty, hence the term \"benign.\" The seizures originate in the Rolandic area of the brain (situated around the central sulcus of the brain, also called as centrotemporal area, located around the Rolandic fissure). Seizures are infrequent, partial (or focal) as they originate from the Rolandic area (which controls face and oropharynx) with no loss of consciousness. Symptoms are generally unilateral and include facial twitching and stiffness, numbness/tingling of the face and throat (tongue, lips, gums, the inner side of the cheek, tooth) that leads to difficulty speaking with gurgling noises, speech arrest, drooling, and hypersalivation. Seizures usually last only 2 to 3 minutes. Facial twitching can spread to the ipsilateral arm and leg. Treatment is considered if seizures are frequent, severe, happen during daytime, are generalized, associated with language and neurocognitive decline/changes, or learning disorder. Option D: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a rare but severe form of childhood epilepsy characterized by a triad of multiple seizure types, characteristic EEG findings, and intellectual impairment . Multiple seizure types are seen including tonic, atonic or drop attacks, atypical absence, myoclonic, and generalized tonic-clonic. Tonic seizures are most commonly seen, often occur at night, and are a distinctive feature of LGS. Atypical absence seizures are the second most common subtype seen in LGS. They differ from typical absence seizures in that they have more than just staring episodes associated with eye blinking. Continuous or video EEG monitoring can be helpful in identifying seizure types in this scenario. The initial growth in a child with LGS is unremarkable. The decline is seen only after the seizures start and is in the form of developmental delay, intellectual impairment, diminished learning abilities, and behavioral problems. Characteristic EEG Pattern: The background activity usually shows generalized slowing with bursts of spike and wave discharges (1.5 to 2.5 Hertz) and paroxysms of fast activity (10 to 20 Hertz). The spike and wave activity has the highest amplitude over the frontal region, can be periodic or continuous, and can be focal or generalized. Sleep EEG is very important as there are some electrographic features that are activated during sleep and/or seen exclusively during sleep. The goal of treatment in LGS is seizure control. Valproate, lamotrigine, and topiramate are considered first-line medications for LGS.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>West syndrome or infantile spasms is characterised by the triad of: Epileptic spasms (salaam spells), Hyps arrhythmic Electroencephalogram (given EEG) Psychomotor retardation or regression.</p>\n<p></p>",
