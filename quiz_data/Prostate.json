Coagulation of bleeding points can be accurately achieved. The \u2018chips\u2019 of the prostate are then removed from the bladder using an Ellik evacuator. Resection proceeds at 1 g/minute in experienced hands. Following TURP, careful hemostasis is performed. A three-way, self-retaining catheter rinsed with isotonic saline is introduced into the bladder to prevent further bleeding from forming blood clots.

Altered prostate architecture in conditions such as BPH, prostatitis, and prostate cancer allows PSA to enter the bloodstream and be detected by a blood test. The commonly used PSA assays measure the total PSA (tPSA) amount. PSA levels can be influenced by certain drugs, most notably 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors used to treat men with LUTS, but also by aspirin, statins, and thiazide diuretics. A recent UTI can significantly influence the PSA test, and the true PSA level only returns to baseline six weeks after eradication of infection . PSA in CA Prostate: It is good at following the course of the advanced disease but lacks sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing early localized prostate cancer. Nevertheless, a PSA >10 ng/mL finding suggests cancer, and > 35 ng/mL is almost diagnostic of advanced prostate cancer in the absence of active urinary tract infection. A decrease in PSA to the normal range following hormonal ablation is a good prognostic sign. Following radical prostatectomy, the serum PSA should fall to undetectable levels (the limit for detection for modern supersensitive assays is <0.03 ng/mL).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B.

A high PSAD increases the likelihood that the elevated PSA is due to malignancy and not the large gland alone. PSA kinetics involves measuring the rate of change of various forms of PSA based on the premise that a rapid increase or modification may be more predictive of cancer. PSA velocity is the annual absolute increase in tPSA; a value >0.75 ng/mL per year compared with baseline has been considered suspicious. PSA doubling time is the number of months for a baseline PSA to double .</p>\n<p></p>",

As the cell type becomes less differentiated, more solid sheets of carcinoma cells are seen. A classification of the histological pattern based on the degree of glandular dedifferentiation and its relation to stroma has been devised by Gleason. Prostate cancers exhibit heterogeneity within the tissue, and so two histological areas of the prostate are each scored between 3 and 5. Grades 1 and 2 are now not reported as their outcome is similar to grade 3. Grade 3 cancers rarely metastasize .
