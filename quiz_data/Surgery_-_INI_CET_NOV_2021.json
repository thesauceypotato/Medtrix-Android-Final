Testicular lymphoma is a rare and deadly disease representing 1% to 2% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) and approximately 5% of all testicular neoplasms. It is predominantly a disease of the elderly and is the most common testicular tumour in men over the age of 60. The usual presentation is a painless unilateral testicular mass or swelling, with bilateral disease present in some cases. The most common form of testicular lymphoma is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Secondary involvement of the testis by NHL is more common than primary extranodal disease. Staging is performed according to the Ann Arbor Staging system. Ann Arbor Staging System Stage Description I Involving a single lymph node region (1) or single extralymphatic organ or site (IE) II Two or more involved lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (II) or localized involvement of an extralymphatic organ or site (IIE) III Lymph node involvement on both sides of the diaphragm (III), or localized involvement of an extralymphatic organ or site (stage IIIE), or spleen (IIIS), or both (IIIES) IV The presence of diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs (e.g., liver, bone, marrow, lung), with or without associated lymph node involvement The presence or absence of systemic symptoms should be noted with each designation: A for asymptomatic, B for presence of fever, sweats or weight loss >10% of body weight.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>ICD tube The chest X-ray shows an elevated diaphragm on the left with mediastinal shift to the right; s/o traumatic (acquired) diaphragmatic rupture (TDR) from blunt force injury due to RTA. The bursting effect secondary to the sudden compression of the lower chest or upper abdomen causes a rent in the diaphragm with herniation of the abdominal contents into the chest cavity. In such cases, ICD insertion is contraindicated. Although uncommon, traumatic diaphragmatic rupture (TDR) from blunt force injury is difficult to diagnose and can lead to serious complications if left untreated. Associated symptoms are often non-specific, which can make detection of the injury difficult. The patient may present with pain &/or tenderness to palpation over the epigastrium. Strangulation of the herniated viscera is typically a late manifestation. Specific findings on the chest radiograph include intrathoracic herniation of a hollow viscus and visualization of the nasogastric tube above the left hemidiaphragm . Suggestive but nonspecific findings include apparent elevation, distortion, or obliteration of the diaphragmatic outline; abnormal lucencies adjacent to the diaphragm; and contralateral shift of the mediastinum . Less Common Radiologic Manifestations: Air fluid level within the herniated stomach. The diagnosis of TDR with herniation can be confirmed by computed tomography (CT). Here, diaphragmatic rupture (TDR) from blunt force injury is evident along with stomach herniation through the diaphragm. NOTE: Traumatic hemothorax may obscure traumatic hernias. Elevation of the hemidiaphragm due to phrenic nerve palsy or chronic eventration may mimic a traumatic hernia on the radiograph. In the majority of cases a confident diagnosis can be made on CT.</p>\n<p></p>",

Not all symptoms of disturbed voiding in ageing men should therefore be attributed to BPH causing BOO. Urologists prefer the term LUTS and discourage the use of the descriptive term \u2018prostatism\u2019. The following conditions can coexist with BOO, leading to difculty in diagnosis and in predicting the outcome of treatment: Idiopathic detrusor overactivity Neuropathic bladder dysfunction as a result of diabetes, stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s disease or Parkinson\u2019s disease Degeneration of bladder smooth muscle giving rise to impaired voiding and detrusor instability BOO due to BPH. LUTS can be described as: Voiding: hesitancy (worsened if the bladder is very full); poor fow (unimproved by straining); intermittent stream \u2013 stops and starts; dribbling (including after micturition); sensation of poor bladder emptying; episodes of near retention. Storage: frequency; nocturia; urgency; urge incontinence; nocturnal incontinence (enuresis). LUTS are usually assessed by means of scoring systems, which give a semiobjective measure of severity and may be helpful in assessing the outcome of the therapy. Severe irritative symptoms are usually associated with detrusor instability. Postmicturition dribbling is now known not to be a consequence of BOO and is not usually improved by prostatectomy. It is due to retained urine in the urethra .</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Categories of lower urinary tract symptoms Storage symptoms Urgency Nocturia Frequency Urinary incontinence Voiding symptoms Hesitancy Spraying Poor flow Intermittency Straining Terminal dribble Post-micturition Post-micturition dribble Feeling of incomplete emptying From National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (2010)</p>\n<p></p>",

It is commonly used for open appendicectomies . The incision is centred over McBurney\u2019s point two-thirds of the distance between the umbilicus and the right anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), where the base of the appendix is most likely to be found. This classically corresponds to the area of maximal tenderness on clinical examination when the appendix has become sufficiently inflamed to cause localised peritonitis. This incision may be modified to follow the horizontal Langer\u2019s lines for improved cosmesis. Disadvantages include the risk of injury to the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves.

Obstruction can result from various factors such as the presence of inspissated stool, lymphoid hyperplasia, or a vegetable matter plug . Obstruction causes an increase in pressure within the appendix, leading to inflammation, infection, and ultimately acute appendicitis. Other factors like infections, trauma, or tumors may also contribute to the development of appendicitis. Pain typically localizes to the right lower quadrant as the inflammatory process progresses and involves the parietal peritoneum overlying the appendix. Localized pain in the right lower quadrant is a classic pattern of migratory pain and is the most reliable symptom of acute appendicitis. Other symptoms may include vomiting, fever, and leukocytosis.

Surgical drains can be broadly classified into: Closed: Based on suction effect Open: Based on the principle of gravity Semiclosed: Based on capillary effect Also note: Jackson-Pratt drain - consists of a perforated round or flat tube connected to a negative pressure collection device. The collection device is typically a bulb with a drainage port which can be opened to remove fluid or air. After compressing the bulb to remove fluid or air, negative pressure is created as the bulb returns to its normal shape. Blake drain - a round silicone tube with channels that carry fluid to a negative pressure collection device. Drainage is thought to be achieved by capillary action, allowing fluid to travel through the open grooves into a closed cross section, which contains the fluid and allows it to be suctioned through the tube. Penrose drain - a soft rubber tube Negative pressure wound therapy - Involves the use of enclosed foam and a suction device attached; this is one of the newer types of wound healing/drain devices which promotes faster tissue granulation , often used for large surgical/trauma/non-healing wounds. Redivac drain - a high negative pressure drain. Suction is applied through the drain to generate a vacuum and draw fluids into a bottle. Pigtail drain - has an exterior screw to release the internal \"pigtail\" before it can be removed</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Current role of drain placement in non-gastrointestinal surgery Avoid routine drain placement Thyroid surgery Breast lumpectomy Inguinal hernia repair Consider routine drain placement Radical and modified radical neck dissection Parotid surgery Axillary dissection with or without mastectomy Inguinal lymphadenectomy Ventral hernia repair in obese patients Current role of drain placement in gastrointestinal surgery Avoid routine drain placement following Colonic surgery Small bowel resections Hepatic resections Cholecystectomy Consider routine drain placement following Oesophageal surgery Major pancreatic resection Selective use of drains following Rectal surgery Gastric resections</p>\n<p></p>",

Results of Pancreaticoduodenectomy for Pancreatic Cancer- Long-term survival, when the operation is performed for ductal adenocarcinoma, is unusual. Five-year survival rates of 15% to 20% have been reported from some centers, but rates of 10% to 15% are more common. Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most common genetic event in all human cancers, and it is observed in 75% of pancreatic cancers The risk of pancreatic cancer is higher with all forms of chronic pancreatitis . The lifetime risk for pancreatic cancer in patients with chronic pancreatitis is about 4%. The risk of pancreatic cancer is highest in patients with hereditary pancreatitis , particularly those who smoke.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Carcinoma Pancreas is a type of cancer that originates in the pancreas, with the most common type being pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The majority of PDAC cases occur in the head of the pancreas, with a smaller percentage occurring in the body and tail. During an examination, physicians should look for signs of jaundice, weight loss, a palpable liver, and a palpable gallbladder. Management: More than 85% of patients with ductal adenocarcinoma have advanced disease and are not suitable for resection. If imaging shows a potentially resectable tumor , surgical resection should be considered as it offers the only chance of a cure, albeit small. For patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease , the primary objective should be to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, and extend survival, rather than achieving a cure. Patients with pancreatic cancer fall into four categories: resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced and unresectable, and metastatic. Resectable patients should be offered surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Borderline resectable patients may be offered neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without chemoradiotherapy, followed by surgical resection if the disease has been downstaged. Adjuvant therapy should follow. Locally advanced and unresectable patient s should be offered systemic chemotherapy , with surgery being a possibility in a small cohort who get downstaged. Metastatic patients should be offered systemic chemotherapy. If a cystic tumor is encountered, regardless of size, surgical resection should be considered as it carries a reasonable chance of cure. Tumors of the ampulla have a good prognosis and should be resected if possible, as should some rare tumors and neuroendocrine lesions.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Courvoisier first noticed the association between an enlarged gallbladder and pancreatic tumors in 1890.

Perforated hollow viscus is characterized by loss of gastrointestinal wall integrity with subsequent leakage of enteric contents . Direct trauma or tissue ischemia and necrosis lead to full-thickness disruption of the gastrointestinal wall and perforation. Exposure of the normally sterile peritoneal cavity to intraluminal contents causes either a chemical peritonitis or secondary bacterial peritonitis. Proximal perforations can leak acidic gastric or caustic biliary or pancreatic secretions, and the resultant chemical peritonitis triggers a robust systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with the potential for rapid clinical deterioration. In contrast, distal perforations leak intraluminal contents that are more chemically inert, but that carry a high bacterial load. Their clinical course may be more insidious, with development of purulent or fecal peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess or phlegmon .

A diagnostic peritoneal lavage or laparoscopy may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis Emergency surgical intervention is required to repair the perforation and clean the peritoneal cavity. Antibiotics may also be administered to prevent or treat infection. Liver laceration Blunt or penetrating trauma to the abdomen, such as in a car accident or assault. Abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea and vomiting, and signs of shock. In severe cases, hemorrhagic shock may occur A CT scan or ultrasound is the preferred method for diagnosing liver lacerations. Blood tests may also be used to monitor liver function and detect signs of bleeding. Most liver lacerations heal on their own with supportive care, such as rest and pain management. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair the laceration or control bleeding. In some cases, a liver transplant may be required. Pneumothorax Trauma, such as a broken rib or punctured lung, or a spontaneous event Chest pain, shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and a rapid heartbeat. In severe cases, the affected side of the chest may appear smaller, and the trachea may shift away from the affected side A chest x-ray is the preferred method for diagnosing pneumothorax. CT scan or ultrasound may also be used. Arterial blood gas analysis may be performed to assess oxygen levels in the blood. Treatment may involve observation, oxygen therapy, or a procedure to remove air from the pleural space. In severe cases, a chest tube may be inserted to drain the air and allow the lung to re-expand. Surgery may be necessary in some cases to repair a punctured lung or prevent future pneumothorax Hemoperitoneum Trauma, such as a ruptured spleen or liver, or a bleeding disorder Abdominal pain and tendemess, distended abdomen, rapid breathing. rapid heartbeat, and signs of shock. In severe cases, the patient may lose consciousness A CT scan or ultrasound is the preferred method for diagnosing hemoperitoneum. Blood tests may also be used to detect signs of bleeding or anemia.
