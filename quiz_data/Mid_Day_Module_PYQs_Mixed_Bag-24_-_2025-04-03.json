Hirschsprung's disease : This is a congenital disorder in which nerve cells (ganglion cells) are absent from a segment of the bowel, usually the rectum or sigmoid colon, leading to a functional obstruction. Infants with Hirschsprung's typically have difficulty with bowel movements within the first days of life. The symptoms can include constipation, abdominal distension, and vomiting. It is diagnosed often in the neonatal period with a barium enema and confirmed with suction rectal biopsy showing the absence of ganglion cells.</li><li>\u2022 A.</li><li>\u2022 Hirschsprung's disease</li><li>\u2022 B. Posterior urethral valve (PUV) : PUV is a congenital malformation in male child where an abnormality of the posterior urethra prevents urine outflow. This can lead to urinary obstruction, distension of the bladder, and can subsequently cause damage to the kidneys. Common symptoms include weak urine stream, difficulty in urination, recurrent urinary tract infections, and failure to thrive. Diagnosis is usually made with a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG).</li><li>\u2022 B.</li><li>\u2022 Posterior urethral valve (PUV)</li><li>\u2022 C. Choledochal cyst : This is a congenital dilation of the bile ducts, often causing obstruction. Patients may present with the classic triad of abdominal pain, jaundice, and an abdominal mass, although not all these signs may be evident. Over time, choledochal cysts can lead to complications like cholangitis, pancreatitis, or even malignancy. Diagnosis is typically done with imaging like ultrasound or MRCP, and definitive treatment is surgical removal.</li><li>\u2022 C.</li><li>\u2022 Choledochal cyst</li><li>\u2022 D. Intussusception : This is a medical condition in which a part of the intestine telescopes into another section, leading to bowel obstruction. It is the most common cause of bowel obstruction in children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years. Symptoms include sudden, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and \"currant jelly\" stools (due to mucus and blood). The diagnosis can often be made with an ultrasound or CT abdomen showing the characteristic \"target sign\" and is typically treated with high pressure enema, although some cases may require surgical intervention.</li><li>\u2022 D.</li><li>\u2022 Intussusception</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
