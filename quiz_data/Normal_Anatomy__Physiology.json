      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>It is usually circumferential The key processes in atherosclerosis are intimal thickening and lipid accumulation , which together form plaques . Atheromatous plaques are white-yellow and encroach on the lumen of the artery ; the superimposed thrombus over ulcerated plaques is red-brown . Plaques vary in size but can coalesce to form larger masses. Atherosclerotic lesions are patchy , usually involving only a portion of any given arterial wall and are rarely circumferential ; on cross-section, the lesions, therefore, appear eccentric . Local flow disturbances, such as turbulence at branch points, make certain portions of a vessel wall more susceptible to plaque formation Atherosclerotic plaques are susceptible to clinically important pathologic changes. The thickness and ECM content of the overlying fibrous cap will impact the stability or fragility of the plaque and its tendency to undergo secondary changes. Rupture, ulceration, or erosion of the surface of atheromatous plaques exposes the bloodstream to highly thrombogenic substances and leads to thrombosis , which can partially or completely occlude the vessel lumen . If the patient survives, the thrombus may organize and become incorporated into the growing plaque. Haemorrhage into a plaque . Rupture of the overlying fibrous cap or the thin-walled vessels in the areas of neovascularization can cause intraplaque haemorrhage; a contained hematoma may expand the plaque or induce plaque rupture . Atheroembolism . Plaque rupture can discharge atherosclerotic debris into the bloodstream, producing microemboli . Aneurysm formation . Atherosclerosis-induced pressure or ischemic atrophy of the underlying media, with loss of elastic tissue, causes weakness and potential rupture.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis: Endothelial injury and dysfunction, cause (among other things) increased vascular permeability, leukocyte adhesion, and thrombosis . Accumulation of lipoproteins (mainly LDL and its oxidized forms) in the vessel wall. Monocyte adhesion to the endothelium, followed by migration into the intima and transformation into macrophages and foam cells . Platelet adhesion . Factor release from activated platelets, macrophages, and vascular wall cells, inducing smooth muscle cell recruitment , either from the media or from circulating precursors. Smooth muscle cell proliferation , ECM production , and recruitment of T cells. Lipid accumulation both extracellularly and within cells (macrophages and smooth muscle cells). Calcification of ECM and necrotic debris late in the pathogenesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.

Beneath and to the side of the cap (the \u201c shoulder \u201d) is a more cellular area containing macrophages, T cells, and smooth muscle cells. Deep to the fibrous cap is a necrotic core , containing lipid (primarily cholesterol and cholesterol esters), debris from dead cells, foam cells (lipidladen macrophages and smooth muscle cells), fibrin, variably organized thrombus, and other plasma proteins; the cholesterol content is frequently present as crystalline aggregates that are washed out during routine tissue processing and leave behind only empty \u201cclefts.\u201d The periphery of the lesions demonstrates neovascularization (proliferating small blood vessels).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.

True .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Arteriosclerosis literally means \u201c hardening of the arteries \u201d; it is a generic term for arterial wall thickening and loss of elasticity. There are four general patterns , with different clinical and pathologic consequences. Arteriolosclerosis affects small arteries and arterioles and may cause downstream ischemic injury. There are two anatomic variants, hyaline and hyperplastic . M\u00f6nckeberg medial sclerosis is characterized by calcifications of the medial walls of muscular arteries, typically starting along the internal elastic membrane. Adults older than age 50 are most commonly affected. The calcifications do NOT encroach on the vessel lumen and are usually not clinically significant . Fibromuscular intimal hyperplasia occurs in muscular arteries larger than arterioles. It is driven by inflammation (as in a healed arteritis or transplant-associated arteriopathy) or by mechanical injury (e.g., associated with stents or balloon angioplasty; see later) and can be considered as a healing response. The affected vessels can become quite stenotic; indeed, such intimal hyperplasia underlies in-stent restenosis and is the major long-term limitation of solid-organ transplants. Atherosclerosis , from Greek root words for \u201cgruel\u201d and \u201chardening,\u201d is the most frequent and clinically important pattern and is discussed here.</p>\n<p></p>",
