      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Ploucquet\u2019s test The blood flow in the lung beds is so increased after breathing that their weight I almost doubled from 1/70 of the body weight before respiration to 1135 after respiration. The increase in weight is not constant and is not a reliable indication of breathing.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Wredin\u2019s Test- Before birth, the middle ear contains gelatinous embryonic connective tissue but no air. With respiration, the sphincter at the pharyngeal end of eustachian tube relaxes and air replaces the gelatinous substances in few hours to five weeks. The middle ear must be opened underwater by removing tegmen tympani. A bubble of air comes out if the test is positive. Option: B. Fodere\u2019s Test or Static Test: Lungs are ligated across their hila and separated. The average weight of both lungs before respiration varies from 30 to 40 g., and after respiration from 60 to 66 g. The increase in weight is due to the increased flow of blood. Option: D. Raygat\u2019s Test- It is based on the fact that the volume of lung is increased on breathing which more than compensates the weight of the additional blood due to which their specific gravity is diminished. The specific gravity of lungs before respiration varies from 1040 to 1050 and about 940 after breathing.</p>\n<p></p>",
