She takes a multivitamin and a supplement containing 600 mg calcium carbonate and 200 international units of vitamin D twice daily. She takes no prescription medications. Physical examination is unremarkable for her age. In completing the appropriate screening tests, you order a dual-x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) to evaluate whether the patient has osteoporosis. DEXA results reveal a T-score of \u20133.0 at the total hip and \u20132.7 at the femoral neck (osteoporosis: less than \u20132.5). Since her Z-score is \u20132.0, you proceed with an evaluation of secondary osteoporosis.
