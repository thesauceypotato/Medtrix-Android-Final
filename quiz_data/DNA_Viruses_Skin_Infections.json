Primary VZV infection occurs most commonly in childhood. Inoculation in the nasopharyngeal mucosa is followed by migration of the virus to the regional lymphatics. Subsequent dermatotrophic migration produces a diffuse vesicular rash associated with fever, malaise, and pharyngitis ( chickenpox ). Then, the virus migrates via sensory nerves to the cranial nerve and dorsal spinal ganglia, where it lies dormant for decades. Most patients who have had primary chickenpox do not develop recurrent diffuse disease. Over time, however, waning cell-mediated immune function allows reactivation of the virus, which typically spreads down a single spinal nerve to cause a painful, erythematous, vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution. The primary risk factor for reactivation is increasing age; other factors can include malignancy, autoimmune disease, and immune-suppressing therapy. The varicella vaccine is recommended for the prevention of primary disease in children, women of childbearing age, adults with sustained risk of exposure, and household contacts of immunocompromised hosts. The zoster vaccine is recommended for adults age d >50 and reduces the risk of reactivation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Colonization of the skin by transient flora (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida species, gram-negative bacilli occasionally leads to clinical disease, especially following antibiotic exposure (eg, vaginal candidiasis).

Primary VZV infection (ie, chickenpox) can be acquired by direct contact or airborne aerosol from patients with active chickenpox or zoster lesions . However, primary VN infection causes diffuse lesions, and lesions in a dermatomal distribution are seen only with reactivation from the sensory ganglia.</p>\n<p></p>",

Enterovirus, particularly group B coxsackievirus, is the most common cause of viral meningitis in children.

Naegleria fowleri is a free-living, protozoan parasite that causes rapid meningoencephalitis with a high mortality rate. N fowleri is found in freshwater, and transmission occurs through nasal inhalation during recreational activities (eg, swimming, diving). After spreading through the cribriform plate to the olfactory cortex, infection leads to symptoms of encephalitis, as described above, in addition, to smell and taste abnormalities. Inflammation can be seen in the frontal and temporal lobes, brainstem, and meninges. Option D.

Definitive diagnosis is made by polymerase chain reaction testing of cerebrospinal fluid. Symptoms of acute encephalitis include acute onset of headache, fever, mental status changes (eg, lethargy, disorientation), cranial nerve deficits (eg, Bell's palsy), and seizures.

Recurrent HSV-1 infection causes lip lesions that are typically less severe due to existing cellular and humeral immunity from prior infection. HSV-1 and other herpesviruses are enveloped and possess double-stranded DNA genomes. Transmission is usually by direct contact with infected oral secretions or lesions. Inoculation occurs on mucosa or skin where the virus replicates rapidly in the host cell nucleus and causes abnormal cell division, resulting in intranuclear inclusion bodies and multinucleated giant cells visible on the Tzanck smear.

Coxsackie A viruses cause aseptic meningitis and herpangina (fever, posterior pharyngeal grey vesicles/ulcers) in children. Option C. Most cases of infectious mononucleosis (IM), caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are associated with serum heterophile antibodies that agglutinate with erythrocytes from unrelated species (eg, horse erythrocytes in the Monospot test, sheep erythrocytes in the classic Paul Bunnell test). The agglutination test may be negative at the beginning of the infection and can be repeated later for confirmation. Because the Monospot (horse erythrocyte agglutination) test was negative on 2 separate occasions in this patient with a mononucleosis-like syndrome (fever, fatigue, splenomegaly, atypical lymphocytosis), his symptoms are unlikely to be due to EBV Epstein\u2013Barr; the lack of sore throat and lymphadenopathy is also atypical for classic EBY-associated IM. Option D. Acute hepatitis C (HCV) rarely causes symptoms.

Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes varicella (chickenpox). Primary infection with VZV causes varicella. Varicella (chickenpox) is an acute infectious disease. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which is a DNA virus that is a member of the herpesvirus group. Option B. After the primary infection, VZV stays in the body (in the sensory nerve ganglia) as a latent infection. Primary infection with VZV causes varicella. Option D. Varicella is characterized by fever concurrent with a self-limiting rash on the skin and sometimes mucosa. The rash begins as macules, and rapidly progresses to papules, followed by a vesicular stage and crusting of lesions. Varicella is a disease of children, whereas zoster is a disease of elderly and immunosuppressed patients Herpes zoster usually begins with a prodromal phase characterized by pain, itching, paresthesias (numbness or tingling), dysesthesias (unpleasant sensations), or sensitivity to touch (allodynia) in one to three dermatomes. So, Options A, B and D. Are the correct options.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Varicella (chickenpox) Fig 1 Varicella (chickenpox) is a mild, highly contagious disease, chiefly in children, characterized clinically by a generalized vesicular eruption of the skin and mucous membranes. The disease may be severe in adults and immunocompromised individuals. Herpes zoster (shingles) Fig 2 is a sporadic, disease of elderly or immunocompromised individuals that is characterized by pain and vesicular rash along the distribution to the skin innervated by a single sensory ganglion. The lesions are similar to those of varicella. Both diseases are caused by the same virus. Whereas varicella is an acute disease due to primary contact with the virus, zoster is the response of the partially immune host to reactivation of varicella virus present in latent form in neurons in sensory ganglia.</p>\n<p></p>",
