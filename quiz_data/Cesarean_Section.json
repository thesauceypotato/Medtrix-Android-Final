      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>B In the given question as mentioned the previous indication for the C-section was a major degree of anterior placenta previa (completely) with placenta attached to the anterior uterine wall is an indication for a classical C- section , hence the correct answer for this question will be classical uterine incision. This is depicted by image D. Previous classical cesarean is an absolute contraindication to TOLAC/ VBAC , but is not an indication for repeat cesarean.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Caesarean section, also known as C-section or caesarean delivery, is the surgical procedure by which one or more babies are delivered through an incision in the mother's abdomen, often performed because vaginal delivery would put the baby or mother at risk. Reasons for the operation include obstructed labour, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, and problems with the placenta or umbilical cord. Caesarean delivery may be performed based on the shape of the mother's pelvis or the history of a previous C-section. A trial of vaginal birth after a C-section may be possible. The World Health Organization recommends that caesarean section be performed only when medically necessary. Most C-sections are performed without a medical reason, upon request by someone, usually the mother.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Cesarean section Two main principles in the management of obstructed labour are: Never wait and watch Never use oxytocin In the case of obstructed labour there is a problem with either the passage or the passenger but the uterus contracts adequately , so if we increase uterine contractions by giving oxytocin it will lead to uterine rupture. Oxytocin should be used in cases of prolonged labour where there are hypotonic uterine contractions. Management of obstructed labour: Management of dehydration - by giving IV fluids Antibiotics are given to prevent infection The most important step is to relieve obstruction by either instrumental delivery or by doing LSCS LSCS may even have to be done if the baby is dead to relieve the obstruction otherwise uterine rupture can occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A & B. Craniotomy and decapitation are not done in modern obstetrics . These were practised earlier. Option: D. The baby is invariably dead in most of the neglected cases and destructive operation is the best choice to relieve the obstruction . If, however, the head is low down and vaginal delivery is not risky, forceps extraction may be done in a living baby.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Oxytocin should be used in cases of prolonged labour where there are hypotonic uterine contractions. There is no place for internal versions in obstructed labour . After completion of the delivery and expulsion of the placenta, exploration of the uterus and the lower genital tract should be done to exclude uterine rupture or tear.</p>\n<p></p>",

Artery Forceps: The main uses of artery forceps are for controlling bleeding and for the retraction of tissues, skin, etc. Artery forceps are otherwise called haemostatic forceps. The hemostat is used to block the flow of blood and tips close the blood vessels. It's also used to hold the tissue and skin. Green Armytage Forceps: A Green Armytage uterine haemostatic forceps are used to hold the incised uterine edges at caesarean section prior to closing the hysterotomy incision. Four are commonly used, one on each side of the uterine incision angle. Sponge-Holding Forceps: Sponge-holding forceps are used during surgical procedures to hold sponges. They have a ratchet mechanism towards the handles and have looped serrated jaws. It is also used to hold swabs for painting the area before operation. Allis Tissue Forceps: Allis forceps are ratcheted. They have hinged teeth and are used to hold or grasp heavy tissue. They can be used to hold soft tissues without causing damage for long periods. It is also used to grasp fascia and soft tissues such as breast or bowel tissue. Needle Holders: Needle holders have a clamp mechanism that locks the needle in place. This allows the user to manoeuvre the needle through various tissues. In order to maintain a firm grip on the needle, the jaws are textured and short compared to the handles. Doyen Retractors: Doyens are used at the caesarean section for retracting the bladder away from the incision site on the uterus and guarding it against potential injury when suturing. They are usually removed prior to delivery of the baby and reinserted after delivery to allow a good view of the lower edge of the hysterotomy. Langenbeck Retractors: Langenbeck Retractors are light retractors and are used to retract skin during the closure of the rectus sheath at caesarean section and laparotomy. They can be used in pairs, one in each of the assistant\u2019s hands . Morris Retractors: The Morris and Balfour Retractors are two examples of commonly used retractors in pelvic surgery. The Balfour retractor is self-retaining and need not be held once it is inserted, freeing the assistant\u2019s hands. Mayo Scissors: Mayo Scissors are broadly classified into dissecting or suture scissors. Dissecting or tissue-cutting scissors are usually curved and heavy. They are used when a surgeon needs to cut through tough scar tissue.
