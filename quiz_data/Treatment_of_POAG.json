Sondermann\u2019s channels were also suggested to be responsible for the aqueous outflow of the inner wall of Schlemm\u2019s canal. Option: D. Vacuolation theory was one of the most accepted views till the recent past. According to it, transcellular spaces exist in the endothelial cells forming the inner wall of Schlemm\u2019s canal. These open as a system of vacuoles and pores, primarily in response to pressure, and transport the aqueous from the juxta canalicular connective tissue to Schlemm\u2019s canal.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Functions of Aqueous Humour : Maintainance of IOP.

Beta-aminopropionitrile fumarate , an inhibitor of collagen cross-linking, is used topically in patients after filtration surgery for difficult cases of glaucoma (aphakic, repeat surgery, neovascular). Inhibition of collagen cross-linking may represent an alternative method to the use of injectable 5-fluorouracil to maintain the patency of filtration blebs. Option: B. If scar tissue blocks the exit of the surgically created channel, intraocular pressure rises and the operation fails. Antimetabolites such as 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) are used to inhibit wound healing to prevent the conjunctiva from scarring down onto the sclera. Option: C.
