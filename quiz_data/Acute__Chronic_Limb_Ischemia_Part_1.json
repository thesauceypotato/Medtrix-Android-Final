ALI typically occurs as a result of embolic arterial occlusion or trauma, but less common causes, including thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysm and popliteal artery entrapment, should be kept in mind during patient assessment Clinical Features :- Five P\u2019s : Pain, Pallor, Paresthesia, Paralysis, and Pulselessness The skin is initially cold and pale , but as time progresses it slowly becomes mottled; first, non-fixed (blanching to pressure) and then fixed (non-blanching), indicating skin death. Neurological function deteriorates with time, progressing from paraesthesia to eventual complete loss of sensory and motor function, causing an insensate and paralyzed limb (a poor prognostic sign). Muscle groups are weakened and painful; manual compression of affected muscle groups may cause pain owing to ischemia-induced injury \u2013 rhabdomyolysis Pulses are absent distally but the femoral pulse may be palpable , even thrusting, as distal occlusion results in forceful expansion of the artery with each pressure wave despite the lack of flow Investigations : ECG Creatinine Kinase RFT Imaging - DUS or CTA Treatment : Immediate Administration - 5000U of heparin IV Embolectomy Thrombolysis</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- : Option: B.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Neurological Neurogenic claudication occurs due to lumbar cord stenosis. The spine extends in the downhill walk with the narrowing of the spinal canal and pain increases. When symptoms mimicking the symptoms of intermittent vascular claudication arise from lumbar canal stenosis, the condition is termed neurogenic pseudo-claudication. Pseudo-claudication refers to a variety of conditions that may mimic vascular intermittent claudication. The condition that is most commonly confused with vascular intermittent claudication is neurological pseudo-claudication due to lumbar canal stenosis Common in both males and females (no predisposition) Pain reduces on flexed posture/ position Pain Increases on Walking downhill and Decreases on Downhill Walk</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Claudication : Intermittent claudication occurs as a result of anaerobic muscle metabolism and is classically described as debilitating cramp-like pain felt in the muscles that are: brought on by walking; not present on taking the first step (unlike osteoarthritis); relieved by rest in both the standing and sitting positions, usually within 5 minutes (unlike nerve compression from lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse or osteoarthritis of the spine or spinal stenosis, which are typically relieved only when resting in the sitting position for longer than 5 minutes). The distance that a patient is able to walk without stopping varies (claudication distance) only slightly from day to day. It is decreased, first, by increasing the work demands and hence oxygen requirements of the muscles affected, e.g. walking uphill, increasing the speed of walking and/or carrying heavy weights, and, second, by general health conditions that reduce the oxygen delivery capacity of the arterial system, e.g. anemia or cardiorespiratory disease. The muscle group affected by claudication is classically one anatomical level below the level of arterial disease and is usually felt in the posterior calf as the superficial femoral artery is the most commonly affected artery (70% of cases). Aortoiliac disease (30% of cases) may cause thigh or buttock claudication Leriche\u2019s syndrome is buttock claudication combined with sexual impotence, which is secondary to arterial insufficiency</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Only one-quarter of patients presenting with intermittent claudication will experience symptomatic deterioration during their lifetime and the overall risk of progression to CLTI and amputation is small, with <5% of patients requiring amputation over a 5-year period.</p>\n<p></p>",

This preference is applicable not only for the initial bypass but also for re-operative cases. For long bypasses, the ipsilateral great saphenous vein, contralateral great saphenous vein, small saphenous vein, arm vein, and spliced vein are used in decreasing order of preference. If only a short segment of vein is missing, the SFA can be endarterectomized and the proximal anastomosis performed distally to decrease the length of the conduit and to avoid harvesting and splicing additional vein. When the great saphenous vein is not available and a relatively short bypass is necessary, the arm vein or small saphenous vein is effective. The small saphenous vein is of particular utility when a posterior approach is used. If a longer bypass with vein is necessary, the arm vein is preferable because it is less awkward to harvest. Another conduit alternative is to harvest the upper arm basilic, median cubital, and cephalic veins in continuity, while incising valves in the basilic segment and using the cephalic segment in reversed configuration to provide a relatively long, unspliced autogenous conduit.</p>\n<p></p>",

There is abnormal sensitivity in the arteriolar response to cold. These vessels constrict and the digits (usually the fingers) turn white and become incapable of fine movements. The capillaries then dilate and fill with slowly flowing deoxygenated blood, resulting in the digits becoming swollen and dusky. As the attack passes off, the arterioles relax, oxygenated blood returns to the dilated capillaries and the digits become red. Thus, the condition is recognized by the characteristic sequence of blanching, dusky cyanosis, and red engorgement, often accompanied by pain. Superficial necrosis is very uncommon. This condition must be distinguished from Raynaud\u2019s syndrome, which has similar features and is the term most often used for a Peripheral arterial manifestation of collagen disease. Treatment : Raynaud\u2019s disease consists of protection from colds and avoidance of pulp and nail bed infections. Calcium antagonists, such as nifedipine, may also have a role to play and electrically heated gloves can be useful in winter. Sympathectomy has been used in the past but it is either ineffective or its effects are short-lived.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Raynaud\u2019s Syndrome has clinical features same as Raynaud\u2019s disease but they may be much more aggressive. Acrocyanosis may be confused with Raynaud\u2019s disease but it is painless and not episodic.</p>\n<p></p>",

The size of the needle will be dictated by the diameter of the guide wire used. Most often, an 18-gauge needle is used, as it will accept a 0.035-inch guidewire. A 21-gauge micropuncture needle will accept a 0.018- inch guidewire. The most popular access needle is the Seldinger needle, which can be used for single- and double-wall puncture techniques. Femoral arterial puncture is the most common site for access. The common femoral artery (CFA) is punctured over the medial third of the femoral head, which is landmarked using fluoroscopy. The single-wall puncture technique requires a sharp, bevelled needle tip and no central stylet. The anterior wall of the vessel is punctured with the bevel of the needle pointing up, and pulsatile back-bleeding indicates an intraluminal position. This method is most useful for graft punctures, patients with abnormal clotting profiles, or if thrombolytic therapy is anticipated. Once the needle assumes an intraluminal position, verified by pulsatile back-bleeding, the guidewire may be advanced. This is always passed gently and under fluoroscopic guidance to avoid subintimal dissection or plaque disruption. Double-wall puncture techniques are performed with a blunt needle that has a removable inner cannula. The introducer needle punctures both walls of the artery and is withdrawn until bleeding is obtained to confirm intraluminal position prior to advancing a guidewire. There can be troublesome bleeding from the posterior arterial wall puncture; therefore, single puncture techniques are preferred. Retrograde femoral access is the most common arterial access technique.</p>\n<p></p>",
