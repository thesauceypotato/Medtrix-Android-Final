Hypersensitivity reactions such as rashes, fever, abdominal pain, bowel upset, and flu-like respiratory & constitutional symptoms occur in 2\u20135% of adult patients & are the major problems. A genetic basis & massive release of TNF\u03b1 have been related to this reaction. HLA 5701 association has been seen. Abacavir should never be given again to a patient who has developed this reaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Tenofovir is the only nucleotide analogue that is a commonly used anti-HIV drug. It has a good tolerability profile & hence it is included in the preferred 1st line WHO regimen for adults & adolescents. Tenofovir-containing regimens have been found less toxic than other first-line Renal toxicity is to be watched. Option: B . Emtricitabine is a cytidine analogue which is converted intracellularly by cellular kinases into its triphosphate which acts as the HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor. It is one of the least toxic ARV drugs; side effects are fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhoea & discolouration of exposed skin. Dose reduction is needed for renal impairment. Option: D . Lamivudine inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase & results in chain termination. It is well tolerated & has a good safety profile, because of which it is accorded high priority in use for HIV. Side effects are headache, fatigue, rashes, nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain.</p>\n<p></p>",

Entry inhibitors are used to treat conditions such as HIV and hepatitis D</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Enfuvirtide is an entry (fusion) inhibitor which acts by binding to HIV-1 envelope transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) which is involved in the fusion of viral & cellular membranes. Fusion of the two membranes is thus prevented & entry of the virus into the cell is blocked. It is not active against HIV-2. Administered SC twice daily, it is used as an add-on drug to an optimized regimen in selected patients who have failed many earlier regimens/ have multidrug-resistant HIV & for whom there is no other treatment option. The injections are painful & cause local nodules/cysts. The cost & inconvenience are prohibitive and thus, it is not used in routine clinical practice.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A . CCR5 receptor inhibitor CCR5 receptor antagonists are a class of small molecules that antagonize the CCR5 receptor. The C-C motif chemokine receptor CCR5 is involved in the process by which HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, enters cells. Hence antagonists of this receptor are entry inhibitors and have potential therapeutic applications Option: B. Integrase inhibitor Integrase inhibitors (INIs) are a class of antiretroviral drug s designed to block the action of integrase, a viral enzyme that inserts the viral genome into the DNA of the host cell. Since integration is a vital step in retroviral replication, blocking it can halt the further spread of the virus. Option: D. Protease inhibitors are medications that act by interfering with enzymes that cleave proteins. Some of the most well-known are antiviral drugs widely used to treat HIV/AIDS hepatitis C and COVID-19. These protease inhibitors prevent viral replication by selectively binding to viral proteases (e.g. HIV-1 protease)</p>\n<p></p>",
