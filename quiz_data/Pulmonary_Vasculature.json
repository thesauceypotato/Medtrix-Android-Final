      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pulmonary vascular resistance increases In this case, Pulmonary vascular resistance will be increased. The increased pulmonary vascular resistance seen at total lung capacity (TLC) is due to an increase in the resistance of the alveolar vessels (pulmonary capillaries) caused by compression by the high alveolar volume. The increased pulmonary vascular resistance seen at residual volume is due to an increase in the resistance of the extra-alveolar vessels caused by compression by the positive intrapleural pressure generated during forced expiration.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) varies with lung volume. PVR is lowest at functional residual capacity and increases at both high and low lung volumes. As lung volume increases toward TLC, the compliance of the lungs (slope of the pressure-volume curve) decreases and elastic recoil of the lung increases, that is, the lungs resist further expansion. Intrapleural pressure becomes more sub-atmospheric during inspiration, approaching \u201330 cm H2O at TLC; as a result, the transmural pressure across the intrathoracic airways (Pin-Pout) increases, which increases airway radius, and decreases airway resistance according to Poiseuille\u2019s law.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The amount of air that moves into the lungs with each inspiration (or the amount that moves out with each expiration) during quiet breathing is called the tidal volume (TV). Typical values for TV are on the order of 500\u2013750 mL. The air inspired with a maximal inspiratory effort in excess of the TV is the inspiratory reserve volume (IRV; \u223c2 L). The volume expelled by an active expiratory effort after passive expiration is the expiratory reserve volume (ERV; \u223c1 L), and the air left in the lungs after a maximal expiratory effort is the residual volume (RV; \u223c1.3 L). When all four of the above components are taken together, they make up the total lung capacity (TLC, \u223c5 L). The TLC can be broken down into alternative capacities that help define functioning lungs. The vital capacity (VC, \u223c3.5 L) refers to the maximum amount of air expired from the fully inflated lungs, or maximum inspiratory level (this represents TV + IRV + ERV). The inspiratory capacity (IC, \u223c2.5 L) is the maximum amount of air inspired from the end-expiratory level (IRV + TV). The functional residual capacity (FRC; \u223c2.5 L) represents the volume of the air remaining in the lungs after the expiration of a normal breath (RV + ERV).</p>\n<p></p>",
