      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Most important toxin is hyaluronidase The most important virulence factor is the toxin known as Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), while the biological properties of this bacterium also contribute to the induction of foodborne disease. Perfringens produce toxins that kill cells and release gas, leaving parts of the body black, purple, and covered with blisters. Alpha toxin (or lecithinase or phospholipase C) is the principal virulence factor for gas gangrene.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Gas gangrene is most commonly caused by the Clostridium perfringens bacterium. The infection occurs suddenly and spreads quickly. Gas gangrene generally develops at a recent surgery or injury site. Bacteria cause myonecrosis. These microorganisms are opportunistic and, in general, enter the body through significant skin breakage Option B. Gas gangrene has positive naegler reaction. Option D. The C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) mediating the disease is heat-labile (inactivated at 74 \u00b0C (165 \u00b0F)). It can be detected in contaminated food (if not heated properly), and feces. Incubation time is between 6 and 25 (commonly 10\u201312) hours after ingestion of contaminated food.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Toxins of clostrium perfringens The alpha toxin - lecithinase, and its lethal action are proportionate to the rate at which it splits lecithin (an important constituent of cell membranes) to phosphorylcholine and diglyceride. The alpha toxin also aggregates platelets, thereby leading to the formation of thromb i in small blood vessels causing poor tissue profusion and extending the consequences of anaerobiosis, i.e. gas gangrene. The theta toxin has hemolytic and necrotizing effects but is not a lecithinase. It is a member of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins that act by forming pores in cell membranes. Epsilon toxin is a protein that causes edema, and haemorrhage is very potent. DNase and hyaluronidase, a collagenase that digests collagen of subcutaneous tissue and muscle, are also produced. Lecithinase test or Nagler's reaction Is a biochemical test used to identify organisms that liberate phospholipases (lecithinases) e.g. Clostridium perfringens. Options A, B and D.

The incubation period of C.perfringens is 10-48 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Gas Gan g rene Aetiology and pathogenesis Gas gangrene occurs by muscle injury and contamination of the wound by soil or foreign material containing clostridial spores. C. perfringens is the predominant cause (80\u2013 95%), and its pathology is mediated by \u03b1 and \u03bb toxins. Spontaneous or non-traumatic gas gangrene may occur in any obvious absence wound. Mainly caused by C. septicum and is seen with intestinal abnormalities, e.g. colonic cancer, diverticulitis, etc. Other organisms include C. novyi, C. bifermentans, C. histolyticum, and C. fallux. Clinical features The incubation period is usually 2\u2013 3 days but may be shorter. Patients present with acute onset of excruciating pain and signs of shock. Early signs- Local oedema and tenderness and a serosanguinous, foulsmelling discharge, crepitus (due to the gas formation), skin discolouration, and necrosis, associated with rapid progression. Diagnosis Is usually clinical but may be confirmed by Gram stain of the wound or aspirate. Liquid anaerobic cultures may be positive within 6h. Plain radiographs may show gas in the affected tissues. Management Emergency surgical exploration and debridement of the affected area should be performed. The definitive treatment for clostridial myonecrosis is with penicillin and clindamycin.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A.
