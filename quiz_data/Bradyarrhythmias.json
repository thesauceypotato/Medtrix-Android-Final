      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Bezold\u2013Jarisch reflex CARDIOPULMONARY CHEMOSENSITIVE RECEPTORS Activation of chemosensitive vagal C fibers in the cardiopulmonary region (e.g., juxta capillary region of alveoli, ventricles, atria, great veins, and pulmonary artery) causes profound bradycardia, hypotension, and a brief period of apnea followed by rapid shallow breathing. This response pattern is called the Bezold\u2013Jarisch reflex.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Elicited by a variety of substances including capsaicin, serotonin, phenyl biguanide, and veratridine. The syndrome of cardiac slowing with hypotension (vasovagal syncope) has also been attributed to the activation of the Bezold\u2013Jarisch reflex. Vasovagal syncope can occur after prolonged upright posture that results in the pooling of blood in the lower extremities and diminished intracardiac blood volume (also called postural syncope). This phenomenon is exaggerated if combined with dehydration. INTEGRATION EDGE Vasovagal syncope has been attributed to the activation of the Bezold Jarisch reflex. The most critical intervention for individuals who experience episodes of neurogenic syncope is to avoid dehydration and avoid situations that trigger the adverse event. Episodes of syncope may be reduced or prevented by an increased dietary salt intake or administration of mineralocorticoids. Vasovagal syncope has been treated with the use of \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists and disopyramide, an antiarrhythmic agent that blocks Na+ channels.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. Cushing reflex, Cushing's triad is characterized by a widened pulse pressure, bradycardia, and irregular respirations (also known as Cheyne\u2013Stokes respirations). Option B. Peripheral chemoreceptors (carotid and aortic bodies) detect changes in arterial blood oxygen and initiate reflexes that are important for maintaining homeostasis during hypoxemia. Option C. The Bainbridge reflex or Bainbridge effect, also called the atrial reflex, is an increase in heart rate due to an increase in central venous pressure. Increased blood volume is detected by stretch receptors (Cardiac Receptors) located on both sides of the atria at the venoatrial junctions.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Bradycardia A premature ventricular beat originates from ventricular pacemaker cells. Most often, these pacemaker cells are reset with each heartbeat and therefore do not produce ventricular activation. However, when the sinus rhythm is very slow (bradycardia), there is time for these pacemaker cells to reach a threshold and produce a ventricular contraction . Because the patient is a well-trained athlete, his bradycardia is an index of his good aerobic conditioning and not a cause for alarm.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>If the ECG revealed a depressed ST segment, which is a sign of ventricular ischemia, the PVCs could have serious consequences. Although an inverted atrial wave can occur following a PVC (if the action potentials propagate into the atria) and a wide QRS complex, these are results, not causes of the premature contractions</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Rest all other options are abnormal findings and have to be worked up and treated.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Vagal Stimulation Causes Bradycardia Any circulatory reflex that stimulates the vagus nerves causes the release of acetylcholine at the vagal endings in the heart, resulting in a parasympathetic effect. Perhaps the most striking example of this phenomenon occurs in patients with carotid sinus syndrome. In these patients, the pressure receptors (baroreceptors) in the carotid sinus region of the carotid artery walls are excessively sensitive. Therefore, even mild external pressure on the neck elicits a strong baroreceptor reflex, causing intense vagal-acetylcholine effects on the heart, including extreme bradycardia.</p>\n<p></p>",
