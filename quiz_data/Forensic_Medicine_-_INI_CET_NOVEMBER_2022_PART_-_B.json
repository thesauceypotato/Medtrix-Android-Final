In marbling, the superficial veins are stained purplish red or greenish brown in a branching pattern . It is usually seen 36-48 hours after death and occurs due to the formation of sulfhemoglobin .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Decomposition/putrefaction: Colour changes: The earliest sign of decomposition is greenish discoloration of the body, seen first in the right iliac fossa externally and under the liver internally ( because in caecum , the contents are more liquid and are full of bacteria.) . In these areas, It appears in 12-18 hours, and slowly spread on whole body in 24-48 hr. greenish discoloration is due to formation of Sulph meth haemoglobin. Hb\u2192 meth Hb\u2192 +H2S\u2192 Sulph meth haemoglobin. Later colour may change to purple, brown, bluish green or even almost black ( colour black is due to ferric sulphide.) The colouring matter (Hb) dissociates from the B.C. and the colour is taken up by the blood vessels, which are seen as prominent lines having purple, green or brown colour, especially on shoulders, axilla & Inguinal area. This change results in 24-48 hr , and is labelled as marbling.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A.Tattooing-Partly burnt/unburnt gun powder particles.Around entry wound, they are adherent to the skin. It cannot be wiped away and felt as This is called tattooing / stippling / peppering. Option B.Lividity- It is purplish blue or purplish red discoloration seen under the skin in the most superficial layers of dermis, on dependent parts of the body after death due to capillo-venous distension. Option D.Cataleptic rigidity- A group of voluntary muscles which are active & contracted at the moment of death. They continue to be in the same state of contraction, after death for a few hours.</p>\n<p></p>",

Normal acid phosphatase test activity in human semen is 340 \u2013 360 Bodansky units per ml of semen.
