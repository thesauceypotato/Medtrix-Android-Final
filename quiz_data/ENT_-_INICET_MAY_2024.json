Laterally, it extends into pterygomaxillary fossa and thence to infratemporal fossa and cheek Symptoms: Profuse, recurrent and spontaneous epistaxis Progressive nasal obstruction and denasal speech.

Consistency is firm but digital palpation should never be done until at the time of operation.

There is a significant increase in the incidence of Type 2 nerve in large volume glands, thereby making it more prone to injury during dissection. Hence, dissection of a large volume gland should be more meticulous than a low-volume gland. The EBSLN should be identified and preserved before ligating the superior pole vessels</p>\n<p></p>",
