A weak acid must be present in a partially dissociated form to act as a buffer.

Thus, at pH 7.4, most of the NH 3 will be present as an ammonium ion. The absorption of hydrogen ions will tend to increase, not decrease, which will cause an increase in the pH of the blood (thus, A is incorrect). With the decrease of hydrogen ions, carbonic acid will dissociate to produce more bicarbonate as H 2 CO 3 \u2192 HCO 3 \u2212 + H + , and more CO 2 will go toward carbonic acid (inspiration rather than expiration is increased) (thus, C and D are incorrect).</p>\n<p></p>",

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, one can calculate that the concentration of the conjugate base is 0.061 M and that of the acid is 0.039 M. pH = pKa + log [Base/Acid], so 7.4 = 7.2 + log [Base/Acid] or log [Base/Acid] = 0.2 Taking antilog on both sides Base/acid = 1.58 A total concentration of acid + base is 0.1 molar in the initial solution (given) So, the concentration Of base = is 061M, and the concentration of acid is 0.039 M giving a ratio of 1.58. The reaction occurs at this point, generating 0.01 M protons (10 \u03bcmol/mL is a concentration of 10 mM or 0.01 M). As the protons are generated, they combine with the conjugate base, producing the acid. This will change the concentration of conjugate base to 0.051 (0.061-0.01) M and the concentration of the acid rise to 0.049 (0.039+ 0.01) M. Plugging those values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation leads to a pH value of 7.22.</p>\n<p></p>",
