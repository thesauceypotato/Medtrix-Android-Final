      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>100% Oxygen at atmospheric pressure through tight fitting mask along with steroids and antibiotics. This is a case of CO (Carbon Monoxide) poisoning indicated by the symptoms and signs by the patient along with the relevant history of sleeping in a closed room with a heating appliance. CO poisoning causes Anemic hypoxia because of the formation of Carboxy haemoglobin \u2013 so it should be treated with 100% Oxygen. CO is a colourless, tasteless, non-irritative gas which is produced due to the incomplete combustion of carbon. It is insoluble in water, a yellow flame generates CO while a blue flame burns completely with no byproducts. CO is readily absorbed across the alveoli and combined with haemoglobin. It displaces oxygen from its combination with haemoglobin and forms a relatively stable compound known as Carboxyhemoglobin. It thus reduces the oxygen content of the blood, and hence that of the tissues. It inhibits electron transport by blocking cytochrome A3 oxidase and cytochrome P450 and so blocking intercellular respiration. Symptoms depend on CO concentration in blood- < 10% - No symptoms. 10-20% - Breathless on moderate exertion, headache, weakness. 20-30% - Severe headache, irritability, emotional instability, defective memory. 30-40% - Cherry red discolouration of the skin, mucous membrane, decreased vision, nausea and vomiting. 40-5% - Resemble acute alcoholic intoxication. 50-60% - Syncope and coma. >80% - Death. Treatment - Remove the patient to fresh air immediately, if conscious and breathing, no treatment is required. Otherwise, all patients having > 25% CO should be treated. Use of 100% oxygen at atmospheric pressure and in case of hyperbaric O2- 100% oxygen at pressure. Antibiotics are given as prophylaxis against lung infection, along with steroids.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option : A. Giving 0.2ml Amyl nitrite inhalation along with 0.3g Sodium nitrite and 25g Sodium thiosulphate infusion is the treatment option for Cyanide poisoning. The principle of the treatment is to reverse the Cyanide-cytochrome combination and excrete the cyanide through urine after converting it to Non- toxic thiocyanate. Option: C. Symptomatic treatment along with Sodium thiosulphate is given in case of MIC (Methyl Isocyanate) poisoning, it is one of the deadliest chemicals and kills in very small doses when ingested, inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Option: D. In case of CO2 poisoning, artificial respiration and oxygen should be given along with cardiac stimulants. It is a heavy, colourless gas with a faintly sweet odour.</p>\n<p></p>",

Any chemical (gaseous, liquid or solid) which is used to produce destruction or damage mostly in times of war is termed a \u201cWar Gas\u201d. These are used to injure or kill enemies during war. They produce physiological changes in the human body, some substances are lethal and some injure or incapacitate people. Various types of War gases used are as- Vesicant / Blistering gas - These are mainly sulphur, mustard, phosgene, They are discharged in artillery shells so as to saturate the area of attack. Mustard gas causes irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and respiratory passage. Wash the affected parts thoroughly, eye wash with Sodium bicarbonate. Asphyxiants / Lung irritants - These are chlorine and phosgene which are gases and can be released from tanks and gas shells. When inhaled, they cause watering of the eyes, coughing, dyspnoea, and tightness of the Eyewash with boric acid, oxygen and adrenaline, antitussives, and antibiotics are given. Lachrymators / Tear gases - These are mainly chloroacetophenone (CAP); ethyl iodoacetate (KSK); Bromobenzyl cyanide (BBC), fired in artillery shells or pen guns. The vapours cause intense irritation of the eyes with a copious flow of tears, spasms of eyelids and temporary blindness. Remove the patient to fresh air and wash the eyes with warm normal saline or boric acid. Sternutators / Nasal Irritants - These are solid, organic compounds of arsenic and are fired in artillery shells. They are Diphenylcyanarsine and Diphenyl chlorarsine. The vapours cause intense pain and irritation in the nose and sinuses, nausea, and Paralysants - Hydrocyanic acid, CO, and Sulphuretted hydrogen are examples. Nerve Gases - These are esters of phosphoric acid and are identical to organophosphates. The major agents are- Tabun; Sarin; Soman. They are colourless and odourless volatile agents, absorbed from lungs, GIT, skin, etc. It is the correct match, war gases like Lung irritants, lachrymators, and nerve gases are given with their correct examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>CO The given autopsy findings are of CO poisoning. CO poisoning causes anaemic hypoxia by causing the formation of Carboxy Hemoglobin and a leftward shift of the Oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. CO is a colourless, tasteless, non- irritative and odourless gas and is lighter than air. It is produced by incomplete combustion of Carbonaceous material, and on combining with chlorine it forms Carbonyl chloride (phosgene). It is produced by tobacco smoke, house fires, automobile exhaust (1-7% CO), faulty heating units (stoves, water heaters), coal gas, and endogenous CO. CO causes inhibition of electron transport by blocking cytochrome oxidase A3 and cytochrome P450 and hence intracellular respiration. CO is a colourless, tasteless, non-irritative and odourless gas and lighter than air.

Differential diagnosis- Alcohol intoxication; Head injury; Diabetic/ Insulin coma; Uremia; Cerebral haemorrhage; Narcotic poisoning. Autopsy findings evident of CO poisoning are- Cherry red colour discolouration of the skin, mucous membrane, blood, blisters are subcutaneous and over-dependent parts of body, buttocks, calves, knee along with B/L symmetrical necrosis of globus pallidus and putamen.
