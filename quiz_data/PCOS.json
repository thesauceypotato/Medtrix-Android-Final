Option C - Testosterone-secreting tumor\u2013 It is a rare condition, which is almost always accompanied by severe or rapidly progressive hirsutism and symptoms or signs of virilization (deepening of voice, temporal or male pattern baldness,, breast atrophy, increased muscle mass and clitoromegaly). Also, ovaries are normal on ultrasound in this patient whereas in the case of testosterone-producing tumors, solid ovarian mass lesions should be identified in most cases. Option D- Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is caused by adrenal steroidogenic enzyme defects that result in excessive adrenal androgen production. MC cause is 21 hydroxylase enzyme deficiency other rare causes are Defects in 11B hydroxylase, 3b hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is characterized by ovarian enlargement, pleural and peritoneal effusion, oliguria, liver damage, and thromboembolism. Caused by ovulation induction by: Clomiphene citrate FSH/LH (MC) GnRH Risk factors: lean and thin patients, Previous h/o OHSS Young age < 30 years, PCOS , Serum E2 >2500 pg/ml, rapidly rising serum E2 levels (>75% rise from previous day), ovarian\u2018necklace sign\u2019 on USG (multiple small follicles), hCG administration and multiple pregnancies. Prevention \u2014Complete prevention may not be possible but severity can be reduced. The important steps to be taken are : Use of GnRH antagonists for pituitary down-regulation. Low starting dose of gonadotropins in high-risk women. Metformin cotreatment during gonadotropin stimulation in women with PCOS. Close monitoring of the superovulation cycles using TVS and serum estradiol estimation. To withhold ovulatory dose of hCG in susceptible cases and to cancel the cycle or to delay the dose of hCG injection (coasting). Ultrasonographic view of ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome.

Oral fluid is continued to prevent hemoconcentration and to maintain renal perfusion. Normal saline 150 ml/ hr IV is given when hematocrit is >45 percent. To relieve respiratory distress, abdominal paracentesis may be done under USG guidance. Human albumin (50 ml of 25%) may be administered to correct hypovolemia. It may be repeated.
