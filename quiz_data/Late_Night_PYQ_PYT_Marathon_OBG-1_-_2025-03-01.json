A) Stop warfarin and start LMWH.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Stop warfarin and start LMWH: Warfarin is teratogenic and has a significant risk of causing warfarin embryopathy, particularly in doses greater than 5mg per day. In pregnancy, it is recommended to change warfarin to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the first trimester, especially if the warfarin dose exceeds 5 mg/day. After 13 weeks, it can be switched back to warfarin until delivery.

Stop warfarin and start heparin: This option is partially correct as it aligns with the practice of switching from warfarin to a safer anticoagulant near delivery.

Stop warfarin and start heparin:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Continue warfarin: This is incorrect because continuing warfarin at 36 weeks of gestation poses significant risks of fetal hemorrhage and warfarin embryopathy. It is essential to switch to a safer anticoagulant like LMWH or UFH close to delivery.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Continue warfarin:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Stop warfarin, start LMWH and aspirin: While this option includes stopping warfarin and starting LMWH, which is correct, the addition of aspirin is only indicated in women who are at a very high risk of thrombosis.

D) Increase GnRH release</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) function through several mechanisms to prevent pregnancy, but increasing the release of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) is not one of them. In fact, OCPs inhibit the release of GnRH.</li><li>\u2022 Mechanisms of action of OCPs:</li><li>\u2022 Mechanisms of action of OCPs:</li><li>\u2022 Inhibit ovulation: By suppressing the release of GnRH, and consequently, the pituitary secretion of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH), OCPs prevent the development and release of an ovum. Prevent implantation: OCPs create a less favorable endometrial environment for implantation of a fertilized egg. Cervical mucus thickening: OCPs increase the viscosity of cervical mucus, making it more difficult for sperm to enter the uterus and fertilize an ovum. Produce static endometrial hypoplasia: OCPs cause the endometrial lining to remain thin, which further prevents implantation. Affect tubal motility: OCPs can alter the motility of the fallopian tubes, reducing the likelihood of sperm meeting an ovum.</li><li>\u2022 Inhibit ovulation: By suppressing the release of GnRH, and consequently, the pituitary secretion of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH), OCPs prevent the development and release of an ovum.</li><li>\u2022 Inhibit ovulation:</li><li>\u2022 Prevent implantation: OCPs create a less favorable endometrial environment for implantation of a fertilized egg.</li><li>\u2022 Prevent implantation:</li><li>\u2022 Cervical mucus thickening: OCPs increase the viscosity of cervical mucus, making it more difficult for sperm to enter the uterus and fertilize an ovum.</li><li>\u2022 Cervical mucus thickening:</li><li>\u2022 Produce static endometrial hypoplasia: OCPs cause the endometrial lining to remain thin, which further prevents implantation.</li><li>\u2022 Produce static endometrial hypoplasia:</li><li>\u2022 Affect tubal motility: OCPs can alter the motility of the fallopian tubes, reducing the likelihood of sperm meeting an ovum.</li><li>\u2022 Affect tubal motility:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
