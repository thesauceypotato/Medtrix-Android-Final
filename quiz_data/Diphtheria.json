Diphtheriae Toxicity Modified Elek immunoprecipitation method A filter paper disk containing antitoxin (10 IU/disk) is placed on an agar plate. The cultures to be tested (at least ten colonies should be chosen) for toxigenicity are spot inoculated 7\u20139 mm away from the disk. After 48 hours of incubation, the antitoxin diffusing from the paper disk precipitated the toxin diffusing from toxigenic cultures. It has resulted in precipitin bands between the disk and the bacterial growth.</p>\n<p></p>",
