This means that the female worms can produce fertile eggs without mating with a male. In the human host, only female Strongyloides worms are found in the intestine, and they are capable of producing eggs or larvae without male fertilization. Oviparous, Viviparous, and Oviviparous Nematodes: Oviparous: These worms lay eggs which then develop outside the female\u2019s body. Examples include Ascaris and Trichuris. Viviparous: These worms give birth to live larvae. Examples include some species of Dracunculus and Wuchereria. Oviviparous: These worms lay eggs that hatch immediately as they are laid, producing larvae. Strongyloides stercoralis is an example, as the eggs hatch into larvae almost immediately after being laid.</li><li>\u2022 Strongyloides stercoralis: Strongyloides stercoralis is unique among the nematodes because it can reproduce through parthenogenesis.
