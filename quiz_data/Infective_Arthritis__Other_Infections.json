If only one vertebra is affected, the disc is normal, but if two are involved, the avascular disc, cannot receive nutrients and collapses. The disc tissue dies and is broken down by caseation, leading to vertebral narrowing and eventually to vertebral collapse (Bony ankylosis) and spinal damage.

Although, its incidence is on the decline in developed countries, it continues to be an important problem in developing countries. The other causes of chronic osteomyelitis are tuberculosis, fungal infections etc. There are three types of chronic osteomyelitis: Chronic osteomyelitis secondary to acute osteomyelitis. Garre's osteomyelitis. Brodie's abscess. PATHOLOGY Acute osteomyelitis commonly leads to chronic osteomyelitis because of one or more of the following reasons: Delayed and inadequate treatment: This is the commonest cause for the persistence of an osteomyelitis. Delay causes spread of pus within the medullary cavity and sub- periosteally. This results in the death of a part of the bone (sequestrum formation). Destruction of cancellous bone leads to the formation of cavities within the bone. Such 'non-collapsing\" bone cavities and sequestra are responsible for persistent infection. Type and virulence of organism: Sometimes, despite early, adequate treatment of acute osteomyelitis, the body's defense mechanism may not be able to control the damaging influence of a highly virulent organism, and the infection persists. Reduced host resistance: Malnutrition compromises the body's defense mechanisms, thus letting the infection persist. COMPLICATIONS OF CHRONIC OSTEOMYELITIS: Arthritis Skeletal deformations Malignant transformation (eg, Marjolin ulcer [squamous cell carcinoma], SCC of the sinus tract) S econdary amyloidosis P athologic fractures</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
