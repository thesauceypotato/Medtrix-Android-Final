      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Phosphorus Poisoning The features mentioned in the case indicates it to be a case of Chronic phosphorus poisoning. There are 2 varieties of Phosphorus - White/ Yellow and Red Phosphorus. White phosphorus is used in fertilizers, rodenticides, fireworks, gunpowder, etc. While Red phosphorus is used on the sides of a matchbox. In the case of chronic poisoning, there is a frequent inhalation of fumes over a period of years causing necrosis of the lower jaw in the region of a decayed tooth. The vapors act on the jaw through a carious tooth or an interspace due to a missing tooth where suppurative microorganisms are already present. At first there is a toothache, which is followed by swelling of the jaw, loosening of the teeth, necrosis of gums, and sequestration of bone in the mandible. It is known as \u201cPhossy Jaw\u201d (glassy jaw) in which osteomyelitis and necrosis of the jaw occur, with multiple sinuses discharging foul-smelling Its systemic symptoms include - Nausea, Vomiting, Anorexia, Pain in the stomach, Indigestion, purging, pain in the joints, loss of weight, bronchitis, jaundice, and anemia. The fatal dose for Phosphorus poisoning is 60-120mg. The treatment includes Gastric lavage using a 1:5000 solution of Potassium permanganate which causes the oxidation of phosphorus into phosphoric acid and phosphates, which are harmless. Stomach wash with activated charcoal, 0.2% CuSO4 solution until vomiting occurs is done. Vit. K (20mg), i.v. in repeated doses to combat hypoprothrombinemia, or blood transfusion is given. Phosphorus Poisoning - Phossy Jaw, i.e, chronic osteomyelitis of mandible with multiple sinuses discharging foul-smelling fluid/ pus. The disease is obsolete now as safety matches are used which are made of Potassium chlorate, Antimony sulfide.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Arsenic Poisoning - Chronic Arsenic poisoning causes, hyperkeratosis of palms and soles, brown mottled patches over eyelids, forehead, and temple, and rashes resembling measles are seen. Sub-endocardial hemorrhages of ventricles were seen only in 4 poisons- Arsenic, Phosphorus, Mercury, and Viper Snake Bite. Option: C. Mercury Poisoning - It inhibits the sulphydryl group of mitochondrial enzymes. Chronic mercury poisoning is called Hydrargyrism, characterized by a classical triad of- Gingivostomatitis, Mercurial tremors, and mercurial erethism. The characteristic finding of Mercuria lentis (deposition of mercury in anterior lens capsule gives malt brown reflex on slit lamp examination) is seen. Option: D. Lead Poisoning - Metallic lead is poisonous, Chronic lead poisoning is called Plumbism/ Saturnism. The characteristic features of Lead poisoning include Circumoral facial pallor, microcytic hypochromic anemia, eosinophilia, Burtonian lines (seen at the junction of teeth and gums, in those teeth that are infected/ caries because of decomposition of food, H2S is formed), lead palsy and lead encephalopathy.</p>\n<p></p>",

The garlicky smell of breath and vomitus along with the clinical features and the history of ingestion of rat paste indicates a case of Phosphorus poisoning. The 2 varieties of phosphorus are \u2013 White (crystalline, used in fertilizers, insecticides, rodenticides, etc.) and Red (amorphous and non- toxic). White phosphorus is a protoplasmic poison, which affects cellular oxidation. Fatal dose- 60 to 120mg; fatal period- 2 to 8 days. There are 3 types of poisoning in this case: 1. Fulminating poison- when more than 1g poison is ingested, patients usually die within 12 hrs due to shock and cardiovascular collapse because phosphorus has a direct action on the heart and blood vessels. Those who survive more than 12 hrs are restless, delirious and some maniacal before death. Symptoms like thirst, severe nausea, vomiting, and retching occur. Acute poison- It occurs in 3 stages. Due to local irritation, symptoms occur within a few minutes to a few hrs after exposure and last from 8 hrs to 3 days. Ingestion produces burning pain in the throat and abdomen, with intense thirst, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and severe abdominal pain. The 2nd stage is the symptom-free period lasting for 2-3 days. Red phosphorus is Reddish brown in color, an amorphous solid mass. It is odorless, tasteless, and non-luminous in the dark. On exposure to air, it is non-oxidized, non-fuming, and non-inflammable. It is found on the sides of matchboxes. Treatment includes Gastric lavage (1:5000 KMnO4 which oxides phosphorus into phosphoric acid and phosphates, which are harmless; Stomach washes with activated charcoal and 0.2% Copper Sulphate solution); Vitamin K 20mg, i.v., in repeated doses to combat hypoprothrombinaemia or blood transfusion; Bowel should be evacuated with Magnesium sulfate. S.NO. Trait White phosphorus Red phosphorus (1) Colour: White or yellow. Reddish-brown (2) Appearance: Translucent, waxy cylinders. Amorphous, solid mass. (3) Smell: Garlicky. Odourless. (4) Taste: Garlicky. Tasteless. (5) Luminosity: Luminous in the dark. Non-luminous. (6) Exposure to air: Oxidises and emits white fumes; ignites at 34\u00b0C. and as such kept underwater. Non-oxidized, non-fuming. non-inflammable. (7) Use Fertilisers, and vermin-killers, rodenticide, fireworks, gunpowder, etc. On the sides of a matchbox. (8) Toxicity: Highly toxic. Non-toxic.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option A. White phosphorus causes vomitus and excreta to be luminescent known as Smoky stool syndrome, it is a diagnostic feature along with the Garlicky smell of the breath, vomitus, and excreta. Option B. White phosphorus is white or yellow in color and is translucent and as waxy cylinders, it causes fatty degeneration of the liver with some cellular necrosis, and small hemorrhages on the surface and in the substance. Option C . Iodine occurs as bluish-black, soft, and scaly crystals and has a metallic luster and an unpleasant taste, it gives off a violet-colored vapor at all temperatures, which has a characteristic odor.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Phosphorus It is given Phosphorus which oxides on exposure to air, so stored under water. The findings of the autopsy also revealed it to the be a case of Phosphorus Poisoning. Phosphorus exists in two varieties- White or crystalline: Samples of white phosphorus always contain some red phosphorus and therefore appear yellow also called \u2018yellow phosphorus\u2019. Red or amorphous: White gradually changes to red phosphorus. This transformation is accelerated by heat and light. It is a protoplasmic poison and affects cellular oxidation. The metabolism of cells reduces, leading to necrobiosis which is predominantly seen in the White phosphorus causes painful penetrating second to third-degree burn injuries. It typically appears as a necrotic area with a yellowish color and a characteristic garlicky odor. It is lipid soluble and hence results in rapid dermal penetration and delayed wound healing. PM findings:- External Emaciation, purpuric hemorrhages in the skin, jaundice, and smell of garlic may be present.\" The mucous membrane of the mouth is corroded. Hypostasis is dark brown in color.3 Internal Multiple hemorrhages are seen in the muscles, serosal and mucosal membranes of the GIT and respiratory tract, liver, kidneys, endocardium, pericardium, epicardium, peritoneum, lungs, and brain. Stomach and intestines: Mucous membranes are yellowish or grayish-white in color, softened, thickened, inflamed, and corroded in patches; luminous material may be found in the stomach. Contents may smell of garlic. Liver: Swollen, yellow, soft, fatty, and easily ruptured.* Kidneys: Enlarged, greasy, yellow. Heart: Flabby, pale, and shows fatty degeneration. Lungs: Fat emboli may be found in the pulmonary arterioles and capillaries. Treatment includes - Gastric lavage using a 1:5000 solution of Potassium permanganate which oxidizes phosphorus into phosphoric acid and phosphates, which are harmless is the correct option to treat for the poisoning of phosphorus. The stomach can be washed with 0.2% copper sulfate solution or 0.2g of Copper sulfate may be given every 5 minutes until vomiting occurs. It coats the particles of phosphorus with a film of copper phosphide which is relatively harmless. As it has caustic properties and can cause acute copper poisoning care should be taken. Vit K (20mg) i.v. in repeated doses to combat hypoprothrombinaemia or blood transfusion is the correct option for vitamin replacement. It is a case of phosphorus poisoning as the image and the autopsy findings suggest of it. It has hemorrhagic syndrome along with hepatotoxicity and the features of luminescence and garlicky odor of excreta, vomitus, and intestinal contents.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Cadmium is a soft, white metal, used in welding, metal plating, battery, and plastic industries. Poisoning may occur from the inhalation of cadmium dust or fumes or from the ingestion of cadmium PM findings show pulmonary edema and emphysema. There may be degeneration and/or loss of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells. Option: C. Copper causes greenish-blue discoloration of vomitus and skin due to the fumes of copper. PM changes include froth and gastric contents turning greenish-blue. Green lines on gums. Chalcosis is the condition of presence of copper deposits in tissues. Option: D . Metallic lead is poisonous, Chronic lead poisoning is called Plumbism/Saturnism. The characteristic features of Lead poisoning includes Circumoral facial pallor, microcytic hypochromic anemia, eosinophilia, and Burtonian lines seen at the junction of teeth and gums.</p>\n<p></p>",
