On the other hand, nasopharyngeal swabs are easy to obtain and are most commonly used. The fluorescent-antibody assay of nasopharyngeal samples is a rapid and reliable method to diagnose pertussis.

Immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies are transferred; and not Immunoglobulin (IgM). Transfer of these antibodies occurs through the placenta mainly via the neonatal Fc receptor, and the transfer depends on several factors including placenta integrity, gestational maturity, a subclass of IgG, and maternal antibody concentration. In humans, maternal antibody transfer starts as early as week 13 of gestation. The level of IgG in fetal circulation is dependent on gestation, being 50 % of the maternal level by week 32 and usually exceeding the maternal level at delivery. Not all antibodies against different pathogens can be transferred; an example is antibodies against pertussis do not cross the placenta leaving the neonate exposed to pertussis infection around birth and necessitating vaccination (active protection).</p>\n<p></p>",
