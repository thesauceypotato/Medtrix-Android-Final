It is associated with Rheumatoid arthritis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>EPISCLERITIS Episcleritis is benign, recurrent, inflammation of the episclera, involving the overlying Tenon's capsule but not the underlying sclera. It typically affects young adults, being twice as common in women than men. Episcleritis is characterised by redness, mild ocular discomfort described as gritty, burning or foreign body sensation. Simple episcleritis accounts for 75% of cases and is characterised by sectorial (occasionally diffuse) inflammation of episclera. The engorged episcleral vessels are large and run in radial direction beneath the conjunctiva. Nodular episcleritis is characterised by a pink or purple Flat nodule surrounded by injection, usually situated 2-3 mm away from the limbus . The nodule is firm, tender, can be moved separately from the sclera and the overlying conjunctiva also moves freely. Episcleritis: A, Diffuse; B, Nodular</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Pinguecula is a bilateral, usually stationary condition, preseming as yellowish white triangular patch near the limbus. Apex of the triangle is away from the cornea. It affects the nasal side first and then the temporal side. Pinguecula Option: C. Pterygium (L. Pterygion = a wing) is a vving-shaped fold of conjunctiva encroaching upon the cornea from either side within the interpalpebraJ fissure. Pterygium Option: D. Scleritis refers to an inflammation of the sclera proper. It is a comparatively serious disease which may cause visual impairment and even loss of the eye if treated inadequately. Patients complain of moderate to severe pain which is deep and boring in character and often wakes the patient early in the morning. Photophobia and Lacrimation may be mild to moderate.</p>\n<p></p>",

Intravenous mannitol. Systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, e.g. acetazolamide Topical antiglaucoma drugs to be instilled immediately include: Beta-blocker, Alpha adrenergic agonists, e.g. brimonidine, Prostaglandin analogue, e.g. latanoprost Pilocarpine 2% QID should be started after 1 hour of the commencement of the treatment, i.e. when IOP is lowered, as at higher IOP sphincter is ischaemic and unresponsive to pilocarpine. Definitive therapy Laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI)- Laser peripheral iridotomy (with Nd:YAG laser or Argon Laser) should always be preferred over surgical PI. Prophylactic treatment in the normal  fellow eye - Prophylactic laser iridotomy (preferably) or surgical peripheral iridectomy should be performed on the fellow asymptomatic eye (PACS) as early as possible as chances of acute attack are 50% in such eyes.</p>\n<p></p>",
