The underlying pathologic process is leukocytoclastic venality , although vessels of any size and in any organ can be involved. Essential criteria: Recurrent painful aphthous ulcers involving the oral cavity . The recurrent oral aphthous ulcerations are a sine qua non for the diagnosis . The ulcers persist for 1\u20132 weeks and subside without leaving scars. Genital ulcers are less common but more specific, are painful, do not affect the glans penis or urethra, and produce scrotal and vulvar scars . There is an association with certain HLA haplotypes ( HLA-B51 , in particular), and a cross-reactive immune response to certain microorganisms is implicated. TH17 cells play a significant role by contributing to the recruitment of neutrophils , which are seen infiltrating vessel walls . Drug of choice: Colchicine .

The thrombus can contain small microabscesses composed of neutrophils surrounded by granulomatous inflammation , the thrombus may eventually organize and recanalize. Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease). The lumen is occluded by a thrombus containing abscesses (arrow), and the vessel wall is infiltrated with leukocytes. The inflammatory process extends into contiguous veins and nerves (rare with other forms of vasculitis), and with time all three structures can be encased in fibrous tissue. Early manifestations include the Raynaud phenomenon , instep foot pain induced by exercise (instep claudication) , and superficial nodular phlebitis (venous inflammation) . The vascular insufficiency of Buerger disease tends to be accompanied by severe pain \u2014even at rest\u2014undoubtedly due to neural involvement .

There is NO association with ANCA , but about 30% of patients with PAN have chronic hepatitis B and deposits containing HBsAg-HBsAb complexes in affected vessels. The cause remains unknown in the majority of cases. Clinical manifestations result from ischemia and infarction of affected tissues and organs. PAN is associated with segmental transmural necrotizing inflammation of small- to medium-sized arteries , often with superimposed aneurysms and/or thrombosis . Kidney, heart, liver, and gastrointestinal tract vessels are involved in descending order of frequency. Lesions usually involve only part of the vessel circumference with a predilection for branch points . During the acute phase, there is transmural inflammation of the arterial wall with a mixed infiltrate of neutrophils, eosinophils, and mononuclear cells , frequently accompanied by fibrinoid necrosis and luminal thrombosis. Older lesions show fibrous thickening of the vessel wall extending into the adventitia . Characteristically, all stages of activity (from early to late) coexist in different vessels or even within the same vessel , suggesting ongoing injury. Polyarteritis nodosa. There is segmental fibrinoid necrosis and thrombotic occlusion of the lumen of this small artery. Note that part of the vessel wall at the upper right (arrow) is uninvolved.
