Leucovorin (formyl tetrahydrofolate, also called folinic acid) is accumulated more readily by normal cells than by neoplastic cells.

Renal function: Variable Neurologic toxicities: subacute meningeal irritation, stiff neck, headache, and fever. Rarely, seizures, encephalopathy or paraplegia occur. Contraindications: Because MTX is teratogenic in experimental animals and is an abortifacient, it should be avoided in pregnancy.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Drug/Toxin Antidote/Treatments Lithium\n  Carbonate (Eskalith) Sodium\n  Bicarbonate Magnesium\n  Sulfate Calcium\n  Gluconate Methanol,\n  ethylene glycol (antifreeze) Ethanol,\n  dialysis, fomepizole Methemoglobin Methelyn\n  blue Methotrexate\n  (Adverse effects cause folic acid deficiency) Leucovorin\n  calcium</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Macrocytic anemia Reason-Macrocytic anemia. Methotrexate is a folate antimetabolite. It inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which is necessary for recycling folate from its oxidized form to its usable, reduced form, tetrahydrofolate. Without tetrahydrofolate, cells cannot replicate DNA. This not only makes methotrexate useful against the rapidly dividing cells of cancer but may also significantly impair DNA synthesis in normal cells with prolonged use. In particular, extended use of methotrexate can disrupt the mitosis of hematopoietic cells and lead to megaloblastic anemia, a form of macrocytic anemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Causes of Macrocytic anemia (ABCDEF) A- Alcohol + liver disease B- B 12 deficiency C- Compensatory reticulocytes D- Drugs(cytotoxic and AZT), Dysplasia of bone marrow E- Endocrine (Hypothyroidism) F- Folate deficiency</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A & B - Thalassemia is a genetic anemia caused by the loss of function of one or more globin genes. Methotrexate does not cause a-thalassemia. Option: D - Microcytic anemia occurs when hematopoietic cell growth is slowed but the rate of DNA synthesis is unchanged.
