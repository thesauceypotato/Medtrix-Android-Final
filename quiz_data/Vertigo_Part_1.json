      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dix Hallpike maneuver This is a patient who has dizziness which can describe a variety of common sensations that include vertigo, lightheadedness, faintness and imbalance. The patient has symptoms of Episodic dizziness on changing position point towards a diagnosis of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo ( when head position changes, gravity causes the otoconia to move within the canal, producing vertigo and nystagmus ) which can be diagnosed on Dix Hallpike maneuver.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Dix Hallpike maneuver- All patients with episodic dizziness, especially if provoked by positional change, should be tested with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Step 1- The patient begins in a sitting position with the head turned 45 degrees. Step 2- Holding the back of the head, the examiner then lowers the patient into a supine position with the head extended backwards by about 20 degrees while watching the eyes. Step 3-Posterior canal BPPV can be diagnosed confidently if transient up beating-torsional nystagmus is seen. Step 4- If no nystagmus is observed after 15\u201320 s , the patient is raised to the sitting position. Step 5- The procedure is repeated with the head turned to the other side. Frenzel goggles may improve the sensitivity of the test.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Check for eye movements Particular focus is given to checking eye movements . However, when there is the presence of episodic dizziness on changing his position, the Dix Hallpike maneuver should be performed. Option B. Head impulse test This test can identify both unilateral and bilateral vestibular hypofunction. However, when there is the presence of episodic dizziness on changing his position, the Dix Hallpike maneuver should be performed. Dynamic visual acuity testing This test is a functional test that is used for assessing vestibular function . However, when there is the presence of episodic dizziness on changing his position, the Dix Hallpike maneuver should be performed.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Modified Epley maneuver - for treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the right (top panels) left (bottom panels) posterior semicircular canals . Step 1. With the patient seated , turn the head 45 degrees toward the affected ear. Step 2 . Keeping the head turned, lower the patient to the head-hanging position and hold for at least 30 s and until the nystagmus disappears. Step 3. Without lifting the head, turn it 90 degrees toward the other side . Hold for another 30 s. Step 4. Rotate the patient onto her side while turning the head another 90 degrees , so that the nose is pointed down 45 degrees . Hold again for 30 s. Step 5. Have the patient sit up on the side of the table . After a brief rest , the maneuver should be repeated to confirm successful treatment.</p>\n<p></p>",

Procedure: Check if the tympanic membrane is intact. One ear is tested at a time. A small amount of cold water (30 degrees) or air is gently delivered into one of your ears. The eyes should show an involuntary movement called nystagmus. Then they should turn away from that ear and slowly back. A small amount of warm water(44 degrees) or air is gently delivered into the same ear. Again, Eyes should show nystagmus. Then they should turn toward the same ear and slowly back.

The exact pathophysiological mechanism, however, remains unclear. Clinical features- Vertigo hearing loss Pain, pressure, and/or fullness in the affected ear Low-frequency hearing loss Audiometry at the time of an attack - asymmetric low-frequency hearing loss hearing commonly improves between attacks although permanent hearing loss may eventually occur. Treatment- Diuretics Sodium restrictions If attacks persist- Injections of glucocorticoids or gentamicin into the middle ear Non Ablative surgical decompression and shunting of the endolymphatic sac.

Option C.Vestibular neuronitis-Severe vertigo of sudden onset with no cochlear symptoms. Attacks may last from a few days to 2 or 3 weeks . It is thought to occur due to a virus that attacks the vestibular ganglion (following viral infection-Upper Respiratory tract infection). Option D. Acoustic neuroma - It has been classified as a peripheral vestibular disorder as it arises from CN VIII within the internal acoustic meatus. It causes Sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and loss of corneal reflex ( Most common ). Severe episodic vertigo , as seen in the end-organ disease, is usually missing .</p>\n<p></p>",
