      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. C. 1 only</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 1. CO2 embolism : During laparoscopic procedures, CO2 is used to insufflate the abdomen, creating a pneumoperitoneum. This allows for better visualization and manipulation of the internal structures. If there's a vascular injury, especially to a large vein, CO2 can enter the circulation and cause an embolism. This can lead to sudden cardiovascular collapse and a sharp drop in EtCO2, as observed in the scenario. Also, a sudden drop in oxygen saturation (SpO2) can occur due to the embolism obstructing the pulmonary vasculature. The significant drop in EtCO2, in this case, is indicative of a CO2 embolism.</li><li>\u2022 1. CO2 embolism</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 2. Severe bronchospasm : Bronchospasm would lead to an increase in peak airway pressure, which wasn't seen in this scenario (the peak airway pressure was 18 cm of H2O, which is within the normal range). Moreover, EtCO2 would generally be elevated in bronchospasm due to retention of CO2, not decreased as seen in the scenario.</li><li>\u2022 2. Severe bronchospasm</li><li>\u2022 3. Pneumothorax : A pneumothorax could cause a drop in SpO2 and blood pressure. However, the EtCO2 drop to 8 mm Hg in the setting of laparoscopic surgery more specifically suggests a CO2 embolism. Additionally, one would expect an increase in peak airway pressures with a tension pneumothorax.</li><li>\u2022 3. Pneumothorax</li><li>\u2022 4. Single bronchus intubation : If the endotracheal tube is advanced too far and intubates a single bronchus, it would lead to ventilation of one lung only. This can cause a decrease in SpO2, but the sudden drop in EtCO2 as seen in the scenario isn't typical for single bronchus intubation.</li><li>\u2022 4.

Treatment is based on prognostication and staging. According to the given scoring system, the parameters such as the time interval since the antecedent pregnancy, beta-hCG levels, and the presence of lung metastases suggest a low-risk choriocarcinoma. For low-risk choriocarcinoma, the recommended treatment is multi-dose single-agent chemotherapy with methotrexate. Methotrexate is administered in a multi-dose regimen (Day 1, 3, 5, 7) alternating with folinic acid (Day 2, 4, 6, 8).</li><li>\u2022 Methotrexate with folinic acid:</li><li>\u2022 < 6: LOW RISK > 7 HIGH RISK</li><li>\u2022 < 6: LOW RISK</li><li>\u2022 > 7 HIGH RISK</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

EMACO regimen: The EMACO regimen, which includes etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine, is used for high-risk choriocarcinoma.
