Carbonic anhydrase II is an enzyme that converts carbon dioxide and water into H+ and bicarbonate. The protons created are then transported across the ruffled border of osteoclasts, leading to acidification and demineralisation of the bone matrix. There are AD and AR forms of osteopetrosis, with the AR form usually being fatal in the first few years of life.

The optic and auditory nerves are most affected (optic > auditory > trigeminal > facial) Point 3: They are at increased incidence of long bone fractures (lifelong prevalence, 40-60%). This is because calcified cartilage and thick trabeculae remain in the diaphysis, and cartilage has inferior mechanical properties to bone. Point 5: There is an increased incidence of coxa vara .
