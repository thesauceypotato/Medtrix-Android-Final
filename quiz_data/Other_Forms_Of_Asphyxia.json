      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Homicidal strangulation HOMICIDAL STRANGULATION : A strangulation is a common form of murder. Many victims are adult women, and strangulation is frequently associated with sexual assault. Usually, there is a single turn of a ligature around the neck, with one or more knots (granny or reef knots) at the front or side of the neck. When there are two or more firm knots, each on separate turns of the ligature, homicide is almost certain. A cord may be tied around the neck, twisted tightly using a stick or some other solid material inserted between the ligature and the skin, and twisted around several times (Spanish Windlass Technique).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Suicidal strangulation: Suicide by strangulation is rare. The victims employ various methods of tightening the ligature. The number of knots, tightness and method of knotting should be considered. The ligature is tightened like a tourniquet, but the person can apply a single or double knot before losing consciousness. In most cases, some mechanical device is always made to keep the ligature tight after insensibility develops. Several turns of rope are tied around the neck with a knot which is usually single and in front or at the side or back of the neck. A running noose is applied to the neck, and the free end of the rope to which a weight is attached is thrown over the end of the bed on which the victim lies. A person may strangle himself by leaning with the whole body weight on a cord passed around the neck and attached to a fixed point. Option: D. Accidental strangulation: Children may get entangled in ropes during play, or the neck may be caught in window cords, etc. Infants are sometimes strangled in their cots when the neck is caught inside bars, in restraints, braces, etc. Occasionally, an infant is strangled with a string attached to a toy tied to the crib. Persons under the influence of alcohol, epileptics, and imbeciles may be strangled by a tight scarf or collar and necktie. It may occur if an intoxicated person rests their neck against a bar or other hard object. It may occur when a string used in suspending a weight on the back slips from across the forehead and compresses the neck.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Mugging Strangulation is caused by holding the neck of the victim in the bend of the elbow. The forearm and upper arm exert pressure in front of the larynx or at one or both sides of the neck. The attack is usually made from behind. The postmortem appearances are those of ligature strangulation with a broad object, i.e. the signs are minimal. Sometimes, a diffuse abrasion may be seen along the margin of the jaw due to the friction of the forearm. Internally, there may be diffuse bruising, which may be slight or absent. There may be bruising behind the larynx and in the strap muscles of the neck. Fracture of the superior horn of the thyroid or hyoid is rare. Sometimes, the neck may be pressed by the foot or knee. The larynx and trachea will be crushed when the neck is stamped on repeatedly. And bleeding in the soft tissues with swelling. Death may occur due to asphyxia or reflex cardiac arrest</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. GARROTTING : The victim is attacked from behind without warning. The throat may be grasped, or a ligature is thrown over the neck and quickly tightened, twisting it with a lever (rod, stick, ruler, etc.), within the ligature. The assailant can then tie the ligature with one or more turns. In this way, a single assailant can kill a healthy adult male. This method is usually used in lonely places to kill travellers and rob them. This method had a refinement in which the neck was forced against a sharp spike penetrating the spinal cord. This results in a sudden loss of consciousness and collapse. Garotting as a mode of judicial execution was once employed in Spain. An iron collar around the neck was tightened by a screw for strangling (Spanish Windlass). Option: C. COMPRESSION OF THE NECK : This broad term is used for non-specific causes of neck pressure, which may be sudden. In hard compressions, such as kicking or stamping or jumping on the neck, or karate chops, and flying kicks, soft tissues are grossly damaged. There may be a vertical fracture of the laminae of the thyroid cartilage, cricoid or upper tracheal rings. Hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage tend to be flattened and broken outwards. Death may be rapid with crush injury and seepage of blood into the tissues, or it may be asphyxial due to swelling or airway obstruction. Surgical emphysema may be present. Soft, prolonged neck compression occurs in wrestling, carotid sleeper holds and choke holds. Option: D. SMOTHERING: This is a form of asphyxia caused by closing the external respiratory orifices either by the hand or by other means or blocking up the cavities of the nose and mouth by introducing a foreign substance, such as mud, paper, cloth, etc.</p>\n<p></p>",

A victim, usually alone or away from the family, was invited to William Burke and William Hare\u2019s house and given alcohol. Then the victim was thrown to the ground, and Burke used to kneel or sit on the chest and close the nose and mouth with his hands, and Hare used to pull him round the room by the feet.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All of the above Traumatic asphyxia results from respiratory arrest due to mechanical fixation of the chest by an unyielding substance or object so that the regular movements of the chest wall are prevented. Fatal cases are only due to accidents. Usually, there is a gross compression of the chest and usually the abdomen by a powerful force, which prevents chest expansion and diaphragmatic lowering. Causes: Multiple deaths are likely to occur when there is an outbreak of fire in a theatre or whenever large crowds gather in an enclosed place. The weight of the crowd crushes some, the chest being pressed violently, or may even get trampled on and crushed under feet (riot crush or human pile deaths). Another common cause is crushing by falls of earth or stone, usually in a coal mine, during tunnelling, or in a building collapse, even if the head remains above the fallen soil. Similarly, burial in grain, sand, coal or mineral may have the same effect. Sometimes, the victim is pressed to the ground by some heavyweight as a motor vehicle or other machinery. A person repairing a car may be crushed when the jack slips, and the vehicle falls on top of him. It may occur in assault cases, where the victim is jumped, stamped upon, and crushed by one or more assailants. It occurs in industrial disasters, earthquakes and landslides. Occasionally, it results from indirect compression, when the body is subjected to force so that his thighs and the knees are driven against his chest, the so-called \"jack-knife\" position.</p>\n<p></p>",

The degree of asphyxia produced by mechanical means is controlled, but in some cases, death occurs accidentally. These cases are associated with some form of abnormal sexual behaviour. Usually, masochism and transvestism. The victims are almost always males and usually young. The scene is usually the victim's house; the bedroom, bathroom, basement or attic are usually selected, and the door is locked inside. Adult males with homosexual preferences tend to carry out the procedure in pairs as a means of protection from accidental death.
