Along with that, the x-ray shows multiple lytic lesions. Lab investigation shows anemia, hypercalcemia and deranged RFT. The skull demonstrates the typical \u201cpunched out\u201d lesions characteristic of MM. So the diagnosis for this patient is suggestive of multiple myeloma. In these patients, lytic lesions are formed due to elevated IL-6, IL-3 and MIP 1 alpha which directly increases the action of osteoclasts. Also, DKK-1 inhibits osteoblast differentiation which also plays a role in this So the correct answer to this question will be option D.</p>\n<p></p>",
