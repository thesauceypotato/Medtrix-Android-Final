Tourette syndrome is characterized by multiple motors and one or more vocal tics that present before age 18 ; it occurs more frequently in males .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The tics occur many times a day (frequently in bouts) nearly every day or at regular intervals for at least a year. Motor tics frequently observed include grimacing, eye blinking, nose twitching, head jerking, and shoulder shrugging. Vocal tics include barking, grunting, squeaking, coughing, and throat clearing In a minority of cases, patients experience coprolalia (uttering obscene words). Symptoms are exacerbated by stress and tend to subside during sleep . Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are the most prevalent comorbid conditions .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A. There is an increased incidence of autism spectrum disorder in patients with Tourette syndrome, but ADHD and OCD are more common comorbid conditions. Autistic behaviors, when present, are typically evident from an early age and appear before the onset of tics. Option: C. There is no known association of Tourette syndrome with a seizure disorder. Option: D. Patients with Tourette syndrome may have significant psychosocial impairment and are at increased risk for anxiety disorders and depression . However, these disorders are not as common as ADHD and OCD .</p>\n<p></p>",

Although the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine is effective in treating OCD, it is considered second-line due to poorer tolerability and safety compared to SSRls.

Dialectical behavior therapy (which focuses on treating distress, emotional dysregulation, and self-harm in borderline personality disorder) has not demonstrated efficacy for OCD. Option: D.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is represented by a diverse group of symptoms that include intrusive thoughts, rituals, preoccupations, and compulsions . These recurrent obsessions or compulsions cause severe distress to the person.

Various functional brain-imaging studies-for example, positron emission tomography (PET)-have shown increased activity (e.g., metabolism and blood flow) in the frontal lobes, the basal ganglia (especially the caudate), and the cingulum of patients with OCD. Pharmacological and behavioral treatments reportedly reverse these abnormalities. Both computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have found bilaterally smaller caudate in patients with OCD. Both functional and structural brain-imaging study results are also compatible with the observation that neurological procedures involving the cingulum are sometimes effective in the treatment of OCD.</p>\n<p></p>",
