Since there is female-to-male transmission (paternal aunt and her son) , the disease gene could be either X-linked or Autosomal . Since there is male-to-male transmission (patient\u2019s father to the patient) , the disease cannot be X-linked . Therefore, the disease gene must be autosomal . If multiple and successive generations are affected, the disease is most likely autosomal dominant and therefore has a 50% average recurrence risk for any progeny if one parent is affected . If multiple generations are unaffected, the disease would be more likely to be transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner, with a 25% recurrence risk if both parents are carriers.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.

It is not necessary to know the sex of the child since the pedigree shows that transmission of the disease is independent of the sex of the progeny .</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>X linked recessive, ATP7A The given disease manifests only in males ; therefore, it is sex-linked disease females are not affected , so they must be careers . This is a classical feature of X-linked recessive disorders. All sex-linked disorders are X-linked, and almost all are recessive. Several genes are located in the male-specific region of Y, all related to spermatogenesis. Males with mutations affecting the Y-linked genes are usually infertile; hence, there is no Y-linked inheritance. X-linked recessive inheritance accounts for a small number of well-defined clinical conditions. For the most part, the Y chromosome is not homologous to the X chromosome, so mutant genes on the X chromosome do not have corresponding alleles on the Y chromosome. Thus, males are said to be Hemizygous for X-linked mutant genes, so these disorders are expressed in males. Other features characterising these disorders are as follows: An affected male does not transmit the disorder to his sons, but all daughters are carriers. Of course, sons of heterozygous women have one chance in two of receiving the mutant gene. A heterozygous female usually does not express the complete phenotypic change because of the paired normal allele. Because of the random inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in the female, females have a variable proportion of cells in which the mutant X chromosome is active. Thus, the normal allele can be inactivated in most cells, permitting full expression of heterozygous X-linked conditions in females .

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>25 per cent Achondroplasia is autosomal dominant , so only one out of four children will be unaffected , which is 25% of the chances of having a normal child. Autosomal dominant disorders are manifested in the heterozygous state, so at least one parent of an index case is usually affected; both males and females are affected, and both can transmit the condition. When an affected person marries an unaffected one, every child has one chance in two of having the disease. In addition to these basic rules, autosomal dominant conditions are characterised by the following: With every autosomal dominant disorder, some patients do not have affected parents . Such patients owe their disorder to new mutations involving either the egg or the sperm they derived from . Their siblings are neither affected nor at increased risk for disease development . The proportion of patients who develop the disease due to a new mutation is related to the effect of the disease on reproductive capability. If a disease markedly reduces reproductive fitness, most cases would be expected to result from new mutations.
