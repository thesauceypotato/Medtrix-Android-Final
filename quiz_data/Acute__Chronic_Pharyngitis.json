Clinical features of Ludwig\u2019s angina: There is marked difficulty in swallowing (odynophagia) with varying degrees of trismus. When infection is localised to the sublingual space, structures in the floor of the mouth are swollen, and the tongue seems to be pushed up and back. When the infection spreads to the submaxillary space, submental and submandibular regions become swollen and tender, imparting a woody-hard feel. Usually, there is cellulitis of the tissues rather than a frank abscess. The tongue is progressively pushed upwards and backwards, threatening the airway. Laryngeal oedema may appear. Ludwig's angina in a 7-year-old child.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Erysipelas is a superficial form of cellulitis. Option: C. In epiglottitis, Sore throat and dysphagia are the common presenting symptoms in adults. Dyspnoea and stridor are the common presenting symptoms in children. They are rapidly progressive. Fever may go up to 40 \u00b0C. It is due to septicaemia. Option: D. In orbital cellulitis, Clinical features include oedema of lids, exophthalmos, chemosis of the conjunctiva and restricted eyeball movements. Vision is affected, causing partial or total loss, sometimes permanent.</p>\n<p></p>",
