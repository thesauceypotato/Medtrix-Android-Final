Diabetic retinopathy is a long-term complication of diabetes due to microvascular ischemia and osmotic damage secondary to the chronic elevation in serum glucose. The molecular pathogenesis of these changes involves intraocular sorbitol accumulation , which consumes NADPH and leads to oxidative stress. This oxidative stress ultimately leads to damage to the retinal microvasculature .

All three images of Fluorescein angiography are examples of Hypoflourescence.
