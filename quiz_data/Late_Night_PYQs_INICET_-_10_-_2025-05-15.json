It also plays a role in taste sensation for the posterior third of the tongue.</li><li>\u2022 The motor branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve are responsible for controlling the muscles of the pharynx and the parotid gland, which is a salivary gland located in the cheek. Dysfunction of the glossopharyngeal nerve can result in symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, decreased taste sensation, and a decreased gag reflex.</li><li>\u2022 The glossopharyngeal nerve leaves the skull through the anteromedial part of the jugular foramen in a separate dural sheath.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

Its primary function is to regulate calcium homeostasis in the body, ensuring that blood calcium levels remain within a narrow and critical range. Increase in Blood Calcium: PTH increases blood calcium levels by stimulating various physiological processes: Stimulation of Osteoclasts: PTH activates osteoclasts, specialized bone cells responsible for breaking down bone tissue. This results in the release of calcium from the bones into the bloodstream. Enhanced Calcium Reabsorption: PTH enhances the reabsorption of calcium by the kidneys. This means that less calcium is excreted in urine, conserving it for use in the body. Activation of Vitamin D: PTH indirectly stimulates the production of active vitamin D (calcitriol) in the kidneys. Calcitriol helps increase calcium absorption from the digestive tract, further contributing to higher blood calcium levels. Negative Feedback Loop: The regulation of PTH secretion is tightly controlled by a negative feedback loop. When blood calcium levels drop below the normal range, the parathyroid glands release PTH, which acts to raise calcium levels. Once calcium levels return to normal, PTH secretion decreases, preventing excess calcium in the blood.</li><li>\u27a4 Role of PTH in Calcium Regulation: PTH is a hormone produced by the parathyroid glands, which are small glands located in the neck.
