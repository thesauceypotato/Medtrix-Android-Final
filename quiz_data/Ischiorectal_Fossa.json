The fascia of the canal is fused with the lower part of the obturator fascia laterally, with the lunate fascia above, with the perianal fascia medially, and with the falciform process of the sacrotuberous ligament below.

The fat in this space is loosely arranged in large loculi formed by incomplete delicate septa.

It begins laterally at the pudendal canal and merges medially with the fascia covering the deep part of the external anal sphincter. The fascia divides the ischioanal space into: Suprategmental space, above the fascia. Tegmental space, below the fascia.</p>\n<p></p>",
