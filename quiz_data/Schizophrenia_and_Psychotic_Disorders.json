      "explanation": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u2022 (C) Paranoid personality disorder \u2013 Incorrect. Paranoid personality disorder is a personality disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of distrust and suspiciousness of others, where the individual believes others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving them. However, this disorder does not involve specific delusions like the one seen in this patient. The patient's delusional belief (someone is poisoning her food) is more fixed and specific than the general suspiciousness seen in paranoid personality disorder, and it is the hallmark of delusional disorder, not a personality disorder.</li><li>\u2022 (D) Schizophrenia \u2013 Incorrect. Schizophrenia typically presents with multiple psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and disorganized or catatonic behavior, and these symptoms must last for at least 6 months. This patient\u2019s symptoms are limited to a specific delusion about food poisoning, and there are no other psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or disorganized behavior. Additionally, her functioning in other areas of life, such as her job and promotion, is preserved, which is not typical in schizophrenia.</li><li>\u2022 (E) Schizophreniform disorder \u2013 Incorrect. Schizophreniform disorder is similar to schizophrenia but is diagnosed when psychotic symptoms are present for at least 1 month but less than 6 months. This diagnosis would require the presence of multiple psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech/behavior) and significant functional impairment, which is not the case in this patient. The patient\u2019s symptoms are limited to a delusion without the accompanying symptoms or significant functional impairment.</li><li>\u2022 (F) Schizotypal personality disorder \u2013 Incorrect. Schizotypal personality disorder is a personality disorder marked by eccentric behavior, odd beliefs, and social deficits, but delusions are not a defining characteristic. The patient's fixed belief about food poisoning is more indicative of delusional disorder than of schizotypal personality disorder, which typically involves odd beliefs or magical thinking without fixed delusions.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
