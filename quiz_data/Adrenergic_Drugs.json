Only the primary transmitter substances are shown. Parasympathetic ganglia are not shown because most are in or near the wall of the organ inner- vated. Cholinergic nerves are shown in blue, noradrenergic in red. Note that some sympathetic postganglionic fibers release acetylcholine rather than norepinephrine. Sympathetic nerves to the renal vasculature and kidney may release dopamine as well as norepinephrine during stress. The adrenal medulla, a modified sympathetic ganglion, receives sympathetic preganglionic fibers and releases epinephrine and nor- epinephrine into the blood. Not shown are the sacral preganglionic fibers that innervate the rectum, bladder, and genitalia. These fibers are probably sympathetic preganglionic nerves with cholinergic postganglionic fibers (see Box: Sympathetic Sacral Outflow).

Administration of calcium gluconate decreases membrane excitability. The effect begins within minutes but is short-lived (30-60 min), and the dose can be repeated if no change in the electrocardiogram is seen after 5-10 min. Insulin causes K' to shift into cells and will temporarily lower the plasma K' concentration. Although glucose alone will stimulate insulin release from normal pancreatic beta cells, a more rapid response generally occurs when exogenous insulin is administered (with glucose to prevent hypoglycemia). The plasma K concentration will fall by 0.5-1.5 mmol/L in 15-30 min, and the effect will last for several hours. Alkali therapy with intravenous NaHCO, can also shift K' into cells. This should be reserved for severe hyperkalemia associated with metabolic acidosis. Patients with end-stage renal disease seldom respond to this intervention and may not tolerate the Na\" load and resultant volume expansion. When administered parenterally or in nebulized form, beta 2-adrenergic agonists promote cellular uptake of K\". The onset of action is 30 min and the effect lasts 2-4 h. Therefore, from the above discussion, the fastest-acting drug in hyperkalemia is calcium gluconate but it does not reduce potassium level and only counteracts the ECG changes induced by K. For reducing the potassium level quickly, the drug is glucose insulin.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Insulin dextrose ( option A ), Calcium gluconate ( option B ), and Salbutamol ( option D ) which is a Beta agonist are used in the immediate management of hyperkalemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Magnesium Benefits Every Organ in the body needs\nmagnesium, especially the heart, kidneys and bones, Coffee, Soda, Alcohol and\nstress can lead to magnesium deficiciency.
