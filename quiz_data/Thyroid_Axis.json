The thyroid hormone exists in two forms: triiodothyronine (T3), and tetraiodothyronine (T4). Both circulate in the blood bound to plasma proteins, but at the cellular level, T4 is converted to T3, which then binds to thyroid hormone receptors. The thyroid hormone is essential for normal brain development in the perinatal period. The thyroid hormone stimulates oxidative metabolism in all tissues except the brain, spleen, and testis. ATP utilization and heat production is increased.

The oxidation and reaction of iodide with the secreted thyroglobulin are mediated by thyroid peroxidase, a membrane-bound enzyme found in the thyrocyte apical membrane. The thyroid hormones so produced remain part of the thyroglobulin molecule until needed. As such, colloid represents a reservoir of thyroid hormones. When there is a need for thyroid hormone secretion, the colloid is internalized by the thyrocytes by endocytosis, and directed toward lysosomal degradation. Thyrocytes thus have four functions: They collect and transport iodine, they synthesize thyroglobulin and secrete it into the colloid, they fix iodine to the thyroglobulin to generate thyroid hormones, and they remove the thyroid hormones from thyroglobulin and secrete them into the circulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Functions of thyroid cells:- Option A.

The colloid has hormone reserves for 2-3 months Release: Iodinated thyroglobulin is taken up by the thyroid follicles via endocytosis and fuses with lysosomes. It is cleaved by lysosomal proteolytic enzymes into MIT, DIT, T3, and T4. T4 (80%) and T3 (20%) are released into the blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. The major hormonal product of the coupling reaction is the molecule thyroxine (T4), which is formed when two molecules of diiodotyrosine are joined together; the thyroxine then remains part of the thyroglobulin molecule. Option B. One molecule of monoiodotyrosine couples with one molecule of diiodotyrosine to form triiodothyronine (T3), which represents about one-fifteenth of the final hormones. Option C. Small amounts of reverse T3 (rT3) are formed by the coupling of diiodotyrosine with monoiodotyrosine , but RT3 does not appear to be of functional significance in humans.</p>\n<p></p>",
