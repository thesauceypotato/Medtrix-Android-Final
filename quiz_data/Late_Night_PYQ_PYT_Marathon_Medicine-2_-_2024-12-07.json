D) In severe aortic regurgitation, the murmur has a briefer duration</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 The murmur associated with severe aortic regurgitation is significantly shorter in duration compared to the murmur of mild aortic regurgitation. In mild cases, the regurgitant murmur is longer because the pressure gradient between the aorta and left ventricle takes more time to equalize. However, as the severity of the regurgitation increases, this pressure equalization occurs more rapidly, resulting in a markedly shortened murmur duration.</li><li>\u2022 While the intensity of the murmur may increase slightly with severe regurgitation, the most notable difference lies in the considerably reduced duration of the murmur. Regardless of severity, the typical aortic regurgitation murmur is a high-pitched, early diastolic, decrescendo murmur best heard at Erb's point (the third intercostal space on the left) with the patient sitting up, leaning forward, and at end-expiration.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

The striatum, which includes the caudate nucleus and putamen, plays a critical role in the modulation of movement. Damage or dysfunction in this area disrupts the normal inhibitory and excitatory signals necessary for smooth and controlled motion. This disruption often leads to the characteristic jerky movements associated with chorea.

These clinical features strongly suggest deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The sudden shortness of breath indicates that a thrombus from the DVT has likely embolized to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. This is a common and potentially life-threatening complication in bedridden patients.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Pulmonary edema: This is characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs, typically secondary to heart failure, and does not present with a swollen, red limb or calf pain.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Cerebral embolism:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Paradoxical embolism: This occurs when a thrombus passes from the venous to the arterial system through a cardiac shunt (e.g., patent foramen ovale).
