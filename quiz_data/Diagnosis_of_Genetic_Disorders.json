This disorder is marked by the accumulation of toxic levels of copper in many tissues and organs, principally the liver, brain, and eye. Toxic brain injury primarily involves the basal ganglia . Nearly all patients with neurologic involvement develop eye lesions called Kayser-Fleischer rings , green to brown deposits of copper in the Descemet membrane in the limbus of the cornea. The biochemical diagnosis of Wilson disease is usually based on the presence of decreased serum ceruloplasmin, increased hepatic copper content (the most sensitive and accurate test), and increased urinary excretion of copper (the most specific test). Treatment: Early recognition and long-term copper chelation therapy (with D-penicillamine or trientine) or zinc-based therapy (which blocks the uptake of dietary copper in the gut) is effective. Individuals with hepatitis or unmanageable cirrhosis require liver transplantation, which can be curative.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Wilson's disease is an example. True , in Wilson's disease there's a mutation in the the ATP7B gene on Chromosome 13 . Excess copper accumulated in the liver, brain, and other vital organs . Option: C. Causes disease only in the homozygous state of alleles. Autosomal recessive traits are transmitted to both sexes and both males and females can be carriers. Because the gene is recessive, affected persons (who are homozygous for the gene) typically have parents and offspring who are unaffected ( heterozygous ) carriers . Option: D. Most enzyme deficiency disorders follow this pattern. True , many enzyme deficiency disorders follow an autosomal recessive pattern .</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Modes of inheritance: Autosomal Dominant: Autosomal Dominant Disorders System Disorder Nervous Huntington disease Neurofibromatosis Myotonic dystrophy Tuberous sclerosis Urinary Polycystic kidney disease Gastrointestinal Familial polyposis coli Hematopoietic Hereditary spherocytosis von Willebrand disease Skeletal Marfan syndrome\u00aa Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (some variants)\u00aa Osteogenesis imperfecta Achondroplasia Metabolic Familial hypercholesterolemia Acute intermittent porphyria</p>\n<p></p>",
