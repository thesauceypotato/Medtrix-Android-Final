For example- The pins at the yoke of oxygen are at 2 and 5 positions. Oxygen cylinders have holes at the same position making only oxygen cylinders possible to be placed at this position.

Option C - To prevent static current, the equipment coming in contact with the patient (like a face mask) or coming in contact with the floor (like OT shoes, tyres of the trolley) are made antistatic by adding carbon to them.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Equal to minute volume It is the Magill circuit Fresh gases from the machine (shown as a continuous line in the diagram-) reaches the patient. Most of the expired gasses from the patient (broken lines) are exhaled from the pressure relief valve however some of the gases go back into the tubing (that is why these circuits are called semiopen circuits). These expiratory gasses which have gone back in the tubing may be re-inhaled by the patient in the next This is called rebreathing (patient rebreathing his/her expired gases). To prevent this rebreathing there are recommendations for fresh gas flow for each circuit; fresh gas flow should be sufficient enough to push these expiratory gases out in the atmosphere through the expiratory valve before getting delivered to the patient. For Magill circuit, fresh gas flow should be equal to minute volume to prevent rebreathing in a spontaneously breathing patient. If this circuit is used for controlled ventilation (no spontaneous breathing, the patient is on artificial ventilation) very high flows (3 times of minute volume or > 20 L) are required and in spite of such high flows prevention of rebreathing is still unpredictable therefore Magill circuit should not be used for controlled ventilation. It is the circuit of choice for spontaneous ventilation.</p>\n<p></p>",
