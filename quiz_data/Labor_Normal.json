Method of pushing (for women with epidural analgesia) For women with epidural analgesia in the second stage of labor, delaying pushing for one to two hours after full dilatation or until the woman regains the sensory urge to bear down is recommended in the context where resources are available for longer stay in second stage and perinatal hypoxia can be adequately assessed and managed. Techniques for preventing perineal trauma. For women in the second stage of labor, techniques to reduce perineal trauma and facilitate spontaneous birth (including perineal massage, warm compresses and a \u201chands on\u201d guarding of the perineum) are recommended, based on a woman\u2019s preferences and available options.
