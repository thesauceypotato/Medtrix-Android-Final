      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Death rate declines more than the birth rate The history of world population since 1650 suggests that there is a demographic cycle of 5 stages through which a nation passes: (1) FIRST STAGE (High stationary) It is characterized by both A high birth rate and A high death rate Therefore they both cancel each other, and the population remains stationary. It is seen when the country is economically weak. India was in this stage till 1920 (2) SECOND STAGE (Early expanding) It begins with the Declining in death rate while The birth rate remains high/unchanged. As a result, a huge increase in population occurs. The DR decline is mainly due to improvements in the food supply, health care, and sanitation. At present many developing countries in Asia and Africa is in this stage. The BRs have increased in some of these countries probably because of the following: Improved health care provisions, and Shortening periods of breast-feeding (3) THIRD STAGE (Late expanding) Death rate declines further and The birth rate now begins to fall. However, as the BR still exceeds the DR, there is an increase in the population. The fall in BR results mostly from access to contraceptives, women empowerment, India appears to be at this stage. In some developing countries (e.g., China, Singapore), birth rates have declined fast. (4) FOURTH STAGE (Low stationary) This stage is characterized with Low birth rate and Low death rate. Consequently, the population remains stationary. An aging population is a feature of this stage. Japan, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, and Switzerland are in this stage. Most industrialized countries have undergone a demographic transition. From a high BR and high DR To low BR and low DR Zero population growth was recorded in Austria during 1980- 85. Growth rate as low as 0.1 was recorded in the UK, Denmark, Sweden, and Belgium during 1980-85. (5) FIFTH STAGE: (Declining) Birth rate is now lower than the death rate. Hence the population begins to decline Some East European countries (e.g., Germany, and Hungary) and some North European countries (e.g., Sweden, Norway) are now in this stage</p>\n<p></p>",

The graph shows male and female population percentages in all age groups by dividing the x-axis into male and female, with males on the left side and females on the right side. The age pyramid of India is typical of any other developing country with a broad base and a tapering top, hence appearing as a triangle. This means that India has a higher percentage of children and young individuals, and as the age increases, the percentage decreases. India has a very less percentage of the geriatric population. In developed countries, the pyramid shows a bulge in the middle and has a narrow base.</p>\n<p></p>",

Two methods have been used to measure contraceptive efficacy- Pearl Index & Life table analysis. Life table analysis calculates a failure rate for each month of use. A cumulative failure rate can then compare methods for any specific length of exposure. Women who leave a study for any reason other than unintended pregnancy are removed from the analysis, contributing to their exposure until the time of the exit.

Couple Protection rate is an indicator of the prevalence of the contraceptive practice in the community.

Spermicide jellies, foams, creams, contain surface active agents that damage the sperm cell membrane and inhibit oxygen uptake by perms and kill them. It, however, does not provide any protection against STDs. Oral Contraceptives offer couples a wide range of options for delaying, spacing, and limiting births. Oral contraceptives are safe, effective, and reversible methods of contraception however, they do not protect a woman from HIV or other Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). Women using oral contraceptives must use condoms to prevent HIV or other STIs.</p>\n<p></p>",

But a simpler method is adopted in developing countries wherein microscopic examination of a smear is prepared by gentle squeezing of the vas on a glass slide and staining with Wright\u2019s stain. The vas can be identified by the presence of columnar epithelial cells that line the lumen of the vas. Other causes of failure may be due to spontaneous recanalization of the vas.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is based on the observation of changes in the characteristic of cervical mucus. At the time of ovulation, the cervical mucus becomes watery and clear as raw egg white. After ovulation, the mucus thickens and lessens in quantity. Option: C.

This is known as lactational amenorrhoea Exclusive breastfeeding suppresses woman\u2019s fertility in early months after delivery due to an increase in prolactin, which inhibits ovulation. Lactational amenorrhoea is effective until her menstrual period has not returned since delivery, if she is breastfeeding exclusively and on-demand, both during day and night and the baby is less than 6 months old. By and large, by 6 months after childbirth, about 20-50% of women are menstruating and are in need of conception. Billings\u2019s method: There occur some changes in the consistency of cervical mucus during the menstrual cycle, due to hormonal variations, which can be observed by touch or by toilet paper. Appearance of mucus marks the fertile period, which is usually 4-7 days prior to ovulation. Mucus has an \u2018egg white\u2019 consistency, and the couple may abstain from sex during this period. Calender method: It takes into account the duration of the cycle in the last one year. To estimate the fertile period, subtract 18 from the total duration of the shortest recorded cycle and 11 from that of the longest recorded cycle in the last one year. Yuzpe method: Yuzpe method is an emergency contraception regimen wherein 2 doses of combined estrogen-progesterone 12 hours apart within 72 hours of unprotected sex are given.</p>\n<p></p>",

Over 10 years of use, the failure rate has been seen to be 2 per hundred women per year. Coitus interruptus is a method in which a male partner withdraws before ejaculation and thereby tries to prevent deposition of semen into the vagina. The chief drawback of this method is that the pre-coital secretion of the male may contain sperm and may cause pregnancy. Hence it has a failure rate of as high as 25%, so not advised.
