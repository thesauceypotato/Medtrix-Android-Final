Distal femur fractures in children can have various fracture patterns, including supracondylar fractures, or fractures of any pattern from the Salter-Harris classification. Salter-Harris II fractures of the distal femur are the most common pattern in children. Even though distal femur fractures are relatively uncommon injuries, they can have significant implications for limb alignment and future growth. Distal femur fractures in children are typically related to trauma, such as falls, motor vehicle accidents, or contact sports. Patients have pain, swelling about the knee, deformity, and an inability to bear weight on the affected leg. Closed manipulation and casting is an option in displaced fractures, although they have significant potential for instability, which could lead to malunion.
