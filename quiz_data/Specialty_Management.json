Therefore, ventilation has to be achieved through the ventilation port of the bronchoscope. This port is too narrow to allow only a few ml of tidal volume. So, minute volume needs to be compensated by increasing the respiratory rate. A special device called high frequency jet ventilation can deliver high frequency (respiratory rate) up to 2000 breaths/minutes.

Maintenance- Although Desflurane has the lowest blood gas coefficient, a recent meta analysis has shown that the difference in recovery time between Desflurane and Sevoflurane is just 1.0-1.2 minutes which is clinically insignificant. Therefore, due to less cost and better respiratory (bronchodilatation, less airway irritation) and cardiac profile (Desflurane can cause tachycardia and hypertension), Sevoflurane is now preferred over desflurane for daycare surgeries. Muscle relaxant- Mivacurium being the shortest-acting non-depolarizer is the muscle relaxant of choice for daycare surgery. Analgesic- Remifentanil being metabolized by RBC esterase, has a short half-life of 10 minutes therefore is the opioid of choice for daycare surgery. Benzodiazepine: Midazolam, having a half-life of 2 hours, is the benzodiazepine of choice for daycare surgery.</p>\n<p></p>",
