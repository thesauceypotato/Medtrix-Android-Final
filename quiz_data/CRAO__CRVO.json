Fundus examination shows Marked narrowing of retinal arteries and mild narrowing of retinal veins. The retina becomes milky white due to ischaemic edema.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Placement of patient in Trendelenburg position Risk factors for expulsive choroidal Hemorrhage include myopia, glaucoma, Atherosclerotic vascular disease, hypertension, and previous expulsive hemorrhage in the opposite eye. Using as small an incision as possible along with being ready to perform a sclerotomy is important. Rapid wound closure is required once this complication is recognized to prevent iris prolapse and expulsion of the lens, vitreous, and blood . Sclerotomies may also be performed using a blade or trephine to drain blood posterior to the ora serrata.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>It occurs in approximately 1% of cases and causes a forward shift of the iris-lens diaphragm , with prolapse of posterior structures and a change in the red reflex.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B . Decompression before opening the globe with digital pressure or another device such as a Honan balloon may be helpful. Option: C .The wound should be closed with nonabsorbable, preferably nylon sutures to prevent delayed hemorrhage . It is also beneficial to keep blood pressure controlled and the level of anesthesia deep (if general anesthesia is used) during surgery. Option: D . Shelved or self-sealing incisions allow more rapid closure and depressurization of the globe should bleeding occur. Placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position would increase Pressure around the eye, thus increasing the chance of having an expulsive hemorrhage.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Choroidal hemorrhage is the most sight-threatening complication of cataract surgery, its incidence is fortunately low</p>\n<p></p>",
