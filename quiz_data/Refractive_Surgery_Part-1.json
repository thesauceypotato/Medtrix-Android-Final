In this, a donor corneal tissue is attached to the host cornea after removal of the epithelium.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Indications of Epikeratophakia : Treatment of Keratoconus Refractive errors like myopia and high hypermetropia, including aphakia, cannot be corrected with conservative methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. In keratomileusis , corneal tissue is resected and modified in shape before replacement. Option: C. Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is a type of excimer laser refractive surgery in which the cornea's surface is ablated by laser in the procedure. Option: D. Radial keratotomy is a technique in which radial incisions are made in the cornea.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Common Complications of epikeratophakia include delayed postoperative visual recovery reduced best-corrected visual acuity prolonged epithelial defects irregular astigmatism</p>\n<p></p>",
