There are widespread cerebral contusions, most prominent in the left frontal lobe . There is traumatic subarachnoid blood in the third and lateral ventricles .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Extradural hematoma is a neurosurgical emergency. It results from an artery, vein, or venous sinus rupture associated with a skull fracture. The classical injury is a fracture to the thin squamous temporal bone, with associated damage to the middle meningeal artery. Presentation : Transient loss of consciousness is typical, and the patient may then present in the subsequent lucid interval with a headache but without any neurological deficit. As the hematoma expands, compensation is exhausted with rapid deterioration. There is contralateral hemiparesis, a reduced conscious level, and ipsilateral pupillary dilatation , the cardinal signs of brain compression and herniation. Although this \u2018talk and die\u2019 pattern of deterioration occurs in only one-third of cases, it is critically important to recognize the potential for rapid avoidable secondary brain injury in patients who present neurologically intact. Diagnosis : On CT, extradural hematomas appear as a lentiform (lens-shaped or biconvex) hyperdense lesion between the skull and the brain, constrained by the adherence of the dura to the head. A mass effect may be evident, with compression of the surrounding brain and midline shift. Areas of mixed density suggest active bleeding . A skull fracture will usually be apparent. Treatment : Open craniectomy for evacuation of the congealed clot and hemostasis generally is indicated for EDH. In some cases, EDH can be caused by self-limited bony venous bleeding that may not require surgical intervention. Typically, patients who meet the following criteria may be managed conservatively: clot volume <30 cm, maximum thickness <1.5 cm, and GCS score >8 . Prognosis : Prognosis after successful evacuation is better for EDH than subdural hematoma (SDH). EDHs are associated with lower-energy trauma with less resultant primary brain injury. Good outcomes may be seen in 85% to 90% of patients with rapid CT scans and intervention.11 In some cases, EDH can also be caused by dural venous sinus tears that rapidly expand and are typically associated with a high degree of morbidity when treated surgically</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Subdural Hematoma On head CT scan, the clot is bright(Hyperdense) or mixed-density, crescent-shaped (lunate), may have a less distinct border, and does not cross the midline due to the presence of the falx.

Option B: Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic effective against some Gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus species. However, it is not effective against Staphylococcus species or Gram-negative bacteria. Erythromycin also has a shorter half-life than cefazolin, meaning multiple doses are required for prevention. Therefore, erythromycin is not the preferred choice for prevention in cardiac surgery. Option D: Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that is effective against some Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, it is less effective than cefazolin against Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species. Doxycycline also has a shorter half-life than cefazolin, meaning multiple doses are required for prevention.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Sympathetic - bladder dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation Abdominoperineal resection (APR) is a surgical procedure that involves complete removal of the rectum, anal canal, and sphincter apparatus, resulting in the creation of a permanent colostomy. The inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) is the first vessel usually ligated during the procedure. However, a high IMA ligation during APR can cause sympathetic dysfunction, leading to retrograde ejaculation and bladder dysfunction due to injury to the superior hypogastric nerve. APR is often preferred in elderly patients with distal rectal cancer and poor sphincter function, as it offers a better quality of life. However, complications such as higher recurrence rates compared to low anterior resection, anastomotic leaks or dehiscences, necrosis of the transposed colon, bleeding, and strictures can occur. The rectum and genitourinary system are supplied by the sympathetic innervation from L1, L2, and L3, which form the superior hypogastric plexus. These nerves divide into left and right hypogastric nerves at the sacral promontory, providing innervation to the rectum and genitourinary system. Injuries to the pelvic mesh, nerve originates, or periprostatic net during APR can lead to erectile dysfunction, impotence, atonic bladder, sexual dysfunction, and bladder dysfunction.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Surgery for rectal cancer Surgery is the mainstay of curative therapy The primary resection consists of rectal resection performed by TME Early cancers (stages T1 and selected T2) may be suitable for local excision Most cases can be treated by anterior resection, with a colorectal or coloanal anastomosis being achieved with a circular stapling device Low, extensive tumors require an abdominoperineal excision with a permanent colostomy Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy can be used to downstage cancer and reduce local recurrence 'Watch and wait' non-operative management is an option for the 20% who have a complete clinical response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy</p>\n<p></p>",

Ingestion of alkali substances can cause severe damage to the esophagus, leading to total dysphagia or the inability to swallow. The initial management of these patients typically involves supportive care, including airway protection, fluid resuscitation, and pain control. However, since these injuries can lead to stricture formation, which can cause persistent dysphagia, additional management is often required. Feeding jejunostomy is a surgical procedure in which a tube is placed through the abdominal wall and into the jejunum, the second part of the small intestine. This tube allows for enteral feeding, bypassing the esophagus and stomach, and delivering nutrients directly to the small intestine. In patients with total dysphagia, this is necessary to prevent malnutrition and maintain adequate caloric intake while the esophagus heals.

The goal of treatment is to relieve pain, improve pancreatic function, and prevent complications. In the scenario presented, a pancreatic stone has been identified on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) in a patient with chronic pancreatitis. In such a scenario, the most appropriate management would be longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy . Longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy, also known as the Puestow procedure, involves creating a side-to-side anastomosis between the pancreas and a loop of jejunum, bypassing the obstructed pancreatic duct. This can relieve pain, prevent recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis, and improve pancreatic function.

Trypsinogen is normally inhibited and destroyed by SPINK1 if it becomes activated prematurely within the pancreas. Diagnosis is confirmed on abdominal CT imaging, which can show pancreatic calcifications, ductal strictures, and ductal dilatation. A \u201cchain of lakes\u201d appearance can sometimes be seen, which is caused by the alternating dilation and stricture of the main pancreatic duct. Pancreatic function tests (e.g., fecal elastase-1 measurement, 72-hour quantitative fecal fat test) can be used to assess the degree of pancreatic exocrine and enzyme deficiency Alcohol use disorder is the most common etiology of chronic pancreatitis, accounting for 60\u201370% of cases. Hereditary pancreatitis is an autosomal dominant disorder with an 80% penetrance and is associated with a gain-of-function mutation in the cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1) on chromosome 7, which leads to the production of a degradation-resistant form of trypsin. A loss-of-function mutation in SPINK1 is also linked to idiopathic pancreatitis. Some patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis have mutations in the CFTR gene. Patients with hereditary pancreatitis and those who develop pancreatitis at a young age, especially if they smoke tobacco, are at a significantly increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer.

Prophylactic endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is recommended for medium to large varices . Patients with acute variceal bleeding should be admitted to an ICU for resuscitation and management. Blood resuscitation should be performed until a hemoglobin level of 8 g/dL is reached. Short-term prophylactic antibiotics such as ceftriaxone 1g/day IV decrease the rate of bacterial infections and increase survival. Octreotide is preferred for initial management of acute variceal bleeding. Shunt therapy can control refractory variceal bleeding in >90% of treated individuals.

The initial treatment for this condition is medical treatment with metronidazole . The ingestion of Entamoeba histolytica cysts is the cause of intestinal diseases such as diarrhea. The trophozoites then reach the liver through the portal venous system and cause an amebic liver abscess. Common symptoms of this condition include right upper quadrant pain, tenderness, fever, hepatomegaly, and diarrhea. CT scans can differentiate between amoebic and pyogenic abscesses . A rim enhancement is noted in the case of a pyogenic abscess. The main treatment for amebic abscesses is metronidazole , which is curative in over 90% of patients. Luminal agents such as iodoquinol, paromomycin, or diloxanide furoate can be administered to treat the carrier state.

Amoebiasis can mimic ulcerative colitis clinically, with bloody diarrhea being the most common symptom. Severe complications such as hemorrhage, stricture formation, or perforation of the colon can occur. Pericolitis may result in adhesions that cause intestinal obstruction. Amoebiasis can cause liver abscesses or an amoebic mass (amoeboma) of the caecum or sigmoid, which can be difficult to distinguish from carcinoma.

Packing the peritoneal cavity with 20% hypertonic saline-soaked packs and instilling 20% hypertonic saline into the cyst before it is opened can help avoid contamination. A biliary communication should be actively sought and sutured during surgery. Packing the space with pedicled greater omentum can reduce the risk of infection and bile leaks. Calcified cysts may be dead, but if there is any doubt about the status of a suspected cyst, it can be monitored with ultrasonography.
