HS occurs in skin containing apocrine glands, commonly in the axillae and groins; but also the scalp, breast, chest and perineum. It appears to have a genetic predisposition with variable penetrance, and is strongly associated with obesity and smoking. It affects four women for every man. Patients should stop smoking and lose excess weight. Symptoms can be reduced by the use of antiseptic soaps, tea tree oil and wearing non-compressive and aerated underwear.

Predisposing conditions include: diabetes mellitus; smoking; penetrating trauma; pressure sores; immunosuppression; intravenous drug abuse; perineal infection (perianal abscess, Bartholin\u2019s cysts); and skin damage/infection (abrasions, bites, boils). Classical clinical signs include: oedema stretching beyond visible skin erythema; a woody-hard texture to the subcutaneous tissues; an inability to distinguish fascial planes and muscle groups on palpation; disproportionate pain in relation to the affected area, with associated skin vesicles and soft tissue crepitus. Management should commence with urgent fluid resuscitation, monitoring of hemodynamic status and administration of high-dose, intravenous broad spectrum, antibiotics. This is a surgical emergency and the diseased area should be debrided as soon as possible until viable, healthy, bleeding tissue is reached. Early surgical review and further debridement is advisable, together with the use of vacuum-assisted dressings.

For finger or toe nail lesions it is vital to biopsy the nail matrix, rather than just the pigment on the nail plate.
