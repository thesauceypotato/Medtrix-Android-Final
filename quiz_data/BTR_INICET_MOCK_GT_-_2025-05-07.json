A) At eight weeks the embryo is bipotent</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 At eight weeks of gestation, the embryo is no longer bipotent. The term \"bipotent\" refers to the embryo's capability to develop into either male or female structures, which is true up until about the sixth week of development. By the eighth week, sexual differentiation is already underway, with the influence of the SRY gene causing the gonads to differentiate into testes in 46XY embryos. This differentiation results in a shift away from bipotency, making the embryo committed to developing male characteristics.</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Wolffian duct develops into epididymis and vas deferens on either side of the body : This statement is true. The Wolffian ducts, under the influence of testosterone, develop into the male reproductive structures including the epididymis and vas deferens.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Wolffian duct develops into epididymis and vas deferens on either side of the body</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Mullerian inhibiting substance inhibits Mullerian duct : This statement is true. Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS), also known as anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), is produced by Sertoli cells in the testes and inhibits the development of the Mullerian ducts, which would otherwise develop into female reproductive structures such as the uterine tubes and uterus.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Mullerian inhibiting substance inhibits Mullerian duct</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Dihydrotestosterone leads to the development of secondary sexual characters and external genitalia : This statement is true. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent metabolite of testosterone, is crucial for the development of male external genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics such as facial hair and a deeper voice.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Dihydrotestosterone leads to the development of secondary sexual characters and external genitalia</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 At eight weeks of gestation, the embryo is no longer bipotent; sexual differentiation has already commenced.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
