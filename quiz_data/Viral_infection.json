Aka Kaposi varicelliform eruption Predisposing factors: Atopic dermatitis, sezary syndrome, Darier disease Hailey-Hailey disease, ichthyosis vulgaris, psoriasis and drug eruption high IgE level, antibodies against Malassezia sympodialis, low NK cell count, low levels of cathelicidin LL37 and human \u03b2-defensin abnormalities in the interferon pathway Characteristic lesions: Vesicular and ulcerative (commonly) Folliculitis, minor 'frictional ulcers' ( rare) The vesicles burst to form erosions covered by haemorrhagic crusts. The disorder can be prevented by preventing children with atopic dermatitis from coming into contact with individuals with cold sores. Treatment: Oozing and crusted areas need to be gently bathed with saline. Acyclovir should be given as early as possible orally. It can also be administered intravenously. Famciclovir is a similar drug that can be used. Some clinicians would also favour giving prophylactic antibiotics at the same time.

The clinical picture of measles can be divided into three stages: prodromal, eruptive, and convalescent. The eruptive is characterized by the appearance of a maculopapular rash, initially fine that subsequently becomes confluent which begins behind the auricle and the presence of Koplik\u2019s spot in buccaneers mucosa. Option D. HIV: Rarely produces pruritic papular eruptions.</p>\n<p></p>",
