      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Preservative Methylisothiazolinone (MI) is a preservative. MI was initially used occupationally , in paints, adhesives/glues and cleaners , , as a mixture with methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI). Since 2005, it has been widely used in cosmetics and household products , such as moist wipes, shampoos, cleaners, and liquid laundry products. When used in the industrial setting, MI was thought not to be a significant occupational allergen. Subsequently, following extensive domestic use, MI was found to be a strong allergen. It was responsible for an 'epidemic' of contact allergic dermatitis (2016). MI was named Contact Allergen of the Year in 2013 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society.</p>\n<p></p>",

The hands and feet, eyelids, and anogenital areas are common sites. Lesions in the oral mucosa are usually found on the lips, tongue, and hard palate. Option C. Dengue : Rash in dengue fever is a maculopapular or macular confluent rash over the face, thorax, and flexor surfaces, with islands of skin sparing. The rash typically begins on day 3 and persists for 2-3 days. A second rash may occur within 1-2 days of defervescence, lasting 1-5 days; it is morbilliform, is maculopapular, spares the palms and soles, and occasionally desquamates.</p>\n<p></p>",
