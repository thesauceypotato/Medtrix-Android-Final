Mechanism of action: Foscarnet is a structural mimic of the anion pyrophosphate that selectively inhibits the pyrophosphate binding site on viral DNA polymerases at concentrations that do not affect human DNA polymerases. It is used to treat herpes viruses, including drug-resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2). It is particularly used to treat CMV retinitis. it is nephrotoxic, so needs dose reduction in renal failure causes hypocalcaemia and needs regular electrolyte monitoring</p>\n<p></p>",
