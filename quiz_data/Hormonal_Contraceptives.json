According to British guidelines, raloxifene is not recommended for primary prophylaxis of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women but is an alternative option for secondary prevention and treatment of vertebral fractures , i.e. in those who have already suffered a fracture. It is also approved for the prevention of breast cancer in women with risk factors.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Clomiphene - Clomiphene citrate is used in the treatment of infertility , it acts by blocking negative feedback by estrogen and induces ovulation. Option: B. Leuprolide and C. Goserelin - are pulsatile GnRH agonists which can be used in the treatment of infertility.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Clomiphene - An estrogen receptor antagonist in most target tissues. Blockade of estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus counteracts the estrogen-induced negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. This effect often allows normal pulsatility of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release from the hypothalamus to occur, stimulating a normal pattern of follicle-stimulating hormone(FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) release from the anterior pituitary , resulting in ovulation. The drug has been used for more than 25 years to treat infertility when other causes have been ruled out. However, clomiphene may exhibit negative effects, including an increased incidence of multiple births, ovarian cysts, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.</p>\n<p></p>",

Excessive bleeding attending anovulatory cycles is diminished & it is also approved for use in dysfunctional uterine bleeding.
