In fact, early pregnancy has been associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Risk factors for Breast cancer Risk factors Explanation Age The risk of breast cancer increases with age, with the majority of cases occurring in women over the age of 50. Family History Having a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) with breast cancer increases the risk, especially if the relative was diagnosed at a young age. BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutations Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes significantly increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers. Personal History of Breast Cancer Women who have previously been diagnosed with breast cancer have a higher risk of developing a second breast cancer. Early Menarche Starting menstruation at an early age (before 12 years) is associated with a slightly increased risk of breast cancer. Late Menopause Women who experience menopause at a later age (after 55 years) have a higher risk of breast cancer. Nulliparity Never having given birth to a child increases the risk of breast cancer Late Age at First Full-Term Pregnancy Women who have their first full-term pregnancy after the age of 30 have a slightly higher risk of breast cancer. Hormone Replacement Therapy Long-term use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) containing estrogen and progesterone is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Alcohol Consumption Regular and excessive alcohol consumption is a known risk factor for breast cancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Early menarche: Women who start menstruating at a younger age have a longer lifetime exposure to estrogen and other hormones, which may contribute to an increased risk of breast cancer. Option: B. Estrogen exposure: Prolonged exposure to estrogen, whether through hormone replacement therapy, use of oral contraceptives, or estrogen-related conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Option: C. Nullipara: Women who have not had children have a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer compared to those who have had children, especially if they have not breastfed.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Protective factors that lower the risk of breast cancer Breastfeeding Physical activity Normal BMI Regular screening</p>\n<p></p>",

The tumor cells in lobular carcinoma have a discohesive appearance, meaning they do not adhere tightly to each other, resulting in a scattered pattern.

High mitotic rate: Exhibits a high mitotic rate, with many dividing cells observed under the microscope. Lymphocytic infiltrate: One of the hallmark features of medullary carcinoma is the presence of a prominent lymphocytic infiltrate surrounding and infiltrating the tumor. This infiltrate is composed of lymphocytes and plasma cells and can give the tumor a lymphoid-like appearance.
