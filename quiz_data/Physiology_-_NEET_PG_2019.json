Type I glomus cells (carotid and aortic body) have O2-sensitive K+ channels, whose conductance is reduced in proportion to the degree of hypoxia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Peripheral chemoreceptors are specialized sensory cells located in the carotid bodies and aortic bodies, which are small clusters of cells near the carotid artery in the neck and the aorta in the chest. These chemoreceptors are responsible for detecting changes in the levels of oxygen (hypoxia) and carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) in the blood. Carotid bodies are composed of glomus cells (also called type I), which are of neuronal phenotype and contain a variety of neurotransmitters. Glomus cells are in functional contact with the afferent nerve endings. Glomus cells are initial site(s) of sensory transduction. Hypoxia releases transmitter(s) from glomus cells, which in turn by depolarizing the sensory nerve ending leads to an increase in sensory discharge. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter in peripheral chemoreceptors (carotid body and aortic bodies) Afferent from carotid bodies passes from glossopharyngeal nerve. One hypothesis assumes that a K+-channel protein is an O2 sensor and that hypoxia depolarizes glomus cells by inhibiting the K+ channel, leading to an increase in cytosolic Ca2+.The increased calcium ions stimulate release of a neurotransmitter that activates afferent neurons that send signals to the central nervous system and stimulate respiration. The major function of these carotid and aortic bodies is to sense hypoxia in the arterial blood and send signals to the medulla to increase ventilation The signals are carried through afferents of vagus for aortic bodies and glossopharyngeal nerve for carotid bodies The glomus cell is the chemo sensor in the carotid and aortic bodies</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option:  A. Calcium channel: Calcium channels are involved in various cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, and intracellular signaling. While calcium ions play a role in some aspects of chemoreceptor function and neurotransmitter release, they are not directly involved in the initial response to hypoxia in peripheral chemoreceptors. Option:  B. Sodium channel: Sodium channels are responsible for the movement of sodium ions across cell membranes and play a vital role in action potential generation and propagation in excitable cells, such as neurons. While sodium ions are involved in neuronal signaling, they are not the primary channel responsible for the initial response to hypoxia in peripheral chemoreceptors. Option:  D. Chloride channel: Chloride channels are membrane proteins that allow the movement of chloride ions across cell membranes. While chloride ions are important for various physiological functions, they are not the primary channel involved in the response to hypoxia in peripheral chemoreceptors.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is a sensory receptor located within the tendons of skeletal muscles near their insertion points into bones.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>When the muscle contracts and generates tension, the GTO senses this tension and sends signals to the nervous system. These signals help regulate muscle tension by causing a reflex relaxation of the muscle, which is important for preventing excessive force on the tendons and potential damage to the muscle-tendon unit.

Length: Muscle length is primarily monitored by muscle spindle fibers, not Golgi tendon organs. Muscle spindles are sensory receptors located within the muscle fibers that detect changes in muscle length and play a crucial role in the stretch reflex and proprioception. Option: C. Pressure: Golgi tendon organs do not sense pressure. They are specifically designed to detect changes in muscle tension or force. Pressure sensing is usually done by other types of sensory receptors, such as mechanoreceptors found in the skin and deep tissues. Option: D. Proprioception: While Golgi tendon organs are involved in proprioception, they are not the primary receptors responsible for it. Proprioception is the sense of knowing where our body is in space and is crucial for coordinating movement and maintaining balance. Muscle spindles, as mentioned earlier, are the main proprioceptive receptors responsible for detecting changes in muscle length and providing feedback to the nervous system about limb position and movement. Golgi tendon organs primarily provide feedback about muscle tension, which is also essential for proprioception but is not the sole mechanism for it.</p>\n<p></p>",

In obstructive lung diseases, the airways are narrowed, making it difficult for the person to exhale air effectively, leading to decreased FEV1/FVC ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is: B. Obstructive Lung disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>FEV1/FVC = 1.5/3.5 = 42% (significantly reduced). A healthy FVC is ~4.0 L and a healthy FEV1 is ~3.3 L. The calculated FEV 1/FVC is ~80%. Patients with obstructive or restrictive diseases can display reduced FVC. Measurement of FEV1, however, tends to vary significantly between the two diseases. In obstructive disorders, patients tend to show a slow, steady slope to the FVC, resulting in a small FEV1. However, in the restrictive disorder, patient\u2019s airflow tends to be fast at first, and then quickly level out to approach FVC. The resultant FEV1 is much greater, even though FVC is equivalent (compare B, C below) Obstructive disorders result in a marked decrease in both FVC and FEV1/FVC, whereas restrictive disorders result in a loss of FVC without loss in FEV1/FVC.

Restrictive disease: Restrictive lung diseases are characterized by a reduced lung volume and decreased lung compliance, making it difficult for the lungs to expand fully. This results in a decrease in both the FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) and the FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second). Option: C. Mixed obstructive restrictive disorder: This option suggests a combination of both obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. While it's possible for individuals to have overlapping features of both types of lung diseases, the given FEV1/FVC ratio (\u2248 0.43) is indicative of an obstructive pattern. In a mixed disorder, one would typically expect abnormalities in both FEV1 and FVC with a decreased ratio, but here, the reduced ratio points specifically to an obstructive lung disease. Option: D. Interstitial lung disease: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a group of disorders that affect the interstitium of the lungs (the tissue and space around the air sacs). ILD may result in restrictive lung function patterns with reduced FVC. However, it is not possible to determine the presence of ILD solely based on the FEV1/FVC ratio.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Carbon dioxide Respiratory centers, specifically the central chemoreceptors in the medulla oblongata, are primarily stimulated by changes in the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The body\u2019s respiratory center in the medulla is normally stimulated by an increased concentration of carbon dioxide, and to a lesser extent, by decreased levels of oxygen in arterial blood. Stimulation of the respiratory center causes an increase in the rate and depth of breathing, thus blowing off excess carbon dioxide and reducing blood acidity. An increase in blood CO2 levels, which leads to a decrease in blood pH (acidity), triggers the central chemoreceptors to increase the rate and depth of breathing. This process helps to eliminate excess carbon dioxide and restore the blood's pH balance.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Oxygen levels (A. Oxygen) also play a role in respiratory regulation, they primarily influence the peripheral chemoreceptors located in the carotid bodies and aortic bodies, which respond to changes in arterial oxygen levels. Option: B & D .Lactic acid and calcium are not direct stimulants of the respiratory centers. Lactic acid is produced during anaerobic metabolism and exercise but does not have a direct effect on respiratory regulation. Calcium is involved in various physiological processes but does not play a significant role in the regulation of the respiratory centers.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>It is characterized by flexion of upper limbs and extension of lower limbs Removal of the cerebral cortex (decortication) produces decorticate rigidity. Characterized by flexion of the upper extremities at the elbow and extensor hyperactivity in the lower extremities. The flexion can be explained by active rubrospinal excitation of flexor muscles in the upper extremities; the hyperextension of lower extremities is due to the same changes that occur after midcollicular decerebration.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Decorticate Rigidity Removal of cerebral cortex Corticospinal tract is cut off Intact Rubrospinal tract (which causes flexion of upper limbs) Intact reticulospinal tract (which causes extension of limbs) So the net effect is that there is flexion of upper limbs and extension of lower limbs This type of rigidity is seen on the hemiplegic side after hemorrhages or thrombosis in the internal capsule. Decerebrate Rigidity Complete transection of brainstem between superior and inferior colliculi (mid collicular cerebration) Corticospinal tract is cut off Rubrospinal tract is cut off Intact reticulospinal tract (which causes extension of upper and lower limbs- due to its excitatory effect of gamma motor neurons, which indirectly activates the alpha motor neurons) So the net effect is that there is extension of both upper and lower limbs This type of rigidity can occur after uncal herniation</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. is incorrect because decorticate rigidity is caused by damage to the cerebral cortex, but the basal ganglia is not directly involved in its development. Option: B. is incorrect because, in decorticate rigidity, the opposite pattern is seen: flexion of the upper limbs and extension of the lower limbs. Option: C. is incorrect because rigidity, in this context, refers to increased muscle tone and resistance to passive movement. While rigidity is present in decorticate rigidity, it is not necessarily more pronounced than other types of rigidity.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Abnormal motor posturing</p>\n<p></p>",
