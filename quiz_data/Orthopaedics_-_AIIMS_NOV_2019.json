So serum PTH levels would confirm the diagnosis. Histopathologically, both chondroblastoma and langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) have cells with grooved nuclei with eosinophilic cytoplasm. Therefore, to distinguish between them the next step Would be to obtain a CD1a marker which would be positive in LCH. The specific markers for LCH are CD1a langerin (CD207). MRI can be done in the case of chondroblastoma, but it should precede biopsy. Thus, the best option in this case  would be to obtain a CD1a marker.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>SKELETAL AND RDIOLOGICAL MANIFESTATION OF LANGERHAN\u2019S CELL HISTIOCYTOSIS Skull: Solitary or multiple punched out lytic lesion without sclerotic rim.
