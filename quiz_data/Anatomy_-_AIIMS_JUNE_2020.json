They drain into the upper deep cervical group of lymph nodes. Any malignancy in this area has a tendency for nodal metastasis. Foreign bodies in the throat commonly gets lodged here. Since the superior laryngeal nerve lies superficially in this area, it can be topically blocked by placing cotton pledgets soaked in 4% Xylocaine in this area. This is known as the pyriform fossa block. Tumors involving the pyriform fossa commonly arise from its deep portion. This may escape detection during an Indirect Laryngoscopy examination. But if one looks for pooling of saliva in the involved pyriform fossa the underlying growth can be suspected. Hence pooling of saliva is an important clinical sign indicating an underlying tumor in the deep portion of the pyriform fossa, or the presence of a foreign body can also be suspected by this sign. Causes for pooling of saliva in the pyriform fossa: Pooling of saliva in the pyriform fossa is not only caused by growth affecting this area causing obstruction to saliva being swallowed, but also due to intense cricopharyngeal muscle spasm. Malignant growth involving the deep portion of the pyriform fossa Foreign body being lodged in the pyriform fossa.

Transitional epithelium</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The epithelium appears to be 4\u20136 cells thick and lines organs that undergo considerable distension and contraction. It can therefore stretch greatly without losing its integrity. In stretching, the cells become flattened without altering their positions relative to each other, because they are firmly connected by numerous However, the urothelium appears to be reduced to only 2\u20133 cells thick. The epithelium is called transitional because of the apparent transition from a stratified cuboidal epithelium to a stratified squamous epithelium, which occurs as it is stretched to accommodate urine, particularly in the bladder. The basal cells are basophilic and contain many ribosomes; they are uninucleate (diploid), and cuboidal when relaxed. More apically, they form large binucleate or, more often, Polyploid uninucleate cells. The surface cells are the largest and may even be octoploid; in the relaxed state they typically bulge into the lumen as dome-shaped cells with a thickened, eosinophilic glycocalyx or cell coat. Their luminal surfaces are covered by a specialized plasma membrane in which plaques of intramembranous glycoprotein particles are embedded to stiffen the membrane. When the epithelium is relaxed, the surface area of the cells is reduced and the plaques are partially internalized by the hinge-like action of the more flexible interplaque membrane regions. The plaques re-emerge on to the surface when it is stretched.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Ureter Renal pelvis Minor calyx The urothelium starts from the ends of the collecting ducts and continues into the minor calyces, then the major calyces, then the renal pelvis, then the ureter and finally ends at the prostatic urethra, THEREFORE Option A,B and C are incorrect answers.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The urothelium starts from the ends of the collecting ducts and continues into the minor calyces, then the major calyces, then the renal pelvis, then the ureter and finally ends at the prostatic urethra.</p>\n<p></p>",
