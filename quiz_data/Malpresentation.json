Before labour or early in labour, with the membranes intact, attempts at an external version are worth trying in the absence of other complications that indicate cesarean section. When a patient with a transverse lie is seen in labour, it is managed as follows: Early labour: ECV \u2013 provided there is a good amount of liquor amnii and there is no contraindication. ECV should be tried in all cases. LSCS \u2013 is the preferred method of delivery, if the version fails or is contraindicated. Late labour: Baby alive \u2013 If the baby is mature and the fetal condition is good , it is preferable to do LSCS in all cases. Baby dead \u2013 LSCS. The internal version should not be done. In transverse lie \u2013 the presentation is shoulder presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>M/C cause of transverse lie is prematurity. M/C cause of transverse lie in term pregnancy \u2013 placenta previa. There is no mechanism of labour in transverse lie. M/C cause of cord prolapse is a transverse lie. Hand prolapse occurs in transverse lie. Management of transverse lie with live baby in labour \u2013 caesarean section. Management of transverse lie with dead baby \u2013 caesarean section. Management of neglected shoulder presentation \u2013 caesarean section. Management of transverse lie during pregnancy \u2013 external cephalic version. Management of 1st twins with a transverse lie \u2013 caesarean section. Management of 2nd twin with a transverse lie \u2013 Internal Podalic Version.</p>\n<p></p>",

There is a complete extension of the head so that the occiput is in contact with the back. The denominator is mentum. The commonest position is left mentoanterior (LMA). Face presentation present during pregnancy (primary) is rare, while that developing after the onset of labour (secondary) is common. It occurs more frequently seen in multiparae (70%), like other malpresentation. The most common maternal cause is platypelloid pelvis and the most common fetal cause is anencephaly. The diameter of engagement is the oblique diameter \u2014right in LMA, left in RMA. The engaging diameter of the head is submento-bregmatic 9.5 cm in the fully extended head or submentovertical 11.5 cm in the partially extended head. Engagement is delayed because of the long distance between the mentum and biparietal plane (7 cm). The head is born by flexion: (11.5 cm). Vaginal delivery is possible in mentoanterior positions but not in persistent mentoposterior. In mentoposterior during the early stages of labour, the policy of wait and watch should be adopted, in the hope of mentoposterior getting converted to mentoanterior spontaneously. Persistent mentoposterior position is an indication for doing a cesarean section.</p>\n<p></p>",

Ultrasound examination is done to confirm the diagnosis and adequacy of amniotic fluid volume. A reactive NST should precede the maneuver. Then ECV is attempted followed by a repeat NST after the procedure. There may be undue bradycardia due to head compression which is expected to settle down by 10 minutes. If however, fetal bradycardia persists , the possibility of cord entanglement should be kept in mind and in such cases, reversion is done. If the version is successful the patient is observed for 30 minutes: To allow for the fetal heart rate to settle down to normal.
