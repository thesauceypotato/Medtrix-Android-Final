The risk of mortality for both mother and fetus is high if SAA ruptures during pregnancy, and hence, surgical intervention is essential. Indications for surgical treatment of SAA in pregnancy include the presence of symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever, intention to become pregnant, and pseudoaneurysms associated with inflammatory processes. Surgery during pregnancy is challenging and requires a multidisciplinary approach involving obstetricians, vascular surgeons, and anesthesiologists. Open surgery and endovascular techniques can be used for treating SAA during pregnancy. The choice of surgical technique depends on the size, location, and type of aneurysm . Open surgery involves laparotomy or splenectomy, and it is associated with a higher risk of complications, longer hospital stays, and recovery time. Endovascular techniques include coil embolization, stent grafting, and balloon occlusion. These procedures are less invasive and have a shorter recovery time but are associated with a higher risk of recurrence. The timing of surgery depends on the gestational age, stability of the mother and fetus, and the urgency of the surgical intervention. Surgery is usually performed in the second trimester when the risk to the fetus is relatively low.

Splenectomy is recommended for severe grades of injury where controlling bleeding takes priority over attempts to salvage the spleen. Splenic angiography with embolization may be an alternative to splenectomy, but should not delay surgery in a hemodynamically unstable patient. Rupture of an enlarged spleen due to malaria is not uncommon in tropical countries and may present with delayed symptoms following a minor injury. Radiological embolization may be performed in such cases if available, but splenectomy should be considered before a peri splenic hematoma ruptures.

Splenic hemangiomas are vascular tumors that arise from blood vessels in the spleen. Most splenic hemangiomas are small and asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally during imaging studies. In rare cases, splenic hemangiomas can cause abdominal pain or discomfort. Treatment of splenic hemangiomas may require surgical removal of the spleen.

Haemangioma is the most common benign tumor of the spleen and may rarely develop into a hemangiosarcoma that is managed by splenectomy. Angiosarcomas (or hemangiosarcomas) of the spleen usually occur spontaneously but have been linked to environmental exposures, such as thorium dioxide and monomeric vinyl chloride. Option: D . Lymphangiomas are endothelium-lined cysts and are usually benign tumors; however, lymphangiosarcoma has been found within lymphangiomas.</p>\n<p></p>",
