The pain worsened with bending forward or reaching out. The patient had a history of a congenital back condition and a previous lumbar vertebra fracture due to an accident. An MRI conducted two months earlier showed L1 degeneration, disc degeneration, and disc protrusion at the S1 level. Despite being prescribed strong non-steroidal pain medication, the pain relief was insufficient, and the medication caused drowsiness. The patient sought alternative treatment with InterX therapy, which targeted the entire lumbar-sacral zone, dermatomes L1/L2, L4, L5, S1\u2013S3, and the left and right buttocks, as well as the left back of the knee. After two and a half weeks of therapy, the patient reported complete pain relief, discontinued pain medication, and began core exercises to stabilize the lumbar spine. The patient was advised to limit driving, prolonged sitting, rest, follow a good diet, and perform gentle stretching exercises. A six-month follow-up confirmed that the patient remained pain-free, was actively working, and traveling. All of the following anatomical statements are true about this case except?",
