Complete failure of conduction from the atrium to the ventricle is referred to as \u2018\u2019complete or third-degree\u2019\u2019 AV block.</p>\n<p></p>",

T emporary or permanent artificial pacing is the most reliable treatment for patients with symptomatic AV conduction system disease. Option: B. Pharmacotherapy with isoproterenol or atropine may be useful if the block is in the AV node. Option: C. Patients who have asymptomatic second-degree AV block of either type should be considered for pacing if the block is demonstrated to be intra- or infra-His or is associated with a wide QRS complex.</p>\n<p></p>",
