      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Decrease in activation energy For a substrate to become a product, it goes to a transition state (S\u2021) which is a fleeting, momentary, unstable chemical species that is neither substrate nor product. This species has the highest free energy in a reaction coordinate diagram. This creates an energy barrier for a substrate to become a product. This energy is known as activation energy. So, activation energy is the free energy difference between substrates and that of their transition state Gibb\u2019s Free Energy graph for enzyme- catalyzed and enzyme uncatalyzed reaction. On X-axis, reaction progress is taken (i.e. S getting converted to P). For any spontaneous reaction, S has more free energy as compared to P. For S to be converted to P, first S has to acquire activation energy and reach a high energy state (transition state). Only then it can be converted to P. The enzyme acts by decreasing the free energy of the transition state intermediate by its stabilization, so that activation energy also decreases.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Options A and C: Extremes of temperature and pH will result in enzyme denaturation and loss of activity. Option D: Enzyme activity increases with the increase in substrate concentration. So, a low substrate concentration will result in low enzyme activity.</p>\n<p></p>",

They greatly increase the rate of reactions as the product of one enzyme serves as a reactant for the next enzyme in the complex.

Different enzymes here mean that their amino acid sequences are different from one another (option b is correct). Option C: Allosteric regulators do not bind to the active site of the enzyme Allosteric regulators bind to a site other than the active site. This site is known as an allosteric or regulatory site (option c is correct). Regulator binding to the allosteric site causes a conformation change in the substrate which in turn help in increasing or decreasing the catalysis and rate of reaction. Option D: Translational regulation is the method of long-term regulation of enzymatic activity Translational regulation means inhibiting/activating the synthesis of enzyme/protein (protein translation) to stop/increase the reaction. It takes time and hence is a long-term regulation method (option d is also correct). On the other hand, allosteric regulation works instantaneously.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Increasing activation energy Enzymes increase the rate of reaction by decreasing the activation energy (Option C is false). It does so by lowering the free energy of the transition state, so that the transition state will be reached faster compared to a non-catalyzed reaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option A: Forming non-covalent interactions Mostly in enzyme-substrate (ES) interactions, non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen, hydrophobic & ionic bonds are formed. Vander Waal forces are never seen between enzyme and substrate. These interactions will help stabilize the transition state and also help in inter or intramolecular transfer of electrons, atoms, or a functional group within or between substrate molecules. Option B: Forming acid-base interactions Enzymes can also facilitate the reaction by donating or accepting the proton from its active site acidic or basic amino acid residues. This is known as acid-base catalysis. The amino acid residue most used for this type of reaction is Histidine as it can act as both acid and base due to pKa close to 7.0. Examples of such enzymes are Chymotrypsin which uses a histidine residue as a base catalyst to increase the nucleophilic property of serine, and carbonic anhydrase which also uses histidine to remove hydrogen ions from water molecules to generate OH. Option D: Forming covalent interactions Some enzymes also perform catalysis by forming a covalent reaction intermediate with its substrate. Examples of such enzymes include PLP-dependent transaminases and TPP-dependent PDH complexes. These cofactors are generally involved in the covalent interactions and help to reduce the energy of transition states.</p>\n<p></p>",

Heat stability: One of the isoenzymes may be easily denatured by heat, e.g. bone isoenzyme of ALP (BALP) while other liver ALP is much more heat stable (Option B is true) Inhibitors: One of the isoenzymes may be sensitive to one inhibitor, e.g. tartrate labile ACP (ACP-1, 2, 3 and 6) vs Tartrate resistant ACP (TRAP) ACP-5 K m value or substrate specificity may be different for isoenzymes, e.g. glucokinase has high K m and hexokinase has low K m for glucose. Glucokinase specifically acts on glucose as a substrate while hexokinase can phosphorylate any hexose sugar (Option C is true) . Co-factor requirements can be different for isoenzymes, for example, the cytoplasmic isoenzyme of isocitrate dehydrogenase is NADP + dependent whereas Mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase is NAD + dependent. Tissue localization may be different for isoenzymes. The H4 form of LDH is present in the heart, while the M4 variety is present in skeletal muscle. Specific antibodies may identify different types of isoenzymes. For example, CK isoenzymes are separated by different antibodies.</p>\n<p></p>",
