Extranodal tumours were initially recognized at mucosal sites and are often referred to as mucosa-associated lymphoid tumours (or MALTomas) . In most cases, the tumour cells show evidence of somatic hypermutation and are considered to be of memory B-cell origin . It has three exceptional characteristics. They often arise within tissues involved by chronic inflammatory disorders of autoimmune or infectious etiology ; examples include the salivary gland in Sj\u00f6gren disease, the thyroid gland in Hashimoto thyroiditis, and the stomach in Helicobacter gastritis. They remain localized for prolonged periods , spreading systemically only late in their course. They may regress if the inciting agent (e.g., H. pylori) is eradicated . MALT lymphomas express B-cell antigens (CD19 and CD20) & monotypic surface Ig (IgM without IgD).

Follicular lymphomas are low-grade and indolent.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL): A Most common type of Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma ( NHLs ) in the world and India . Has the worst prognosis among NHLs . CD 19 +ve, CD 20 +ve, mostly surface IgM +ve and variable CD 6 and CD 10 positive. Cytogenetics: BCL6 translocation, t(14;18), MYC. Microscopy: The common features are a relatively large cell size (usually four to five times the diameter of a small lymphocyte) and a diffuse pattern of growth . More anaplastic tumours may contain multinucleated cells with large inclusion-like nucleoli that resemble Reed-Sternberg cells (the malignant cell of Hodgkin lymphoma). Clinical features: DLBCL typically presents as a rapidly enlarging mass at a nodal or extranodal site. It can arise virtually anywhere in the body. Waldeyer ring, the oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue that includes the tonsils and adenoids, is involved commonly. DLBCLs are aggressive tumours that are rapidly fatal without treatment . DLBCLs with MYC translocations have a worse prognosis than those without and may be better treated with chemotherapy regimens that are now standard for Burkitt lymphoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B.
