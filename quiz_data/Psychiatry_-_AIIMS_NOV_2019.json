      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Administration of long acting depot anti psychotics Z track technique is used for giving I.M. injections of long acting depot antipsychotics. In this technique, the skin and tissue are pulled and held firmly while injection is given; and after removing the needle, skin and tissue are released. This prevents leakage of the medication into the subcutaneous tissue as the track that needle forms is zig- zag and drug can\u2019t come out.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Long-acting depot antipsychotics are used for the maintenance treatment of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, to provide sustained release of the medication over an extended period. The Z track technique is used to ensure accurate administration of long-acting depot antipsychotics and prevent leakage of the medication.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Case 1- A, Case 2- D Case 1 features: High blood pressure (BP), tachycardia, tremors: These are characteristic of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Auditory and visual hallucinations: Hallucinations can occur during alcohol withdrawal. Hepatomegaly: Enlarged liver can be seen in chronic alcohol use. Disorientation: Disorientation to time, place, and person can be present in alcohol withdrawal. Case 2 features: Yawning, diarrhea, diaphoresis: These are common opioid withdrawal symptoms. Mydriasis (pupillary dilation): Pupil dilation can occur during opioid withdrawal. High fever (104\u00b0F): High fever is not typically associated with opioid withdrawal, but it may be present due to other factors. Rhinorrhea (runny nose), piloerection (goosebumps): These are additional signs of opioid withdrawal. Therefore, the most likely withdrawal features for Case 1 are related to alcohol withdrawal (Option A), and for Case 2, they are related to opioid withdrawal (Option D).</p>\n<p></p>",

It is characterized by altered mental status (global confusion) and sympathetic overdrive (autonomic hyperactivity), which can progress to cardiovascular collapse. Acute infection can act as a trigger for delirium tremens in individuals with a history of alcoholism.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Small consumption of alcohol: Delirium tremens is not caused by small consumption of alcohol. It is associated with chronic alcoholism and severe withdrawal. Option B. Gradual withdrawal from alcohol: Gradual withdrawal from alcohol does not cause delirium tremens. However, sudden withdrawal can trigger its onset. Option C. Fatty liver: While fatty liver is a common complication of chronic alcoholism, it is not the direct cause of delirium tremens.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Delirium tremens requires medical intervention due to its potential life-threatening complications. Treatment of delirium tremens includes benzodiazepines to control symptoms and prevent seizures.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Observe patient for 2 hours after meal In a young girl with anorexia nervosa who has been following the recommended diet plan and not gaining weight, the next step in management is to observe the patient for 2 hours after meals. This is because the lack of weight gain despite adequate food intake suggests the possibility of purging behavior, such as self-induced vomiting. By observing the patient for 2 hours after meals, healthcare providers can ensure that there is no purging occurring, which may be hindering weight gain.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by a fear of weight gain, distorted body image, and restriction of food intake leading to severe weight loss. Purging behaviors, such as self-induced vomiting or misuse of laxatives, are common in individuals with anorexia nervosa.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Increase fluid intake: Increasing fluid intake may not directly address the issue of weight gain in this scenario, as it is more likely related to purging behavior rather than fluid imbalance. Option C. Increase the dose of anxiolytics: Anxiolytics are used to manage anxiety symptoms and may not directly impact weight gain. The lack of weight gain in this case suggests a different issue that needs to be addressed. Option D. Increase the caloric intake from 1500 kcal to 2000 kcal per day: Increasing caloric intake may not be the appropriate step at this point, as the issue lies in purging behavior rather than inadequate caloric intake.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Other signs and symptoms of anorexia nervosa include excessive exercise, preoccupation with food and weight, amenorrhea (in females), and cold intolerance. Multidisciplinary treatment involving a team of healthcare professionals, including psychiatrists, nutritionists, and therapists, is crucial for managing anorexia nervosa. Psychological interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and family-based therapy (FBT) are commonly used in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.</p>\n<p></p>",
