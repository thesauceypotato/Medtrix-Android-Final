Diabetes mellitus is not associated with BSK.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Calcific Degeneration (Band Shaped Keratopathy) Band shaped keratopathy (BSK) is essentially a degenerative change associated with the deposition of calcium salts in Bowman's membrane, the most superficial part of the stroma and in deeper layers of the epithelium. Etiology Idiopathic or primary BSK is familial . Age-related BSK is common and affects otherwise healthy cornea. Chronic ocular diseases (most common cause) complicated by band keratopathy include chronic uveitis in adults, children with Still's disease, phthisis bulbi, chronic glaucoma, chronic keratitis, and ocular trauma. Conditions associated with hypercalcaemia, such as hypercalcaemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, chronic renal failure, and sarcoidosis, may also be the cause of BSK. Clinical features typically present as a band-shaped opacity in the interpalpebral zone with a clear interval between the ends of the band and the limbus. The condition begins at the periphery and gradually progresses towards the centre. The opacity is beneath the epithelium, which usually remains intact. Treatment Chelation, i.e.the chemical removal of deposited calcium salts, is an effective treatment. First of all, corneal epithelium is scraped under local anaesthesia. Then a 01-molar solution of EDTA (chelating agent) is applied to the denuded cornea with the help of a cotton swab for about 10 minutes. This removes most of the deposited calcium. A pad and bandage is then applied for 2-3 days to allow the epithelium to regenerate. Photo therapeutic keratectomy (PTK) with an excimer laser is very effective in clearing the cornea. Keratoplasty may be performed when the band keratopathy is obscuring useful vision . treatment of the underlying causative disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

Recently, it was reported that an amniotic membrane matrix can suppress transforming growth factor-\u03b2 ( TGF-\u03b2 ) signaling and the proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation of normal human corneal and limbal fibroblasts. This action helps explain why amniotic membrane transplantation reduces corneal haze after phototherapeutic or photorefractive keratectomy in rabbits . We have also used the amniotic membrane in the treatment of other corneal diseases with epithelial defects. Amniotic membrane application showed many promising effects on promoting corneal epithelial healing, maintaining clarity, and resulting in a lower recurrence after the removal of the pterygium.</p>\n<p></p>",

Symptoms: extreme burning pain, lacrimation, photophobia, blepharospasm and swelling of the palpebral conjunctiva and retrotarsal folds. Signs: It is due to desquamation of the epithelium, leading to multiple erosions. There is a latent period of 4 or 5 hours between exposure and the onset of symptoms. The condition is generally caused by the bright flash of a short circuit or exposure to a naked arclight, as in industrial welding or cinema studios. It is rarely due to exposure to enclosed arc lights since the glass globe absorbs the most deleterious rays . In snow blindness, the cause and symptoms are similar, because the ultraviolet rays are reflected from snow surfaces . Prophylaxis consists of wearing dark glasses, when such exposure is anticipated, made particularly of materials such as Crookes glass, which cuts off nearly all the infrared and ultraviolet rays.

The principle of keratometry is that the anterior corneal surface behaves as a convex mirror, and the size of the image changes with the curvature. There are various clinical uses of keratometers, such as corneal astigmatism measurement, contact lens fitting, There are two types of keratometers: single position Helmholtz keratometers , which are more common, and can adjust image size; and Javal-Schiotz keratometer , which are two-position machines that adjust object size.

Superficial vascularization, in which vessels are arranged in an arborising pattern, is present below epithelial layer, and their continuity can be traced with conjunctival vessels. Superficial vascularization is caused by trachoma, phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis, rosacea keratitis, superficial corneal ulcers. Deep vascularization is derived from anterior ciliary arteries and lies in corneal stroma. These vessels are straight, not anastomosing, and their continuity can\u2019t be traced beyond limbus.
