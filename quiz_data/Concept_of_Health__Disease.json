It also reflects the causes of current illnesses and conditions.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Web causation of disease The model of web causation of disease was suggested by McMahon and Pugh. The \u201cweb of causation\u201d considers all the predisposing factors of any type and their complex interrelationship with each other. The basic tenet of epidemiology is to study the clusters of causes and combination of effects and how they are related to each other. The web of causation model is ideally suited in the study of chronic diseases (eg. myocardial infarction) where the disease agent is often not known, but is the outcome of interaction of multiple factors</p>\n<p></p>",
