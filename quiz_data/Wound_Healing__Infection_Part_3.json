This scenario typically occurs 5 to 8 days following surgery when the strength of the wound is at its weakest Feature : It may herald an underlying abscess and usually presents with a serosanguinous discharge Popping sensation during straining or coughing Risk Factors General Malnourishment Diabetes Obesity Renal failure Jaundice Sepsis Cancer Treatment with steroids Emergency surgery Local Inadequate or poor closure of wound or closure of a wound under tension Poor local wound healing, e.g. because of infection, hematoma or seroma Increased intra-abdominal pressure, e.g. in postoperative patients with chronic obstructive airway disease, during excessive coughing Management : Most patients with full-thickness dehiscence of an abdominal wound will need to return to the operating theater for resuturing. In patients in whom tissues are suspected to be infected, of poor quality, or under excessive tension , it may be appropriate to leave the wound open and treat it with dressings or vacuum-assisted closure pumps .</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Wound infection POST-OPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS: Wound infection: Wound infection is the most common postoperative complication, occurring in 5\u201310% of all patients. This usually presents with pain and erythema of the wound on the fourth or fifth postoperative day, often soon after hospital discharge. Treatment is by wound drainage and antibiotics when required. The organisms responsible are usually a mixture of gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic bacteria, predominantly Bacteroides species and anaerobic streptococci. Intra-abdominal abscess: Approximately 8% of patients following appendectomy will develop a postoperative intra-abdominal abscess. Ileus Respiratory disease Venous thrombosis and embolism Portal Pyaemia (Pylephlebitis) Fecal fistula Adhesive intestinal obstruction</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The infection of a wound can be defined as the invasion of organisms into tissues following a breakdown of local and systemic host defenses, leading to either cellulitis, lymphangitis, abscess formation, or bacteremia. Types : Endogenous: Present in or on the host , e.g. SSSI following contamination of the wound from a perforated appendix Exogenous: Acquired from a source outside the body, such as the operating theater (inadequate air filtration, poor antisepsis) or the ward (e.g. poor handwashing compliance). The cause of hospital-acquired infection (HAI) In modern hospital practice, endogenous organisms colonizing the patient are by far the most common source of infection. Based on Pus Discharge Criteria : A significant quantity of pus Delayed return home Patients are systemically ill Major SSI : A wound that either discharges significant quantities of pus spontaneously or needs a secondary procedure to drain it. The patient may have systemic signs such as tachycardia, pyrexia, and a raised white cell count Minor SSI Wound infections may discharge pus or infected serous fluid but are not associated with excessive discomfort, systemic signs, or delay in return home Risk Factors : Malnutrition (obesity, weight loss) Metabolic disease (diabetes, uremia, jaundice) Immunosuppression (cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS], steroids, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) Colonization and translocation in the gastrointestinal tract Poor perfusion (systemic shock or local ischemia) Foreign body material Poor surgical technique (devitalized tissue, dead space, hematoma) Decisive Period : There is up to a 4-hour interval before bacterial growth becomes established enough to cause an infection after a breach in the tissues, whether caused by trauma or by surgery and this interval is called the \u2018decisive period\u2019 Strategies aimed at preventing infection from taking hold become ineffective after this period . It is therefore logical that prophylactic antibiotics should be given to cover this period</p>\n<p></p>",

This encourages platelets to adhere, activate and aggregate, resulting in a platelet plug, which also helps limit further blood loss. Inflammation : In the early inflammatory phase (days 1\u20132) , platelet activation causes an influx of inflammatory cells led by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, particularly neutrophils . During the late inflammatory phase (days 2\u20133) monocytes appear in the wound and differentiate into macrophages Proliferation : The proliferative phase starts around day 3 and lasts for 2\u20134 weeks . It consists mainly of fibroblast activity with the production of ground substance (glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans), collagen, angiogenesis, and re-epithelialization of the wound . The wound tissue formed in the early part of this phase is called granulation tissue . In the later part of this phase, there is an increase in the tensile strength of the wound as a result of increased collagen synthesized by fibroblasts . These play an important role in contraction to bring the edges of the wound together Remodelling : Begins 2\u20133 weeks after injury and lasts for a year or more . This phase is characterized by the maturation of collagen . Type III collagen, which is prevalent during proliferation, is replaced by stronger type I collagen until the normal skin ratio of 4:1 type I to type III collagen is re-established Factors Affecting Wound Healing : \u25cf     SITE OF THE WOUND \u25cf STRUCTURES INVOLVED \u25cf MECHANISM OF WOUNDING \u25cb     INCISION \u25cb     CRUSH \u25cb     CRUSH AVULSION \u25cf CONTAMINATION (FOREIGN BODIES/BACTERIAJA \u25cf LOSS OF TISSUE \u25cf OTHER LOCAL FACTORS \u25cb VASCULAR INSUFFICIENCY (ARTERIAL OR VENOUS) \u25cb      PREVIOUS RADIATION \u25cb      PRESSURE \u25cf SYSTEMIC FACTORS \u25cb MALNUTRITION \u25cb         DISEASE (E.G.
