PSGN is most common in children between the ages of 6 and 10, but it can occur at any age. Option: C. It is an immune complex-mediated disease: True. PSGN is an immune complex-mediated disease, in which immune complexes become deposited in the glomeruli, leading to an inflammatory response and damage to the glomeruli. Option: D. Serum complement levels are low: True. In PSGN, serum complement levels (C3 in particular) are typically low, due to the consumption of complement during the immune response to the streptococcal infection.</p>\n<p></p>",
