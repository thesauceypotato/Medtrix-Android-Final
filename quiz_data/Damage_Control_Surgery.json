Patients with the \u2018deadly triad\u2019 (hypothermia, acidosis and coagulopathy) are those at the highest risk. The goal of damage control surgery (DCS) is to control surgical bleeding and limit gastrointestinal (GI) spillage. The operative techniques used are temporary measures, with the definitive repair of injuries delayed until the patient is physiologically replete. The technique has been adopted following major trauma and includes initial care and resuscitation (damage control resuscitation) and the surgical correction of the injury (damage control surgery).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Acidosis: Bleeding causes a host of responses. During the resuscitative phase, the lethal triad (acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy) is frequent in severely bleeding patients, most likely because of two major factors. First, decreased perfusion causes lactic acidosis and consumptive coagulopathy. Second, room temperature and large volume fluids lead to worsening hypothermia and dilutional coagulopathy, creating a resuscitation injury The acidotic state is not necessarily undesirable because the body tolerates acidosis better than alkalosis Hypothermia : Hypothermia can be both beneficial and detrimental. Fundamental knowledge of hypothermia is of vital importance in the care of surgical patients. The beneficial aspects of hypothermia are mainly a result of decreased metabolism. Injury sites are often iced, creating vasoconstriction and decreasing inflammation through decreased metabolism. This concept of cooling to slow metabolism is also the rationale behind using hypothermia to decrease ischemia during cardiac, transplant, pediatric, and neurologic surgery Coagulopathy: Always Multifactorial Causes: Acidosis Hypothermia Decreased clotting factors Consumption (from the innate attempt to stop bleeding) Dilution (from infused fluids devoid of clotting factors) Genetic (haemophilia) Tests available: Prothrombin time Partial thromboplastin time International normalized ratio Thromboelastography (TEG) Rotational Thromboelastometry</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Exploratory laparotomy Repair is required but great care must be taken to examine the stomach fully, as an injury to the front of the stomach can be expected to have an \u2018exit\u2019 wound elsewhere on the organ. Since the patient is hemodynamically unstable, the other options are not considered. If the source of the bleeding is in doubt or FAST/CT results are positive, showing a significant amount of blood in the peritoneal cavity, concurrent intra-abdominal injury cannot be excluded and it is wise to perform an exploratory laparotomy to treat or rule out intra-abdominal bleeding</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Patients who have suffered abdominal trauma can generally be classified into the following categories based on their physiological condition after initial resuscitation: Physiologically \u2018normal \u2019 \u2013 investigation can be completed before treatment is planned; Physiologically \u2018non-compromised\u2019 \u2013 investigation is more limited; it is aimed at establishing whether the patient can be managed nonoperatively, whether angioembolization can be used or whether surgery is required; Physiologically \u2018compromised\u2019 \u2013 investigations need to be suspended as immediate surgical correction of the bleeding is required. Patient Assessment : The patient\u2019s physiology must be assessed constantly; if there is an indication that the patient is still actively bleeding, the source must be identified unless the patient is unstable and requires immediate surgery. Blood loss into the abdomen can be subtle and there may be no clear clinical signs. Blood is not an irritant and does not initially cause any abdominal pain. Distension is subjective, and a drop in blood pressure may be a very late sign in a young fit patient. Examination of compromised patients should take place either in the emergency department or in the operating theatre if the patient is deteriorating rapidly. Laparotomy : Laparotomy is the final step in the pathway to delineate intra-abdominal injury. Occasionally it is difficult to determine the source of bleeding in shocked, multiple-injured patients. If doubt still exists, especially in the presence of other injuries, a laparotomy may still be the safest option. The key is to make a decision, as indecision leads to a delay in definitive control.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. In hemodynamically unstable patients, there is no wait-and-watch policy. Option:B. In hemodynamically unstable patients, Imaging can be done once the patient is stabilized. Option: D .
