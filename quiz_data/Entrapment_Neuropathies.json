Entrapment syndrome of the digital nerves of toes is called Interdigital nerve compression (Morton\u2019s metatarsalgia)</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Interdigital nerve compression (Morton\u2019s metatarsalgia) Morton\u2019s metatarsalgia is a common problem, with neuralgia affecting a single distal metatarsal interspace. It is essentially an entrapment or compression syndrome affecting one of the digital nerves Usually the third (affecting the third and fourth toe). The patient typically complains of pain on walking, with the sensation of walking on a pebble in the shoe, or of the sock being rucked up under the ball of the foot. The pain is worse in tight footwear and often has to be relieved by removing the footwear and massaging the foot. Activities that load the forefoot (running, jumping, dancing) exacerbate the condition Treatment Simple offloading of the metatarsal heads by using a metatarsal dome insole and wider-fitting shoes may help. If symptoms do not improve with these measures, a steroid injection into the interspace. Surgical intervention</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.
