On activation, the vein is sucked into the resector under direct vision, morcellated and removed by suction. The Trivex system uses two components. The first instrument illuminates the varicose veins through the skin using advanced fibre optic technology and the vein resector is then guided next to the vein underneath the skin. The suction draws the vein into the tip of the vein resector while a rotating blade effectively removes the leg vein. With this new varicose vein treatment, large clusters of varicose veins can be accurately removed through a minimal number of small incisions and are far more effective than other forms of varicose vein surgery</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A.

The most widely used method is that of Tessari; this utilises two syringes connected using a three-way tap. Outside of a small number of centres, the efficacy of UGFS is significantly worse than for endothermal ablation, leading to high reintervention rates, and the rates of complications such as phlebitis and pigmentation can be high.</p>\n<p></p>",
