Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a potentially reversible cause of dementia, presenting with gait disturbance, incontinence and cognitive decline. IIH causes headaches and even vision loss in young people; it can be managed with weight loss, acetazolamide, serial lumbar puncture and CSF diversion as a last resort. Treatment: Temporary CSF diversion can be achieved with an EVD(external ventricular drain) In the long term, a shunt, usually connecting the lateral ventricles with the peritoneal cavity in the abdomen (ventriculoperitoneal shunt), is the mainstay of management. Shunt blockage and infection are common complications. In some instances, obstructive hydrocephalus can be managed by endoscopic third ventriculostomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
