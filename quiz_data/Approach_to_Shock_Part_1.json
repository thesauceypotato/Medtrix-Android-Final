He presented with a 6-day history of fever not responding to medications, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, and vomiting. CXR shows b/l lung base opacities. SpO2 = 82%, HR = 109, BP = 89/47. JVP has decreased. The patient was intubated and mechanical ventilation was initiated. He was also started with norepinephrine and vasopressin infusion, to which he responded. Saturation was deteriorating, and serum procalcitonin was found elevated. What could be the most appropriate mechanism to explain the finding?",
