B) Alpha block</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Delta rhythm is characterized by slow wave activity with a frequency range of 0.5-4 Hz and is typically observed during deep sleep (NREM Stage 3). Delta rhythms are not expected to appear during wakeful, focused activity such as engaging in a work task. Thus, the transition from a relaxed, wakeful state with alpha rhythms to delta rhythm during cognitive engagement would be unusual and not indicative of normal brain function during wakefulness.</li><li>\u2022 Option A:</li><li>\u2022 slow wave activity</li><li>\u2022 frequency range</li><li>\u2022 0.5-4 Hz</li><li>\u2022 observed during deep sleep</li><li>\u2022 Option C: Theta rhythm is associated with frequencies ranging from 4-7 Hz and can be observed in light sleep , drowsiness , or in certain meditative states. While theta activity may increase during tasks involving memory or creativity , it is not the primary or expected change when transitioning from a relaxed state to focused attention on a work task, where more active and alert cognitive processing is required.</li><li>\u2022 Option C:</li><li>\u2022 4-7 Hz</li><li>\u2022 light sleep</li><li>\u2022 drowsiness</li><li>\u2022 theta activity</li><li>\u2022 increase during tasks</li><li>\u2022 memory</li><li>\u2022 creativity</li><li>\u2022 Option D: Beta block refers to a reduction in beta activity , but in the context of engaging in a focused task , an increase in beta rhythm (13-30 Hz) is more likely, not a block or reduction. Beta rhythms are associated with active , conscious thought processes and alertness . As such, when an individual engages in a cognitive task, an increase in beta activity would typically be observed , reflecting heightened cognitive engagement and processing.</li><li>\u2022 Option D:</li><li>\u2022 reduction</li><li>\u2022 beta activity</li><li>\u2022 engaging</li><li>\u2022 focused task</li><li>\u2022 increase</li><li>\u2022 beta rhythm</li><li>\u2022 active</li><li>\u2022 conscious thought processes</li><li>\u2022 alertness</li><li>\u2022 increase</li><li>\u2022 beta activity</li><li>\u2022 observed</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 To understand the changes in EEG patterns associated with transitions in mental state , specifically the phenomenon of alpha block that occurs when moving from a relaxed state to active cognitive engagement , which is essential for interpreting EEG data in clinical and research settings.</li><li>\u27a4 mental state</li><li>\u27a4 alpha block</li><li>\u27a4 relaxed state</li><li>\u27a4 active cognitive engagement</li><li>\u27a4 Refer: Ganong\u2019s Review of Medical physiology 25 th edition, pg no: 273</li><li>\u27a4 Refer: Ganong\u2019s Review of Medical physiology 25 th edition, pg no: 273</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

An abnormal plantar reflex, such as a positive Babinski sign , indicates UMN dysfunction . Spasticity, characterized by velocity-dependent increased muscle tone , is also a hallmark of UMN lesions . However, this option omits \" Hyperactive tendon reflexes ,\" which are commonly observed in UMN lesions due to the loss of inhibitory control, making it incomplete.</li><li>\u2022 Option A:</li><li>\u2022 Abnormal plantar reflex</li><li>\u2022 Spasticity</li><li>\u2022 correct</li><li>\u2022 upper motor neuron</li><li>\u2022 positive Babinski sign</li><li>\u2022 UMN dysfunction</li><li>\u2022 velocity-dependent increased muscle tone</li><li>\u2022 UMN lesions</li><li>\u2022 Hyperactive tendon reflexes</li><li>\u2022 Option B: \"Hyperactive tendon reflexes\" and \"Spasticity\" are indeed expected findings in UMN lesions. Hyperreflexia results from the reduced inhibition of reflex arcs , and spasticity is due to the increased muscle tone associated with UMN pathology.

The medullary osmolar gradient refers to the gradual increase in solute concentration ( osmolarity ) from the outer renal medulla to the inner medulla .
