Burn size is generally assessed by the \u201cWallace rule of nines.\u201d In adults, each upper extremity and the head and neck are 9% of the total body surface area (TBSA), the lower extremities and the anterior and posterior trunk are 18% each, and the perineum and genitalia are assumed to be 1% of the TBSA . Another method of estimating more minor burns is equating the area of the patient's open hand (including the palm and the extended fingers) with approximately 1% TBSA and then transposing that measurement visually onto the wound for a determination of its size. This method is crucial in evaluating burns of mixed distribution .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Wallace rule of nine</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Wallace's rule of nines is contributed by Alfred Russel Wallace.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Mafenide acetate The four most common dressings for full-thickness and contaminated wounds are Silver sulphadiazine cream (1%): This gives broad-spectrum prophylaxis against bacterial colonization and is particularly effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Silver nitrate solution (0.5%): Again, this is highly effective as prophylaxis against Pseudomonas colonization but not as active as silver sulphadiazine cream against some of the gram-negative aerobes. The other disadvantage of this solution is that it needs to be changed or the wounds resoaked every 2\u20134 hours . It also produces black staining on all the furniture surrounding the patient. Mafenide acetate cream: This is painful to apply. It is usually used as a 5% topical solution but has been associated with metabolic acidosis. Silver sulphadiazine and cerium nitrate: This is also a useful burn dressing, especially for full-thickness burns. It induces a sterile eschar on the burned skin to reduce some of the cell-mediated immunosuppression that occurs in burns. Cerium nitrate forms a sterile eschar and has also been shown to boost cell-mediated immunity in these patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Subcutaneous injection of a dilute adrenaline (epinephrine ) solution and tourniquet control blood loss during most burn injuries. Adrenaline solution is typically used at a dilution of 1:1,000,000 or 1:500,000 . The tumescence fluid used during the procedure is injected into the burn eschar and donor sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Staged burn excision involves shorter, more frequent surgical theatre trips. The remaining eschar must be managed/bound. Large excisions require an arterial line and central venous access for blood pressure monitoring. The anesthetist must control the acid-base balance, clotting time, and hemoglobin levels. The patient's core temperature should not drop below 36\u00b0C to avoid clotting irregularities.</p>\n<p></p>",

The necrotic area burds the zone of coagulation . This tissue is irreversibly damaged at the time of injury. The area immediately surrounding the necrotic zone has a moderate degree of insult with decreased tissue perfusion. This is termed the zone of stasis and, depending on the wound environment, can either survive or go on to coagulative necrosis. The zone of stasis is associated with vascular damage and vessel leakage. Thromboxane A2 , a potent vasoconstrictor, is present in high concentrations in burn wounds, and the local application of inhibitors improves blood flow and decreases the zone of stasis. Last area is the zone of hyperaemia , which is characterized by vasodilation from inflammation surrounding the burn wound. This region contains the clearly viable tissue from which the healing process begins and is generally not at risk for further necrosis.</p>\n<p></p>",
