      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Mallory-Weiss tear Mallory -Weiss tear is characterized by acute and sometimes massive UGI hemorrhage . It accounts for up to 10% of UGI bleeds. It is due to arterial bleeding following repeated vomiting (which causes mucosal tears at the GE junction). The cause is the same as that for spontaneous rupture of the esophagus (i.e., an increase in intra-abdominal pressure against a closed glottis). Causes other than vomiting such as paroxysmal coughing or retching, may sometimes lead to this condition. Upper endoscopy confirms the diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mallory - Weiss tear Mallory-Weiss tears are partial-thickness tears of the mucosa and submucosa near the gastroesophageal junction. These tears are caused by forceful contraction of the abdominal wall against an unrelaxed cardio, resulting in increased intragastric pressure and mucosal laceration. They were originally associated with alcoholic patients who had a history of intense retching and vomiting following binge drinking, but they can occur in any patient who has a history of repeated vomiting. Mallory-Weiss tears account for 5% to 10% of cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Diagnosis is usually made by history, and endoscopy is used to confirm the diagnosis. A retroflection maneuver is necessary to view the area just below the gastroesophageal junction to avoid missing this diagnosis in UGIB patients. Most tears occur along the lesser curvature and can extend into the esophagus. Supportive therapy with acid suppression therapy is successful in 90% of bleeding episodes, with the mucosa often healing within 72 hours. In rare cases of severe ongoing bleeding, endoscopic therapy with injection or electrocoagulation may be effective. If these therapies fail, angioembolization with absorbable material such as a gelatin sponge has been successfully employed.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Gastritis Erosive gastritis is caused by agents that disturb the gastric mucosal barrier; NSAIDs and alcohol are common causes. The NSAID-induced gastric lesion is associated with the inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase type 1 (COX-1) receptor enzyme, hence reducing the production of cytoprotective prostaglandins in the stomach. Many of the beneficial anti-inflammatory activities of NSAIDs are mediated by COX-2, and the use of specific COX-2 inhibitors reduces the incidence of these side effects. However, taken in long-term COX-2 inhibitors are associated with cardiovascular complications in common with many NSAIDs.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Stress gastritis is characterized by multiple superficial erosions that start in the proximal or acid-secreting part of the stomach and progress distally, almost always seen in the fundus and rarely in the diastal stomach. Impaired mucosal defense mechanisms against luminal acids, such as a reduction in blood flow, mucus, and bicarbonate secretion by mucosal cells, or a reduction in endogenous prostaglandins, is a key factor in the pathophysiology of stress gastritis. Risk factors or predisposing clinical conditions for stress gastritis include ARDS, multiple trauma, major burns, hepatic dysfunction, oliguric renal failure, large transfusion requirements, hypotension, prolonged surgical procedures, and sepsis. More than 50% of patients develop stress gastritis within 1-2 days after a traumatic event, and the only clinical sign may be painless upper GI bleeding that may be delayed at the onset. Treatment for stress gastritis involves definitive fluid resuscitation with correction of any coagulation abnormalities and treatment of the underlying sepsis. Intraluminal gastric pH should be maintained above 5.0 with antisecretory agents. Prophylaxis measures for stress gastritis include complete neutralization of luminal acid or antisecretory therapy, sepsis control, ventilatory support, adequate nutrition, and correction of dyselectrolytemia.

Approximately 10% to 15% of patients with PUD will develop bleeding as part of their disease course. PUD results from an imbalance between mucosal barriers and other aggravating factors. The major etiologic factors in PUD are H. pylori and NSAIDs, and in some patients, these can act synergistically in the development of ulcers through their additive insults to the gastroduodenal mucosa. NSAIDs also disrupt the mucosal barrier but via a different mechanism. NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenases (i.e., COX-1 and COX-2), thus impairing prostaglandin synthesis, enhancing neutrophil adherence, and subsequent mucosal injury. The most significant hemorrhage occurs when duodenal or gastric ulcers penetrate branches of the gastroduodenal or left gastric arteries, respectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Demographic changes have occurred in patients with duodenal ulceration in the West. The use of gastric antisecretory agents and pylori eradication therap y for dyspepsia has contributed to these changes. The peak incidence of duodenal ulceration is now in an older age group, and the gender difference is less marked. These changes reflect the changes in the epidemiology of pylori infection. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly found in the first part of the duodenum. Chronic ulcers can lead to fibrosis and deformities such as pyloric stenosis .
