Options B, C and D are false.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Growth charts are an important tool used to compare the growth of an individual to the growth of a normal population (the reference population). Thus, they may be used to define the abnormal growth of a child and track their progress through time. The most used anthropometric indicators are stunting (H/A), wasting (W/H), and underweight (W/A), and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC ) in children under five years of age and Body Mass Index (BMI) in adults. Height-for-age (H/A) : The term \u201cstunting\u201d is used to describe a condition in which children fail to gain sufficient height, given their age. Stunting is an extremely low \u201cheight- for-age\u201d (H/A) score. Stunting is often associated with long- term factors such as chronic malnutrition, especially protein-energy malnutrition, and frequent illness. It is therefore an indicator of past growth failure and is often used for long-term planning of policies and intervention programs in non- emergency situations.  Stunting is very sensitive to socio-economic inequalities. Weight-for-height (W/H) : The term \u201cwasting\u201d refers to a situation where a child has failed to achieve sufficient weight for height (W/H). Weight-for-height is normally used as an indicator of current nutritional status. Wasting may be the consequence of starvation or severe disease. It can also be due to chronic conditions or a combination of both. Weight-for-age (W/A): The term \u201cunderweight\u201d is used to describe a situation where a child weighs less than expected, given his or her age. Underweight is thus an extremely low \u201cweight- for-age\u201d (W/A) score. W/A reflects body mass relative to age. Unlike height, weight fluctuates over time and therefore reflects current and acute as well as chronic malnutrition. W/A is commonly used for monitoring growth and to assess changes in the magnitude of malnutrition over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The recommended reporting system of H/A, W/H and W/A is in terms of Z- scores\u2014 a statistical measure of the distance from the median (mean) expressed as a proportion of the standard deviation. The most common cutoff point is \u20132 Z-score, i.e., two standard deviations below the median values of the international reference. This is the cutoff risk level used to differentiate malnourished children from those adequately nourished. Children whose H/A, W/H and W/A scores fall below this point are therefore considered, stunted, underweight and wasted, respectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Anthropometric Index Percentile Cut-off Values Nutritonal Status Indicato WHO Growth Charts 2nd and 98th percentiles Length-for-age <2nd Short stature Weight-for-length < 2nd Low weight-for-length Weight-for-length > 98th High weight-for-length CDC Growth Charts 5th and 95th percentile BMI-for-age > 95th Obesity BMI-for-age > 85th and < 95th Overweight BMI-for-age <5th Underweight Stature-for-age <5th Short Stature</p>\n<p></p>",

Process denotes the transactions between patients and providers throughout the delivery of healthcare and thus is the most important factor for the assessment of the clinical management. Finally, outcomes refer to the effects of healthcare on the health status of patients and populations While there are other quality of care frameworks, including the World Health Organization (WHO): Recommended Quality of Care Framework and the Bamako Initiative, the Donabedian Model continues to be the dominant paradigm for assessing the quality of health care.

People infected with Y. pestis often develop symptoms after an incubation period of one to seven days. There are two main forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection: bubonic and pneumonic. Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. Plague bacillus, pestis , enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a \u2018bubo\u2019. At advanced stages of the infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores filled with pus. Human to human transmission of bubonic plague is rare. Bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs, which is the more severe type of plague called pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague, or lung-based plague, is the most virulent form of plague. Incubation can be as short as 24 hours. Any person with pneumonic plague may transmit the disease via droplets to other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague, if not diagnosed and treated early, can be fatal. However, recovery rates are high if detected and treated in time (within 24 hours of onset of symptoms). Plague is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissues, and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets. Plague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60% for the bubonic type, and is always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated. Antibiotic treatment is effective against plague bacteria, so early diagnosis and early treatment can save lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options B, C and D are false.</p>\n<p></p>",
