He has hypertension, well controlled on amlodipine 5 mg/d. He takes no other medications. He has never noticed cough or wheezing while at work. He worked for 15 years in construction and demolition and for 20 years thereafter in the service department of an automotive dealership. He denies fever, chills, or night sweats. On physical examination, he is in no respiratory distress but has right basilar dullness. His finger oximetry reads 96% on room air. Chest x-ray reveals a moderate right pleural effusion and lateral pleural thickening on both sides. Thoracentesis shows reddish fluid, which on formal analysis is an exudate with 45,000 RBCs/hpf. Cytology is negative. What is the most likely explanation for this patient\u2019s symptoms?",
