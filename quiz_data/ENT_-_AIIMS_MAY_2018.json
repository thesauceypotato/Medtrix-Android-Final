When the pressure in the EAC is increased, the TM is pushed medially leading to decreased mobility of ossicles and increased hearing (the increase in hearing occurs because by imparting a conductive hearing loss here upon increased pressure, there occurs masking of ambient noise). When the pressure is released the ossicular chain and the TM mobility is regained and the hearing becomes normal. This change in hearing on changing the pressure of the external auditory canal is Galle\u2019s positive. But if the ossicular chain is already fixed there will be no change in hearing with pressure changes. This is Galle\u2019s negative and will be seen in any ossicular chain fixity, e.g., Otosclerosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>TUNING FORK TESTS Test Normal Conductive deafness SN deafness Rinne AC > BC (Rinne positive) BC AC (Rinne negative) AC > BC Weber Not lateralized Lateralized to poorer ear Lateralized to better ear ABC Same as examiner's Same as examiner's Reduced Schwabach Equal Lengthened Shortened</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Fast eye movements of right eye to left side If spontaneous nystagmus is not present, then nystagmus can be induced for evaluating the cause of vertigo (peripheral or central). This can be done by: Caloric test : In this test we induce nystagmus by thermal stimulation of the peripheral vestibular system. Caloric test stimulates the lateral semicircular canal, the bulge of which is present on the medial wall of middle ear. By this test each labyrinth can be tested separately. Fitzgerald Hallpike test : This test is also known as bi-thermal caloric test because it is tested with cold (30\u00b0C) as well as warm (44\u00b0C) water, i.e., 7 degrees below and above the normal body temperature of 37\u00b0C. Here the patient lies supine with head raised 30 degrees forward to make lateral (or horizontal) semicircular canal vertical in which it is maximally responsive and the ears are irrigated with 30 and 44-degree Celsius water for 40 seconds with a gap of 8 minutes in each. Here the normal response is COWS, i.e., with Cold water (cold water makes the labyrinth hypoactive/paretic) nystagmus is towards the Opposite side and with Warm water (warm water makes the labyrinth hyperactive/irritative), it is towards the ipsilateral, i.e., same side.</p>\n<p></p>",

Also the pterygoid plates are pushed posteriorly which on CT appears as floating pterygoid. To see the intracranial extension or extension into orbits or infratemporal fossa CECT has to be augmented with MRI. Since it contains only blood vessels (angio) and fibrous tissue (fibroma) with no muscular coat (hence retraction does not occur), biopsy can lead to profuse bleeding and is contraindicated here.

Even though vestibular neurectomy is considered a hearing sparing surgery, since it is an intradural procedure, it carries a greater risk of complications than trans mastoid labyrinthectomy. Furthermore, since many patients whose hearing is preserved with vestibular nerve section may ultimately lose that hearing, the long-term value of hearing preservation is not well established. Although the combination of both procedures, in the form of a trans labyrinthine vestibular nerve section, is the most certain way to ablate vestibular function for patients with no useful hearing and disabling vertigo, some advocate for trans mastoid labyrinthectomy alone, considering that avoiding opening the subarachnoid space minimizes the possible intracranial complications. Chemical labyrinthectomy may be considered a safer alternative, but the risks of hearing loss when hearing preservation is desired are also high.</p>\n<p></p>",
