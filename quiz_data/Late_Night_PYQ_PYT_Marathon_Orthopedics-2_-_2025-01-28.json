Quantitative CT is a bone mineral density (BMD) measurement technique in which the CT scanner is calibrated using solid phantoms (made of calcium hydroxyapatite, representing various bone mineral densities) placed under the patient in a pad. With this calibration, the Hounsfield units are converted to bone mineral density values. The technique can be used for both peripheral and central BMD measurements, with lumbar spine and hip being preferred locations. DEXA measures the bone mineral density of both the outer (cortical) shell and the inner (trabecular) structure of the bone. QCT, on the other hand, measures only the inner part. Because of this difference, QCT studies of the spine show a lower T-score than a DEXA would.</li><li>\u27a4 DEXA scan is the investigation of choice.</li><li>\u27a4 Quantitative CT is a bone mineral density (BMD) measurement technique in which the CT scanner is calibrated using solid phantoms (made of calcium hydroxyapatite, representing various bone mineral densities) placed under the patient in a pad.
