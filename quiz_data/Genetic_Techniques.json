Human autosomes (chromosomes 1 through 22) and X chromosomes in females have two homologous loci in each individual, with two identical (homozygous) or different (heterozygous) alleles. Due to the autosomal recessive nature of the Hurler disease, both alleles have to be mutated for the patient to show a phenotype.

The viral RNA in the sample is first converted to cDNA using Reverse transcriptase enzyme and then cDNA is detected and quantified using viral-specific primers in a PCR reaction performed and monitored in real-time using fluorescent probes or dye. When the fluorescence reaches a particular threshold, the sample is said to be positive for virus infection.
