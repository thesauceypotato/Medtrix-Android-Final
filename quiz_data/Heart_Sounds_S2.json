A sufficiently large embolism causes acute pulmonary hypertension . In such a scenario, the thin walled right ventricle cannot contract well against such a large resistance and the hangout time is decreased causing early P2 and hence a narrow split.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A : It is seen in a number of causes including chronic pulmonary hypertension, where the RV is well adapted and hypertrophied, leading to a longer hangout time and delayed P2. Option C - Reverse splitting is seen in conditions that prolong LV hangout interval relative to the RV hangout interval resulting in delayed A2. Eg \u2013 Left bundle branch block, systemic hypertension, aortic stenosis . A single S2 may be heard on inspiration because of further prolongation of P2 due to greater volume to be ejected as a result of increased venous return, hence causing both the components to coincide. Option D - In ASD, the pressure across both the atria is equalized due to the septal defect. RV has more blood to eject and hence takes more time delaying P2 and the reverse occurs in the LV causing an early P2.
