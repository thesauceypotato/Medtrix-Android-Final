Epithelial pseudo stratification is present. Premenopausal women : Progesterone therapy: Medroxyprogesterone acetate for 21 days a month daily for 3months. or Progesterone containing IUCD. Postmenopausal women: Simple hyperplasia without atypia\u2013generally followed without therapy. Complex hyperplasia without atypia\u2013 cyclical/continuous progesterone therapy. These patients should be followed annually by endometrial biopsy. Atypical hyperplasia : The endometrial glands have cytologic atypia. The gland outlines are of complex hyperplasia in type. The nuclei of the glands show enlargement, irregular size and shape, hyperchromasia, and coarse chromatin. In this category chances of malignancy are high ( simple-8%, complex-30%, hence they are managed surgically). Ideal treatment is\u2013 Hysterectomy Premenopausal women willing to preserve fertility: High dose progesterone therapy after full information of risk of undiagnosed cancer or progression to cancer. In these cases periodic TVS a nd endometrial biopsy i s necessary. Carcinoma-in-situ : Commonly describes a lesion with severe cytologic as well as architectural abnormalities of the glands.</p>\n<p></p>",

Extrapelvic metastases are seen in the lung, lymph nodes (aortic), liver, brain, and bones. The majority (60%) of recurrences are seen within 2 years of initial therapy. Radiation therapy is the choice for isolated recurrence following surgical treatment: exenteration surgery for recurrent endometrial cancer is of limited value. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy have been used depending on the individual case. Cancer cervix: Recurrent disease Risk factors for recurrent disease are: Large tumor size, lymphovascular space invasion, positive lymph nodes, and advanced-stage disease. Most common site of recurrence is the pelvic side wall . Features of disease recurrence are Pain in the pelvis, and back, unilateral leg edema, ureteral obstruction, vaginal bleeding, palpable tumor in the pelvis, and lymphadenopathy. Single agent or multi agent chemotherapy with cisplatin, paclitaxel or ifosfamide is used. Palliative radiation therapy may be used for those who have been treated initially with surgery. Follow-up: The majority of the recurrences occur in the first 2 years. As such, the follow-up protocols should be at 3\u20134 months intervals for the first 2 years then at 6 months intervals for the next 2 years and thereafter annually. A thorough physical examination is done including an examination of supraclavicular and inguinal lymph nodes. Cervical or vaginal cytology is performed. Chest X-ray is done annual Cancer Ovary Metastasis The most common site s of metastases are\u2014the peritoneum (85%), omentum (70%), contralateral ovary (70%), liver(35%), lung (25%), and uterus (20%). Thus option b is incorrect. Option A,C, D: are correct option Management Principle of Management Remember-In cancer endometrium, staging is surgical, i.e. already we have performed TAH+BSO + dissected any enlarged lymph node (LN) or performed selective pelvic and paraaortic Thus treatment is mainly postoperative management Postoperative management of choice in patients with endometrial cancer is always radiotherapy. In stages III and IV:- Chemotherapy is given along with Radiotherapy. Only Patients with stage IA grades 1 and 2 do not require postoperative radiotherapy. Stagewise Management Stage I A grade 1 and 2 Surgery -(TAH) + (BSO) + LN dessection-(pelvic lymphadenectomy) if Tm size is > 2 cms. (No other postoperative therapy required). Stage IA grade III and IB (all grades) Surgery -TAH + BSO+Pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenec- tomy followed by radiotherapy (after 4-6 weaks) Stage II Modified radical hysterectomy with LN dissection (pelvic and paraaortic) followed by radiotherapy Stage III and stage IV Debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy Choice of Radiotherapy Radiation Type Used in Vaginal Vault Radiation Grade 3 tumor and Lymph vascular space invasion Whole Pelvis External Beam Radiation (Radiation field encloses upper half of vagina inferiorly, Lower border of L4 vertebral body superiorly and 1 cm lateral to margins of bony pelvis) Extrauterine pelvic disease including adnexal spread, parametrial involvement and pelvic lymph node metastases, in absence of extrapelvic disease Extended field radiation including entire pelvis, common iliac lymph nodes and para aortic lymph nodes Endometrial cancer with positive para aortic lymph nodes Radiation Type Used in Whole abdomen radiation therapy Done in stage III/IV Serous or carcinosarcoma Note-After the publication of GOG122, demonstrating the superiority of chemotherapy over whole abdominal radiotherapy in advanced endometrial cancer, the utilization of whole abdomen RT is not common...Novak 15th/ed p 1278</p>\n<p></p>",
