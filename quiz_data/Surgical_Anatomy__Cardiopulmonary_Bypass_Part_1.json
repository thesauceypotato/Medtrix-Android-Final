Intermittent cross-clamp fibrillation is a technique in which intermittent ventricular fibrillation is induced by a small electrical charge. The heart does not eject and is relatively still but not bloodless Option: D. Total circulatory arrest becomes necessary when visibility and clarity of the operative area is crucial.
