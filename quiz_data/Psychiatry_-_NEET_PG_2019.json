      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Polygraph Polygraph testing, also known as a lie detector test, is based on the principle that a suspect's physiological reactions can indicate their truthfulness or deception when witnessing an event. It measures various physiological responses such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and skin conductivity. These responses can be indicative of stress or anxiety, which might suggest deception.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Polygraph testing is based on the assumption that physiological changes occur when someone is lying, such as increased heart rate, blood pressure, and sweating. The polygraph measures physiological responses but does not directly determine if someone is lying or telling the truth. Polygraph results are not considered foolproof and can be influenced by various factors, including the individual's psychological state and the skill of the examiner.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Narcoanalysis: Narcoanalysis involves the administration of drugs to induce a state of deep relaxation and decreased inhibition, but it is not specifically focused on measuring reactions to witnessing an event. Drugs to facilitate narcoanalysis, thiopentone, scopolamine, methylphenidate. Option B. Brain mapping: Brain mapping, or functional brain imaging, is a technique used to identify brain activity patterns but does not directly assess a suspect's reaction to witnessing an event. Option C. Truth serum testing: Truth serum testing refers to the use of certain drugs to elicit information, but it is not specifically related to observing a suspect's reaction to an event.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Two most common drugs used in narcoanalysis are Sodium Amytal, which is also known as amobarbital or amylobarbitone, and Sodium Pentothal commonly known as thiopental or thiopentone</p>\n<p></p>",

Option C: Mania refers to a distinct mood state characterized by elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, increased energy levels, decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, and impulsivity. It is typically associated with bipolar disorder rather than intense depression without cause. Option D: Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by a range of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking and speech, and impaired social functioning.

During somnambulism, the patient's consciousness is not fully preserved. They are in a state of altered consciousness and are not fully aware of their surroundings.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Somnambulism is a parasomnia that occurs during NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep. The episodes of sleepwalking often happen during the first or second slow-wave sleep episodes (NREM stage III and IV).

Sleepwalking can be potentially hazardous, as individuals may be difficult to awaken and accidents can occur.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Sleep walking: This is true. Somnambulism refers to sleepwalking, where the individual carries out motor activities while asleep. Option C. Disorder of sleep arousal: This is true. Somnambulism is considered a disorder of sleep arousal, as it involves abnormal behaviors during the sleep-wake transition. Option D. Low level motor skill/function is present: During somnambulism, the individual can exhibit simple and complex motor activities both, which can range from simple actions to more involved sequences of semi-purposeful actions.
