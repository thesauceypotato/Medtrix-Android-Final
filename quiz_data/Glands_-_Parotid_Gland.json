They typically occur within the main confluence of the ducts and the main parotid duct. The patient usually complains of intense pain when salivating and tends to avoid foods that produce this symptom. The pain can be easily reproduced in the clinic by squirting lemon juice into the patient's mouth. Surgery depends upon where the stone is. If it is within the anterior aspect of the duct, a simple incision in the buccal mucosa with a sphincterotomy may allow removal. If the stone is farther back within the main duct, complete gland excision may be necessary.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pharynx examination is unnecessary The pharyngeal muscles receive innervation from the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerve to work in synchronization to propel food from the oral cavity into the esophagus The preganglionic fibres innervating the parotid gland begin in the inferior salivatory nucleus; pass through the glossopharyngeal nerve, its tympanic branch, the tympanic plexus and the lesser petrosal nerve; and relay in the otic ganglion. The postganglionic fibres pass through the auriculo- temporal nerve and reach the gland. It is important to examine the pharynx during the evaluation of parotid gland disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The facial nerve [VII] exits the skull through the stylomas\u00adtoid foramen and then passes into the parotid gland, where it usually divides into upper and lower trunks. These pass through the substance of the parotid gland, where there may be further branching and anastomosing of the nerves. Five terminal groups of branches of the facial nerve [VII]-the temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, and cervical branches emerge from the upper, anterior, and lower borders of the parotid gland. Facial nerve emerging out from the anterior border of the Parotid gland</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Accessory parotid gland is above the parotid duct The parotid is the largest of the salivary glands. It weighs about 15 g. It is situated below the external acoustic meatus, between the ramus of the mandible and the sternocleidomastoid. The gland overlaps these structures. Anteriorly, the gland also overlaps the masseter muscle. A part of this forward extension is often detached and is known as the accessory parotid, and it lies between the zygomatic arch and the parotid duct. Option B. Mandible ramus grooves anteromedial surface The anteromedial surface is grooved by the posterior border of the ramus of the mandible. It is related to: a. The masseter b. The lateral surface of the temporomandibular joint. c. The posterior border of the ramus of the mandible d. The medial pterygoid e. The emerging branches of the facial nerve Option C. Styloid and mastoid muscles are posteromedially The posteromedial surface of the parotid gland is moulded to the mastoid and the styloid processes and the structures attached to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Tumo u rs of the parotid gland The commonest tumours of the parotid gland are benign and typically involve the superficial gland. These include pleomorphic adenoma and adenolymphoma. Their importance is in relation to their anatomical position. The relationship of any tumour to the branches of the facial nerve [VII] must be defined because resection of the tumour may damage the nerve.</p>\n<p></p>",
