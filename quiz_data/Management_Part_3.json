The treatment of IDC typically involves surgery, such as a lumpectomy or mastectomy , followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. Hormone therapy may also be recommended for hormone receptor-positive IDC. Prognosis depends on various factors, including the size of the tumor, lymph node involvement , and hormone receptor status. Genetic testing may be recommended for patients with IDC, as certain genetic mutations, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 , can increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Breast-conserving surgery may be an option for some patients with IDC, but it depends on the size and location of the tumor. In some cases, neoadjuvant therapy may be recommended to shrink the tumor before surgery.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Carcinoma en cuirasse The most common complication observed in CA breast is seroma formation. Upper limb lymphedema is also seen in post-op cases with extensive axillary clearance & radiotherapy. Lymphangiosarcoma in a long-standing Lymphedema is called Stewart Treves Syndrome. Carcinoma en cuirasse is a condition where the skin of the chest is infiltrated with carcinoma and has been likened to a coat. It usually occurs in cases with local recurrence after mastectomy and is occasionally seen to follow the distribution of irradiation to the chest wall. It may respond to palliative systemic treatment but the prognosis in terms of survival is poor.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Option: A. Lymphedema Option: B. Seroma formation Option: C.

The given scenario can be managed by a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, & hormonal therapy (+/-) The surgery performed is called Breast-Conservation surgery (BCS) . It removes the malignancy with a surrounding rim of grossly normal breast parenchyma. Excision of the primary tumour with preservation of the breast has been referred to by many terms, including: Lumpectomy, Partial mastectomy, Segmental mastectomy, Segmentectomy, Tylectomy, and Wide local excision.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. The goal of breast cancer surgery is negative margins, typically achieved with a margin width of at least 2mm. There is no need for wider margins than this. Option: B. Radiation Therapy is the norm with BCS to reduce local recurrence. Option: C. Chemotherapy is recommended in patients with high recurrence scores in molecular tests.</p>\n<p></p>",
