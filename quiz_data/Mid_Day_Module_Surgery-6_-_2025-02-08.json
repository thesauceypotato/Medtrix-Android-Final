In node positive patients, BCT includes axillary lymph node clearance directly (without SLNB). In MRM, axillary clearance is done irrespective of clinical nodal status. Technique: methylene blue dye or radioisotope (technetium)-labeled albumin is injected into breast tissue (or subdermal tissue) at the site of the primary tumor or at the subareolar position. The sentinel node is identified as a blue node or as a radioactive node (using a gamma camera). The frozen section biopsy is sent to the pathologist for identification of cancer cells. If the biopsy is positive for cancer cells, then axillary dissection is simultaneously performed. The combination of blue dye and technetium-labeled colloid has been reported to improve the detection of sentinel lymph nodes.
