Lupus nephritis is a kidney inflammation caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Lupus nephritis can present with various histological patterns, including mesangial proliferation, membranous nephropathy, and focal segmental glomerulonephritis. IF staining in lupus nephritis can show various patterns of immune complex deposition, including IgG and complement (C3) deposits. Option: D. C3NEF disease is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of C3 nephritic factor (C3NEF), an autoantibody that stabilizes and activates the alternative complement pathway. In C3NEF disease, there is uncontrolled complement activation leading to consumption of C3, resulting in low serum C3 levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Types of Glomerulonephritis Glomerular Deposits IgA Nephropathy Mesangial Membranous Nephropathy Subepithelial Membranoproliferative GN Subendothelial Poststreptococcal GN Subepithelial humps Rapidly Progressive GN Crescents Lupus Nephritis Subendothelial Cryoglobulinemic GN Subendothelial</p>\n<p></p>",
