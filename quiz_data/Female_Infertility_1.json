Intrauterine insemination at the time of ovulation (the most acceptable method for cervical factor infertility) or GIFT (Gamete intrafallopian transfer) are very useful techniques in such cases.

Asherman syndrome Asherman syndrome is the presence of intrauterine adhesions. Pathophysiology: It is the result of scanty or poorly vascularized and dysfunctional endometrium resulting from trauma. Any insult severe enough to remove or destroy the endometrium can cause adhesions. Etiology: Asherman syndrome: \"Generally is the result of an overzealous postpartum curettage resulting in intrauterine scarification.\" ...Leon Speroff 7th/ed p 417 Most common etiology is: D and C done for postpartum hemorrhage. Other Etiologies: D and C done: After previous elective pregnancy termination. For missed abortion? For hydatidiform mole After cesarean section As a postoperative complication of: Abdominal/hysteroscopic myomectomy Metroplasty Septoplasty Uterine artery embolization for the treatment of uterine fibroids Chronic infection-like genital tuberculosis and Schistosomiasis or infection due to IUCD's. Symptoms: Menstrual disorders like (hypomenorrhea, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea). Hypomenorrhea is the typical symptom of Asherman syndrome. Infertility (it results due to the absence of viable endometrium for implantation as well as from obstruction of fallopian tubes). Recurrent miscarriage (due to insufficient normal endometrial surface) If patients of Asherman syndrome conceive, pregnancy is complicated by preterm labor, placenta accrete, placenta previa, and/or PPH. Diagnosis: Hysterosalpingography: (X-ray dye test) and saline hysterosalpingogram (fluid ultrasound) demonstrate a filling defect. Hysteroscopy is the method of choice for diagnosis and treatment. Treatment: Hysteroscopic lysis of adhesions is the preferred surgical treatment. Following surgery some method is used to keep the walls of the uterus apart in the immediate postoperative period to minimize the chances of recurrence. This can be done by the use of balloon catheters or nonmedicated IUCDs. Antibiotics are administered prior to the procedure and continued for approximately 10 days after the surgery.

Patient will have XY karyotype(no ovary), so, AMH and testosterone secretion are present by the functioning testis. AMH secretion inhibits mullerian genesis - no uterus, cervix, upper vagina. Due to receptor resistance, male external genitalia is not developed, and no androgenic effects on secondary sexual characters. Aromatase converts androgens to estrogen leading to breast development. Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (Testicular Feminization ) The condition is inherited as a X-linked recessive gene . The underlying pathology is a lack of androgen cytosol receptor or the receptor is defective (mutated). Clinical features : Usually presents with primary amenorrhea and or infertility . They are phenotypically and psychologically female . Breast development is There is a eunuchoid tendency (long arms, big hands, and feet). Absent or sparse axillary and pubic hai r External genitali a: looks The vagina is short and blind. Internal genitalia : The upper two-thirds of the vagina, uterus, and tubes are absent due to the effect of AMH. The gonads (Sertoli cells) secrete AMH (Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone). Gonads (testes) are either placed in the labia, inguinal canal, or intra-abdominal Investigations: Karyotype is 46, XY. Serum testosterone is within average for normal males. Serum E2 level is high and normal for males . Serum LH level is normal or slightly elevated. Confirmation of the diagnosis is by gonadal biopsy . Management :In androgen insensitivity syndrome (4 6, XY), Gonadectomy is done after Secondary sexual characters are delevoped as there will be an increased chance of gonadal malignancies . After gonadectomy supplementary estrogen therapy is indicated to prevent regression of the breast development, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular complications.
