      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Mondor's disease Mondor's disease is evident in the lateral aspect of the right breast in the image. Mondor\u2019s disease: Mondor\u2019s disease is thrombophlebitis of the superficial veins of the breast and anterior chest wall, although it may also occur in the arm. In the absence of injury or infection, the cause of thrombophlebitis (like that of spontaneous thrombophlebitis in other sites) is obscure. The pathognomonic feature is a thrombosed subcutaneous cord, usually attached to the skin. When the skin over the breast is stretched by raising the arm, a narrow, shallow, subcutaneous groove alongside the cord becomes apparent. The differential diagnosis is lymphatic permeation from an occult carcinoma of the breast. The only treatment required is to restrict arm movements. The condition usually subsides within a few months without recurrence, complications, or deformity. There are case reports of Mondor\u2019s disease being associated with the subsequent development of malignancy, although coincidental malignancy is more likely.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option A : Breast cysts are common in the 35- to 55-year-old age group and usually present as a painless lump Cysts are often multiple, may be bilateral, and can mimic malignancy Option B : An abscess presents as a fluctuant lump (in a deep-seated abscess fluctuation may be absent) with pain, signs of inflammation, fever, malaise, and difficulty in feeding. It may also be associated with enlarged tender axillary nodes Option C : Galactocele is rare and usually presents as a solitary subareolar milk-filled cyst seen during or just after lactation.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Low Molecular Weight Heparin This patient presents with fever, leg pain, warmth, edema, and erythema, 3 days after delivery, which suggests a diagnosis of postpartum deep venous thrombosis (DVT) . Compression ultrasonography confirms the diagnosis. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state; the risk of venous thromboembolisms reaches its peak in the first 6 weeks postpartum when hypercoagulability is accompanied by endothelial injury (e.g., due to surgical delivery) and possibly venous stasis (due to immobilization after delivery). Smoking also increases the risk of DVT , as does delivery via cesarean section, maternal age > 35 years, and preterm delivery. LMWH, administered subcutaneously, is the initial treatment of choice because of its immediate antithrombotic effect and safety during breastfeeding . If no significant bleeding has occurred, it can safely be started 12 hours after the caesarean section.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Embolectomy is not indicated in the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) but may be considered for patients with acute limb ischemia (ALI) within the first 6\u201324 hours to restore arterial blood supply in a viable, nonthreatened limb. Although ALI can manifest with acute pain, it is unlikely to cause significant swelling and redness Instead, patients with ALI typically have a source of arterial embolus (e.g., atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction) and present with a cool limb, decreased peripheral pulses, and possibly sensory symptoms. Also, Compression Ultrasonography confirms DVT. Option: C. Surgical fasciotomy is the treatment of choice to relieve the pressure, and thus, restore perfusion in patients with compartment syndrome. Acute compartment syndrome is a possible cause of postpartum limb pain, as it can be triggered by intrapartum hypotension (e.g., due to blood loss) or after the application of vasoconstrictive therapeutic agents (e.g., oxytocin to induce labor). In early stages, it can present with swelling, paraesthesia, and pain that is exacerbated by passive stretching or extension of the muscles; distal pulses are often initially palpable and do not rule out the diagnosis. However, physical examination typically shows very tight, \u201cwood-like\u201d muscles. This patient's examination findings suggest deep venous thrombosis rather than compartment syndrome. Option: D. Warfarin (a vitamin K antagonist) is commonly prescribed for oral anticoagulation in patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT); however, it is not indicated as initial monotherapy in patients with acute DVT. Warfarin monotherapy induces a transient hypercoagulable state in the first few days of therapy as it decreases anticoagulant proteins C and S because of their shorter half-life (6\u201310h) before reducing the coagulant factors II, VII, IX, and X (half-life of 2\u20134 days). To not worsen the patient's DVT and/or cause warfarin-induced skin necrosis, the initial therapy must contain another drug that has an immediate antithrombotic effect, before introducing oral anticoagulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The most common presentation of a DVT is pain and swelling, especially in the calf, usually in one leg; however, bilateral DVTs are common, occurring in up to 30%. The diagnosis of DVT and pulmonary embolism should be established by special investigations as the symptoms and signs are non-specific and may be absent.</p>\n<p></p>",

In cases of massive PE with hemodynamic instability (e.g., SBP < 90 mm Hg), thrombolysis with alteplase or other recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (tPA) is indicated. Because of the associated significant risk of bleeding, there are several relative and absolute contraindications to thrombolysis. Surgery within the past 10 days is a relative contraindication, but this patient underwent surgery 3 weeks ago. Therefore, alteplase would be the most appropriate treatment. Anticoagulation with heparin, Rivaroxaban, warfarin, or apixaban is also an appropriate treatment for patients with PE.

Hypotension, severe dyspnoea, and cough, as seen in this patient, are less common manifestations of type A (proximal) aortic dissection. The patient's CT scan also shows a vascular filling defect consistent with a pulmonary embolism rather than a tear in the aortic intima, which would be typical in a case of dissection. Option: B. Tube thoracostomy is used in the treatment of tension pneumothorax, which can manifest with dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, JVD, and hypotension, which are seen in this patient. However, her CT scan shows a vascular filling defect consistent with a pulmonary embolism rather than air in the pleural space with tracheal deviation, which is typical in cases of tension pneumothorax.

However, DVT would not show signs of inflammation (a tender, palpable cord with local erythema and induration or elevated temperature), and duplex ultrasound would not show vascular wall thickening or subcutaneous edema. Option: B. Varicose veins are common during pregnancy because the growing uterus places increased pressure on pelvic veins. However, they manifest as dark purple or blue, twisted, bulging, soft, non-tender cords, and usually show no signs of inflammation. Additionally, duplex ultrasound might show subcutaneous edema but not vascular wall thickening. Option: C. Lymphedema is a type of nonpitting edema caused by insufficient lymphatic drainage that occurs more commonly during pregnancy (pregnancy hormones induce changes in vascular permeability, promoting extravasation of fluids).

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the most common cause of pulmonary embolism. DVT of the left femoral vein would also explain this patient's more pronounced edema in the left leg.

A decrease in the LVEF can be seen with impaired left ventricular (LV) contractility or an increase in afterload. Pulmonary thromboembolism may result in a decrease in cardiac output but the LVEF is usually normal because LV systolic function and LV contractility remain unaffected. Instead, a dilated right ventricle with a decreased right ventricular ejection fraction would be more typical for patients with severe pulmonary embolism. Option: B. Depression of the PR segment on ECG is seen in acute viral pericarditis and atrial myocardial infarction. Acute pericarditis can result in tachycardia, dyspnoea, and chest pain that worsens with inspiration. However, other features such as fever and a pericardial friction rub would be present. An acute myocardial infarction can result in chest pain but the chest pain would usually be continuous without exacerbation during inspiration. Also, patients with an atrial MI usually have bradycardia due to heart blocks, or supraventricular tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. Option: C. A consolidation of the left lung base would be expected in patients with left lower lobe pneumonia, which can result in dyspnoea, tachycardia, and tachypnoea. A parapneumonic pleural effusion, which is often seen in patients with pneumonia, would also explain decreased breath sounds and pleuritic chest pain. Pneumonia, however, does not explain the asymmetrical pedal edema and jugular venous distention. Also, patients with pneumonia typically present with a cough and systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Some patients have no symptoms of thrombosis and may first present with signs of a pulmonary embolus, e.g. pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, and shortness of breath.

Initial treatment with warfarin is contraindicated in patients with HIT as it rapidly lowers protein C levels, which may transiently increase the risk of thrombus.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The most common presentation of a DVT is pain and swelling, especially in the calf, usually in one leg; however, bilateral DVTs are common, occurring in up to 30%.

The principle of using compression hosiery is that graduated external pressure improves deep venous return. There is no evidence that thigh-length hosiery is more effective than knee-length; hence keen-length stockings are more often prescribed, resulting in greater patient compliance. Compression hosiery is classed according to the pressure exerted and does improve symptoms. Option: C. EVLA can ablate any vein that can take a guidewire successfully, with a very low rate of recanalization. While the RFA catheter can be advanced over a 0.014 guidewire, in practice the relatively inflexible tip may not advance through very tortuous veins. Option: D. Following open surgery of saphenofemoral ligation and long saphenous stripping or sapheno-popliteal junction ligation and short saphenous vein stripping, complications occur in up to one in five patients (20%), with wound infection being the most common. Following long saphenous vein stripping, injury to the saphenous nerve occurs in up to 7% whereas sural nerve neuropraxia occurs in 4% after short saphenous vein stripping.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The adult prevalence of visible varicose veins is between 30%and 50%. Tourniquet tests and the use of hand-held Doppler have now been abandoned. There is good evidence to support the policy of duplex ultrasound scanning for all patients with varicose veins prior to any intervention. Many patients with asymptomatic varicose veins do not progress to develop complications, although a significant proportion do, and there is no clear confirmatory evidence that treating such patients prevents the development of future complications. There have been a range of studies comparing EVLA and RFA. The evidence is generally equivocal, with both treatments having very high efficacy (>95% closure rate), relative advantages, and disadvantages. Complications (minor and major) of standard varicose vein surgery are reported in up to 20% of patients who undergo traditional varicose vein surgery. Significant clinical recurrence 5\u201310 years following varicose vein surgery occurs in 10\u201335% of patients, but minor/duplex-detected recurrence is much more common, being of order 70%. Open surgery for recurrent varicose veins is associated with a high (40%) complication rate, the most common being lymph leak and wound infection</p>\n<p></p>",

In the calf and thigh, there are several perforating veins with valves that join the superficial to the deep venous system.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The small saphenous vein (SSV) originates from the lateral side of the dorsal venous arch and accompanies the sural nerve as it passes posterior to the lateral malleolus, then upwards in the posterior midline of the leg. In the proximal calf, it is usually found sitting in the groove between the two muscular heads of the gastrocnemius. Its termination commonly occurs by piercing the fascia of the popliteal fossa to drain into the popliteal vein at the saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ). However, this junction is highly variable and the vein may terminate as low as the mid-calf. The SSV may extend cranially beyond the SPJ, in which case it is known as either a cranial extension of the SSV, which terminates by piercing the fascia in the posterior thigh to drain into the deep system or the Giacomini vein, which communicates with the GSV system occasionally joining the GSV at or about the SFJ. In some cases, the SSV does not terminate at or below the popliteal fossa at all but continues on as described above.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. The saphenofemoral junction is situated 2.5\u20133 cm below and lateral to the pubic tubercle. This anatomical landmark is important when making an incision to perform groin dissection for varicose vein surgery. Option: B. The LSV starts at the medial part of the dorsal venous arch of the foot and is accompanied by the saphenous nerve in front of and above the medial malleolus. This anatomical fact is important when performing a venous cut-down for open intravenous access and not to strip a varicose vein down to the ankle. Option: C. The SSV originates on the lateral aspect of the dorsal venous arch and lies behind the lateral malleolus with the sural nerve. It ascends along the lateral edge of the Achilles tendon in the subcutaneous fat covered by skin and superficial fascia. In its ascent, it passes between the two heads of the gastrocnemius to terminate in the popliteal vein above the knee joint.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Up to 40% of the adult population in resource-rich countries have diseases of the veins of the leg.

Injection sclerotherapy alone can be successful in varicose veins <3mm in diameter and in telangiectatic vessels. Sclerotherapy acts by destroying the venous endothelium. Sclerosing agents include hypertonic saline, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, and polidocanol. Concentrations of 11.7 to 23.4% hypertonic saline, 0.125 to 0.250% sodium tetradecyl sulfate, and 0.5% polidocanol are used for telangiectasias.

Complications from sclerotherapy include allergic reaction, local hyperpigmentation, thrombophlebitis, DVT, and possible skin necrosis</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Sclerotherapy is the original non-endothermal, non-tumescent technique and has been performed for over 100 years. Outside of a small number of centers, the efficacy of UGFS is significantly worse than for endothermal ablation, leading to high reintervention rates, and the rates of complications such as phlebitis and pigmentation can be high. The adult prevalence of visible varicose veins is between 30%and 50%. Tourniquet tests and the use of hand-held Doppler have now been abandoned. There is good evidence to support the policy of duplex ultrasound scanning for all patients with varicose veins prior to any intervention. There have been a range of studies comparing EVLA and RFA. The evidence is generally equivocal, with both treatments having very high efficacy (>95% closure rate), relative advantages, and disadvantages. Complications (minor and major) of standard varicose vein surgery are reported in up to 20% of patients who undergo traditional varicose vein surgery.</p>\n<p></p>",
