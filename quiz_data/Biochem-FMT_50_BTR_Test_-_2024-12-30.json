He does not smoke, exercises regularly, and eats a balanced diet. His father died at age 56 from a myocardial infarction. His blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg and pulse is 110/min and regular. ECG shows ST elevation in the anterolateral leads. Coronary angiogram reveals proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis and thrombosis, which is treated with angioplasty and stent placement. Laboratory results are as follows: Total cholesterol: 160 mg/dL Low-density lipoprotein: 90 mg/dL Glucose, serum: 98 mg/dL Homocysteine, plasma: 21.5 \u00b5mol/L (normal: 4-14 \u00b5mol/L) Further testing reveals a homozygous mutation in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene that leads to decreased enzymatic activity. Due to this defect, the patient most likely has impairment converting homocysteine to which of the following?",
