      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Weakness & rigidity Upper motor neuron syndrome occurs when there is injury anywhere to the descending tract before the anterior horn of the spinal cord (cortex, internal capsule, pyramidal tract, lateral corticospinal tract). Examples of pathology that cause upper motor neuron symptoms are strokes, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), multiple sclerosis (MS), or anoxic brain injury. There are both positive and negative features of the upper motor neuron Positive features include hyperreflexia (abnormally brisk reflexes due to loss of inhibitory control on LMN leading to increased release of Ach on neuromuscular junction), spasticity (a brisk stretch of muscles causes a sudden increase in tone followed by decreased muscle resistance), and a positive Babinski reflex. Negative features include impaired motor control, easy fatigability, weakness , and loss of dexterity. Lower motor neuron syndrome occurs when there is an injury to the anterior horn cells or the peripheral nerve. Diseases of the neuromuscular junction or muscle itself may mimic a lower motor neuron lesion and are important to consider in the differential diagnosis. Similarly to an upper motor neuron lesion, the patient with a lower motor neuron lesion will present with weakness; however, distinct lower motor neuron lesion findings will include hyporeflexia, flaccid paralysis, fasciculations, and atrophy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>UMN lesion LMN lesion Site of lesion UMN starts from the motor cortex to the cranial nerve nuclei in the brain and anterior horn cells in the spinal cord.

Because alpha motor neurons themselves are spared, fasciculations do not Fasciculation occurs in LMN lesions Because of Denervation Hypersensitivity. The denervation of LMN signals formation of many many receptors for alpha motoneurons . Makes the extrafusal fiber with a high number of receptors present on them. A very little chemical change around extrafusal fiber now can create a contraction and fasciculations start appearing, which ultimately leads to fibrillation. Option C. Absent DTR- UMN lesion causes hyperreflexia (abnormally brisk reflexes due to loss of inhibitory control on LMN leading to increased release of Ach on neuromuscular junction ) , Absent DTR is seen in LMN lesion due to loss of Ach releasing nerve terminals at neuro-muscular junction. Option D. Localized muscle atrophy- is seen in LMN lesions whereas UMN lesions involve groups of muscles.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Motor neuron disease by anatomy- Diseases of the UMN- Hereditary spastic paraparesis Primary lateral sclerosis Diseases of both UMN+LMN Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Familial Sporadic Diseases of LMN Polio and polio-like enterovirus West Nile virus Kennedy\u2019s disease(Spinobulbar muscular atrophy) Spinal Muscular atrophy Progressive Muscular atrophy</p>\n<p></p>",
