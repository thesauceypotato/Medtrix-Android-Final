      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>If the life of the person is endangered, it is a case of Grievous hurt. From the given case presentation, it is a type of Grievous hurt as the victim was not able to follow his ordinary pursuits for a period of 20 days or more. Any hurt which endangers life, any hurt which causes the victim to be in severe bodily pain for a period of 20 days, and any hurt which prevents the victim from following his ordinary pursuits for a period of 20 days are classified under Grievous hurt. Any hurt which endangers life: An injury can be said to endanger life if it is itself such that it may put the life of the injured in danger. An injury caused on a vital part of the body cannot be called grievous hurt unless the nature and dimensions of the injury or its effects are such that the doctor is of the opinion that it actually endangers the life of the victim. Administration of a harmful drug to a person to make him unconscious is not grievous hurt, even though in some cases death may be caused if the drug is given in large doses. If the life of the person is not endangered, it is not a case of grievous hurt. To designate an injury as grievous hurt, danger to life should be imminent. Dangerous injuries are those which cause imminent danger to life, either by the involvement of important organs or structures, or extensive area of the body. If no surgical aid is available, such injuries may prove fatal. The concept of injury dangerous to life is not very precise. As such, it is not enough if the medical witness makes a simple statement that the injury in a particular part is dangerous to human life. He should place all relevant data, namely the nature and extent of injury, the kind of weapon used, the part of the body struck, whether the injury caused hemorrhage or shock, affected important structures or organs, or was very extensive, or otherwise caused imminent danger, and should also state the various grounds on which he considers the injury to be a dangerous one. Some examples of injuries that endanger life are: stabs in the abdomen or head or vital part, hurt causing rupture of the squeezing testicles, incised wound on the neck, compound fracture of the skull, rupture of an internal organ, and injury of a large blood vessel. Any hurt which causes the victim to be in severe bodily pain, or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits for a period of 20 days: The length of time during which a sufferer is in pain, disease, or incapacitated from pursuing his ordinary occupation is a defective criterion of the severity of a hurt. It is employed not only in cases where violence has been used but also in cases where hurt has been caused without any assault, e.g., by the administration of drugs, the setting of traps, the digging of pitfalls, the placing of ropes across a road, etc. The extent of the hurt and the intention of the offender are considered for giving punishment. It is difficult to prove that an injured person was in severe bodily pain for 20 days, but it is easier to prove that he was unable to follow his ordinary pursuits due to the hurt. The opinion of the doctor attending to the patient is important, on the point of his disability. A mere stay of 20 days in the hospital does not make injury grievous unless the injured person was in severe bodily pain, or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits for 20 days. Ordinary pursuits include acts of the daily routine of a person, such as eating food, taking bath, going to the toilet, etc. but do not refer to the duties that constitute the job of a person. An injury that endangers life may cause severe bodily pain for 20 days, but an injury that causes such pain may not be dangerous to life, but it is still a grievous hurt under this clause. The line between culpable homicide not amounting to murder and grievous hurt is very thin. In the former, the injuries must be such as are likely to cause death, in the latter the injuries must be such as to endanger life. The likelihood of death resulting from an injury will depend upon the severity of the injury, the structures involved, the age of the individual, and the state of health of the injured. Where there is no intention to cause death, or no knowledge that death is likely to be caused by the harm inflicted and death is caused, the accused would be guilty of grievous hurt if the injury caused was of serious nature, but not of culpable homicide. Any hurt which endangers life, any hurt which causes the victim to be in severe bodily pain for a period of 20 days, and any hurt which prevents the victim from following his ordinary pursuits for a period of 20 days is classified under Grievous hurt.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B.

Fifth Destruction or permanent impairing of the powers of any member or joint. Sixth Permanent disfiguration of the head or face. Seventh Fracture or dislocation of a bone or tooth. Eighth Any hurt which endangers life, or which causes the sufferer to be during the space of 20 days in severe bodily pain or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits. If it causes permanent disfiguration of the head or face it is included under Grievous hurt, disfiguration means the change of configuration and personal appearance of the subject by some external injury which does not weaken him/her. A person is disfigured when a reasonable observer would find the altered appearance distressing or objectionable.

Any hurt which endangers life means that the life is only endangered and not taken away, i.e. placing a person in danger of death. A mere stay in the hospital for 20 days will not constitute grievous hurt. Ordinary pursuits signify day-to-day personal acts of an individual, like going to the toilet, having food, or taking bath or wearing clothes. It does not include going to work, running, jumping, or driving a vehicle. Dangerous injury has not been defined in the IPC. Dangerous injuries are those which cause imminent danger to life by its direct or imminent effects because of being extensive in nature, involving important structures or organs of the body, and also being likely to prove fatal in absence of medical/surgical aid. Any tear in the dura mater, intracerebral hemorrhages, cerebral edema, laceration of lungs resulting in hemothorax, rupture/perforation of GIT, or any rupture of large arteries/veins are examples of dangerous injuries.
