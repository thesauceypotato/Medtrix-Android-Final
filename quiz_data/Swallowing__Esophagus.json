Given the slow, initially oligosymptomatic progression and relatively low prevalence of disease, achalasia can remain undiagnosed for years. It is due to increased resting LES tone and incomplete relaxation on swallowing. The myenteric plexus of the esophagus is deficient at the LES in this condition and the release of NO and VIP is defective. In terms of diagnosis, esophageal manometry is the gold standard to diagnose achalasia. It can be treated by pneumatic dilation of the sphincter or incision of the esophageal muscle (myotomy).

The liver secretes moderate amounts of Apo transferrin into the bile, which flows through the bile duct into the duodenum. Here, Apo transferrin binds with free iron and also with certain iron compounds, such as hemoglobin and myoglobin from meat, two of the most important sources of iron in the diet. This combination is called transferrin. It, in turn, is attracted to and binds with receptors in the membranes of the intestinal epithelial cells. Then, by pinocytosis, the transferrin molecule, carrying its iron store, is absorbed into the epithelial cells and later released into the blood capillaries beneath these cells in the form of plasma transferrin. Iron absorption from the intestines is extremely slow, at a maximum rate of only a few milligrams per day. This slow rate of absorption means that even when tremendous quantities of iron are present in the food, only small proportions can be absorbed.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option B.
