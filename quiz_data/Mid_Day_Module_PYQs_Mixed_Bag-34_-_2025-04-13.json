An autonomic response may be produced in response to a familiar face.</li><li>\u2022 Note - Prosopagnosia is not related to memory dysfunction, memory loss, impaired vision, or learning disabilities. The disorder is thought to be the result of congenital influence, damage, or impairment in a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate the neural systems controlling facial perception and memory (right fusiform gyrus).</li><li>\u2022 Note</li><li>\u2022 Face recognitions is represented mainly in the right inferior temporal lobe, but left lobe is also involved and injury to this area cause prosopagnosia.
