Fine Motor Skills: Feeding with a spoon requires the coordination of fine motor skills, such as grasping the spoon, scooping food, and bringing it to the mouth. Cognitive Development: Learning to use a spoon involves cognitive development, as the child needs to understand the concept of scooping and self-feeding. Delayed Development: If a 3-year-old child is unable to feed independently with a spoon, it may suggest delayed development in fine motor skills, self-help skills, or cognitive abilities. Evaluation : Delay in achieving this milestone may warrant further evaluation by healthcare professionals to identify any underlying developmental delays or potential concerns.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A. Make a Square: At around 3 years old, children may begin to demonstrate basic drawing skills, including drawing basic shapes like squares, circles, and lines. Absence of the ability to draw a square or other simple shapes may indicate delayed fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. OPTION B. Hopping on One Leg: Hopping on one leg typically emerges around 3 to 4 years old. The absence of this milestone may suggest delayed gross motor skills and balance development. OPTION D. Ride a Bicycle: Riding a bicycle with training wheels usually starts around 4 to 5 years old. The inability to ride a bicycle at 3 years old is developmentally appropriate, and its absence does not necessarily indicate delayed development.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Developmental Milestone Description Absence may indicate A.

The onset of JME is during adolescence, between 12\u201318 years of age. It was initially described as \u201cepilepsy with impulsive petit mal.\u201d The clinical features include myoclonic jerks preferentially involving upper limbs (like frequent dropping of objects). The jerks are sudden, non rhythmic, lightening-like muscle contractions without loss of awareness, characteristically occurring upon awakening in early morning hours. During the inter-ictal period, routine scalp EEG may be \u201cnormal.\u201d However, 4\u20136 Hz bilateral poly spikes and spike-and slow waves are observed in repeat or prolonged EEG recording.

OPTION B. Tonic-clonic seizures: Tonic-clonic seizures involve loss of consciousness, convulsions, and a post-ictal state. The absence of loss of consciousness and post-ictal state in the patient's presentation makes tonic-clonic seizures less likely. OPTION C. Atonic seizures: Atonic seizures, also known as drop attacks, involve sudden loss of muscle tone, leading to falls or dropping of objects. While the presentation of \"frequent dropping of objects\" could be associated with atonic seizures, the absence of loss of consciousness and the specific EEG findings described in the scenario (bilateral 4-6 Hz polyspike waves) are not typical of atonic seizures.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>EFHC1 (EF-hand domain-containing 1): Mutations in this gene have been found in some individuals with JME.

Early intervention is crucial to maximize the chances of success.
