They deliberately start fires to reduce tension and feel pleasure or relief afterward. Pyromania must be differentiated from a fire setting associated with a manic episode, psychosis, or substance intoxication.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A.

Option: B. conduct disorder requires a persistent and pervasive pattern of violating major societal rules or the rights of others that includes additional problem behaviors (eg, aggression toward people and animals, deceitfulness, theft), which this patient does not exhibit Option: D. Oppositional defiant disorder is characterized by a pattern of angry/irritable mood and defiant behavior toward authority This child's defiance of rules revolves around his fire setting, rather than being a pervasive pattern.</p>\n<p></p>",
