Often there will be menstrual efflux; however, depending on the degree of perforation or efflux, there may be retained menstrual blood with malodorous discharge, particularly with a micro-perforated hymen.

On examination, a bulging, translucent, or yellow mass is noted at the introitus . Surgical intervention is necessary only in symptomatic prepubertal patients. After confirmation of the diagnosis, surgical intervention usually is deferred until pubertal estrogenization has occurred because the imperforate hymen may open spontaneously at puberty. At puberty, a patient with an imperforate hymen typically presents with a vaginal bulge of thin hymenal tissue with a dark or bluish hue caused by the hematocolpos behind it. This bulge will distend further with the Valsalva maneuver. Option C: Normal finding \u2013 A semilunar hymen with intravaginally visible longitudinal ridges and mild periurethral dilatation. Option D: Annular or crescent-shaped hymen: These are considered the typical shapes of the hymen. In most cases, the hymen surrounds the vaginal opening at birth, like a doughnut (annular hymen).

However, during this canalization process, the membrane can vary in its resolution, leaving a complete obstruction, imperforate hymen, or any number of partial remnants, such as the micro perforate and septated hymen.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

This can lead to anemia, a problem involving insufficient transport of oxygen throughout the body.

The first stage of labour is further subdivides into two phases, defined by the degree of cervical dilation. The latent phase is commonly defined as 0 to 6 cm, while the active phase commences from 6 cm to full cervical dilation. The presenting fetal part also begins the process of engagement into the pelvis during the first stage. Cervical effacement refers to the cervical length in the anterior-posterior plane. When the cervix is completely thinned out, and no length is left, this is referred to as 100 per cent effacement The first stage of labour contains a latent phase and an active phase. During the latent phase, the cervix dilates slowly to approximately 4-5 centimetres. The latent phase is generally considerably longer and less predictable with regard to the rate of cervical change than is observed in the active phase. A normal latent phase can last up to 20 hours and 14 hours in nulliparous and multiparous women, respectively, without being considered prolonged.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A - Fetal head 5/5 on abdominal examination signifies the degree of descent in relation to the pelvic inlet and denotes the head is floating above the brim. Option B - Active labour with more rapid cervical dilation generally starts around 5 centimetres of dilation. During the active phase, the cervix typically dilates at a rate of 1.2 to 1.5 centimetres per hour. The absence of cervical change for greater than 4 hours in the presence of adequate contractions or six hours with inadequate contractions is considered the arrest of labour and may warrant clinical intervention. Option D - Rupture of membranes at or near term signifies the labour is likely to begin soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>More than 12 uterine contractions in 1 hour may signify labour onset. Partograph is charted every half an hour recording the number of contractions in 10 minutes and the duration of each contraction in seconds.

Once the placenta has been expelled the uterus is lifted out of the pelvis with the left hand. The principle of the Brandt-Andrews method is not cord traction but rather the elevation of the uterus.
