      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. D) Lacosamide</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Lacosamide has a unique mechanism of action among antiepileptic drugs. It selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels. While most sodium channel blocking antiepileptics (like phenytoin, carbamazepine) act on fast sodium channels, lacosamide specifically targets slow sodium channels. This mechanism helps stabilize hyperexcitable neuronal membranes and prevents repetitive neuronal firing.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Phenytoin : Incorrect. While it does act on sodium channels, it primarily blocks fast sodium channels, not slow sodium channels. It acts by promoting the inactive state of these channels.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Phenytoin</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Lamotrigine : Incorrect. Like phenytoin, it acts primarily on fast sodium channels and also affects calcium channels. It does not specifically target slow sodium channels.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Lamotrigine</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Felbamate: Incorrect.
