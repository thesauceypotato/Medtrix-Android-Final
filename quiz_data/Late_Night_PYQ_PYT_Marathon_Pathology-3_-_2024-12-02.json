This is a hallmark finding in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Pheochromocytomas are described as being \"composed of polygonal to spindle-shaped chromaffin cells and their supporting cells, compartmentalized into small nests by a rich vascular network\" - this describes the Zellballen pattern. Paragangliomas occurring at sites like the carotid body share similar features, as they derive from paraganglionic tissues.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Pheochromocytoma - This is incorrect because pheochromocytomas do exhibit the Zellballen pattern.

Pheochromocytoma</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Carotid Body Tumor - This is incorrect because carotid body tumors are paragangliomas that occur in the carotid body, a paraganglionic structure.
