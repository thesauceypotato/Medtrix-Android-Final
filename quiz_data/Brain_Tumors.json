In addition, she reports having severe headaches and an electric-type discomfort affecting her right deltoid region for approximately 3 weeks. On neurologic examination, she is found to have left abducens (sixth) nerve palsy; the rest of her cranial nerves are intact. She also has mild weakness of the right deltoid and a diminished biceps tendon jerk on the same side. Findings on an MRI of the brain with intravenous contrast are unremarkable.

These significantly diminish the amount of tumour-induced brain oedema and are remarkably effective in ameliorating symptoms caused by CNS neoplasms. This contrasts head trauma, where the CRASH trial has proven no role of steroids. The current recommendation for treating multiple brain metastasis is treatment with an entire course of fractionated radiation to the whole brain. This is geared to treat all visible lesions within the parenchyma and those that may still be too small to be detected. Intrathecal chemotherapy effectively treats meningeal carcinomatosis, where the primary site of involvement is the meninges and the brain's surface. When administered intrathecally, the two available agents for this treatment modality have poor penetration into deeper brain regions.</p>\n<p></p>",

The clinical presentation does not manifest until over 85% of ADH secretory capacity is damaged. Rarely is it nephrogenic and is caused by a lack of renal response to ADH hormone. The toxic effect of certain drugs or familial X-linked recessive genetic disorders often produces the nephrogenic form. DI is defined by increased diluted urinary output, constant thirst for usually cold water, and high serum osmolality . If it is not properly treated it can lead to extreme dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. The best test is water deprivation for 4 hours while monitoring the urine output and urine and serum osmolality. If urine osmolality remains flat or changes to less than 30 mOsm and the serum osmolality approaches 300 mOsm/L, the diagnosis of DI is confirmed. At this point, the patient should be given 5 U of an exogenous Pitressin subcutaneously. The extent of the DI can be determined by comparing the urine osmolality after Pitressin to the initial values. Increased urine osmolality by more than 67% indicates severe ADH deficiency. The increased levels of 6\u201367% is suggestive of partial deficiency.</p>\n<p></p>",

The temporal lobe is closely applied to the posterior frontal lobe at the Sylvian fissure, which carries the middle cerebral artery. Part of the optic radiation passes around the temporal lobe and can be affected by temporal lobe lesions. A contralateral superior quadrantanopia is seen in these cases. Temporal lobe lesions would not cause blindness in the ipsilateral eye or an ipsilateral hemiparesis \u2013 the motor cortex is in the posterior frontal lobe but supplies the contralateral limbs. The parietal lobe is sensory. Dominant parietal lobe lesions cause left\u2013right disorientation, finger agnosia, acalculia and agraphia.</p>\n<p></p>",
