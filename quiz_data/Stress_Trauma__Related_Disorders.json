      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Notify child protective services Child Protective Services must be notified immediately in cases of suspected child abuse . Findings that should raise awareness of child maltreatment include signs of physical abuse, such as scald burns, bruising, and multiple fractures at different stages of healing that are unlikely to have been caused by accidents . Fractures that are likely to have been caused by intentional injury include metaphyseal and epiphyseal corner fractures, rib fractures, and spiral diaphyseal fractures of long bones (e.g., humerus). A spiral fracture , as seen here, is typically caused by a strong torsional force on the limb, which is unlikely to be caused by a fall on flat ground while running. Along with the presence of an older, healing rib fracture (indicated by callus formation) that lacks adequate explanation, the suspicion of physical child abuse is warranted.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Children with nondisplaced, stable humeral fractures, as seen here, should be treated with immobilization of the bone using a sling or swathe for up to four weeks . But the next step should be to inform child services rather than sending him and asking for a follow-up after 4 weeks. Option: C. Screening for defective type I collagen can be used in the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) . OI typically presents with very fragile bones that are prone to fracture from minimal trauma, impaired growth, blue-tinged sclera , poor hearing , and dental abnormalities. Option: D. Measurement of serum calcium concentration would be indicated in children with suspected rickets . Severe rickets would typically result in softening of all bones and present with impaired growth (usually < 10th percentile for height), decreased bone density, and bone deformities (e.g., genu varum), which this patient does not have.</p>\n<p></p>",

However, this girl does not display the restricted interests, stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms, and language impairment commonly seen in ASD. Her history of neglect and hoarding, which is common in children who have suffered neglect, makes RAD the more likely diagnosis. Option: C.
