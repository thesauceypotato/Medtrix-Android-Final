      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Sodium cromoglycate Explanation: It is a synthetic hormone derivative which inhibits the degranulation of mast cells (as well as other inflammatory cells) by trigger stimuli. Release of mediators of asthma-like histamine , LTs, PAF, interleukins, is restricted. The basis of this effect is not well understood but may involve a delayed Cl\u00af channel in the membrane of these cells inhibiting activation. Long-term treatment decreases the cellular inflammatory response; bronchial hyperreactivity is reduced to variable extents. Bronchospasm induced by allergens, irritants, cold air and exercise may be attenuated. Cromoglycate is not a bronchodilator and does not antagonize the constrictor action of histamine, ACh, LTs, etc. Therefore, it is ineffective if given during an asthmatic attack</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Approaches to Treatment Prevention of AG:AB reaction-avoid- ance of antigen, hyposensitization possible in extrinsic asthma and if antigen can be identified.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hypertrichosis Minoxidil is a very efficacious orally active vasodilator. The effect results from the opening of potassium channels in smooth muscle membranes by minoxidil sulfate, the active metabolite. Increased potassium permeability stabilizes the membrane at its resting potential and makes contraction less likely. Like hydralazine, minoxidil dilates arterioles but not veins. Because of its greater potential antihypertensive effect, minoxidil should replace hydralazine when maximal doses of the latter are not effective or in patients with renal failure and severe hypertension, who do not respond well to hydralazine.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>How Minoxidil Works Minoxidil is approved for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia and alopecia areata. Minoxidil is available in a 2 percent solution and in a 5 percent solution. Topical Minoxidil is much more effective at treating baldness that occurs on the top, or crown, of the head than it is at causing hair growth on other parts of the head. Clinical tests on the effectiveness of topical Minoxidil in men with baldness showed that 48% of men who had used Minoxidil for one year reported moderate to dense re- growth of hair within the treated area,. Minoxidil is a treatment for hair loss, it is not a cure. Side effects of topical Minoxidil are rare and generally minor. Most common is scalp irritation or itching. Adverse effect of minoxidil Common ADRs of Minoxidil are fluid and salt retention and hypertrichosis. So the ADR is taken as an advantage and used for male pattern baldness as topical drops Rare adverse effects of minoxidil are Stevens-Johnson syndrome Glucose intolerance Serosanguineous bullae</p>\n<p></p>",

The drugs acting by inhibiting their synthesis (i.e. lipoxygenase inhibitors) or action (Cys-LT receptor antagonists) are useful in the prophylaxis of bronchial asthma. Zileuton is a 5-LOX inhibitor, that blocks LTC4/D4 as well as LTB4 synthesis. It therefore has the potential to prevent all LT-induced responses including those exerted by activation of the cysLT1 receptor. However, clinical efficacy in asthma is similar to that of montelukast. The duration of action of zileuton is short and it has hepatotoxic potential.
