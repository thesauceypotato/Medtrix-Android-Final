      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Fatty acids formed during the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols can be used as a carbon source in gluconeogenesis Option D: Fatty acids are broken down by \u03b2-oxidation to acetyl-CoA. But acetyl-CoA is cannot be used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis because acetyl CoA cannot be changed to pyruvate due to the irreversible nature of link reaction. So, acetyl CoA is never glucogenic .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option A: Lactate from vigorous muscle activity can be used as a carbon source in gluconeogenesis Lactate is formed by anaerobic glycolysis in muscle during conditions such as vigorous exercise or running. Once the conditions become aerobic, this lactate will pass into the liver to be converted back to glucose via the Cori cycle Option B: Glycerol formed during the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols is converted to glucose in gluconeogenesis Glycerol is formed as one of the products of TG hydrolysis along with free fatty acids. It can be converted to glycerol 3 phosphate and then to DHAP which can undergo either glycolysis or gluconeogenesis Option C: Lactate formed in red blood cells can be used as a carbon source in gluconeogenesis Lactate is produced in RBCs by glycolysis as RBCs cannot do aerobic respiration due to the lack of mitochondria. From RBCs, lactate is transported to the liver where it is converted to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate is a substrate for gluconeogenesis.</p>\n<p></p>",

In fasting, after the depletion of glycogen reserves body starts utilizing stored fats as the main fuel but muscle protein breakdown is also increased for the utilization of amino acids and catabolic intermediates for energy and to meet the demand for increased gluconeogenic substrates for maintaining blood glucose for vital organs . As a result of increased protein breakdown, ammonia is formed in the muscles which is mainly captured by \u03b1-ketoglutarate to form glutamate. Glutamate can also transfer some of its NH 3 to pyruvate to form alanine in the reaction catalyzed by ALT. This alanine is released from muscles which move to the liver via blood and is converted to glucose via pyruvate.

As shown in the flow chart below, the level of fructose 1,6 bisphosphate is lower than normal not higher in case of mutation. So, option A is wrong. Normally Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is the inhibitor of fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase (an enzyme of gluconeogenesis) and decreases the activity of fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase, Thus, decreasing the rate of gluconeogenesis and increases the rate of glycolysis. But now due to mutation , the activity of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is not decreased. So, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase will increase. So, its substrate (fructose 1, 6 bisphosphate) is decreased and not increased (option A is false and option B is true)</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Options: C and D: Less Pyruvate formed and Less ATP formed As the conversion of fructose 6-P to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is a committed step of glycolysis and with a decrease in fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the activity of the glycolysis pathway will decrease the mutant cells. With a decrease in glycolysis, ATP & pyruvate will also decrease . (options C and D are true statements )</p>\n<p></p>",
