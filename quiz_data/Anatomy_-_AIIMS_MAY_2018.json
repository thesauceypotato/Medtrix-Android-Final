The sensations of touch and pressure are conveyed by nerve fibers that terminate in the main sensory nucleus. The sensations of pain and temperature pass to the spinal nucleus. Proprioceptive impulses from the muscles of mastication and from the facial and extraocular muscles are carried by fibers in the sensory root of the trigeminal nerve that have bypassed the semilunar or trigeminal ganglion. The fibers cells of origin are the unipolar cells of the mesencephalic nucleus.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The trigeminal nerve is the largest cranial nerve and contains both sensory and motor fibers. It is the sensory nerve to the greater part of the head and the motor nerve to several muscles, including the muscles of mastication. Trigeminal Nerve Nuclei The trigeminal nerve has four nuclei: (1) the main sensory nucleus, (2) the spinal nucleus, (3) the mesencephalic nucleus, and (4) the motor nucleus. Main sensory nucleus: Lies in the posterior part of the pons, lateral to the motor nucleus. It is continuous below with the spinal nucleus. Spinal nucleus: The spinal nucleus is continuous superiorly with the main sensory nucleus in the pons and extends inferiorly through the whole length of the medulla oblongata and into the upper part of the spinal cord as far as the second cervical segment. Mesencephalic nucleus: The mesencephalic nucleus is composed of a column of unipolar nerve cells situated in the lateral part of the gray matter around the cerebral aqueduct. It extends inferiorly into the pons as far as the main sensory nucleus. Motor nucleus: The motor nucleus is situated in the pons medial to the main sensory nucleus.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Pain Temperature Touch Pain, Temperature and Touch all these sensations are relayed in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Motor Component of the Trigeminal Nerve The motor nucleus receives cortico nuclear fibers from both cerebral hemispheres.

During development, the vertebral column elongates more rapidly than the spinal cord, so that there is an increasing discrepancy between the anatomical level of spinal cord segments and their corresponding vertebrae. In later fetal life, the conus medullaris lies between the third lumbar and fifth sacral vertebrae.

PPRF The paramedian pontine reticular formation, also known as PPRF or para abducens nucleus, is part of the pontine reticular formation, a brain region without clearly defined borders in the center of the pons. It is involved in the coordination of eye movements, particularly horizontal gaze and saccades. B. Nucleus of raphe Magnus The raphe nucleus is considered to be part of the reticular formation and is located in the brainstem. It is responsible for the release of serotonin to other parts of the brain. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs, for example, are thought to act on the raphe nucleus. C. Cuneiform nucleus Neurons within the cuneiform nucleus send projections to the medullary reticular formation (MRF), which in turn projects to the ventral horn (VH) motor neurons, which control skeletal muscle tone regulated by both \u03b1- and \u03b3-motor neurons.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The PPRF is located anterior and lateral to the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) . It receives input from the superior colliculus via the predorsal bundle and from the frontal eye fields via frontopontine fibers. The rostral PPRF probably coordinates vertical saccades; the caudal PPRF may be the generator of horizontal saccades.</p>\n<p></p>",

Relation of inferior thyroid artery The inferior thyroid artery loops upwards anterior to the medial border of scalenus anterior, turns medially just below the sixth cervical transverse process, and then descends on longus colli to the lower border of the thyroid gland. It passes anterior to the vertebral vessels and posterior to the carotid sheath and its contents (and usually the sympathetic trunk, whose middle cervical ganglion frequently adjoins the vessel). On the left, near its origin, the artery is crossed anteriorly by the thoracic duct as the latter curves inferolaterally to its termination. Relations between the terminal branches of the artery and recurrent laryngeal nerve are very variable and of considerable surgical importance. The artery usually passes behind the nerve as it nears the gland. However, very close to the gland, the right nerve is equally likely to be anterior, posterior or amongst the branches of the artery, and the left nerve is usually posterior. The artery is not accompanied by the inferior thyroid vein.</p>\n<p></p>",

Sympathetic innervation to the adrenal medulla is via myelinated presynaptic fibres, mainly from the T10 to L1 spinal cord segments.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The suprarenal gland has a greater autonomic supply than any other organ. The nerves are distributed throughout the gland around blood vessels (regulating blood flow), in the medulla (stimulating the release of catecholamines from chromaffin cells), and in the cortex (where they may influence steroid hormone production). A suprarenal plexus lies between the medial aspect of each gland and the coeliac and aorticorenal ganglia. It contains predominantly preganglionic sympathetic fibers that originate in the lower thoracic spinal segments, reach the plexus via branches of the greater splanchnic nerves, and synapse on clusters of large medullary chromaffin cells.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- B. Adrenal medulla doesn\u2019t have nerve supply Suprarenal medulla is innervated by type B (medium diameter, myelinated) preganglionic nerve fibers. C. Adrenal cortex doesn\u2019t have nerve supply as it has endocrine functions The cortex is activated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland. ACTH subsequently stimulates the respective cortical zones to produce corticosteroids. D. Release of Catecholamines is not affected by nerve supply to adrenals Catecholamines are stored, together with ATP, Ca2+, and protein, in secretory vesicles known as chromaffin granules. Splanchnic nerve stimulation is the physiological stimulus for catecholamine secretion. Stimulation of the splanchnic nerves results in the release of ACh from nerve endings in the adrenal medulla.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The adrenal medulla consists of irregularly shaped cells grouped around blood vessels. These cells are intimately connected with the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). These adrenal medullary cells are modified postganglionic neurons, and preganglionic autonomic nerve fibers lead to them directly from the central nervous system.</p>\n<p></p>",
