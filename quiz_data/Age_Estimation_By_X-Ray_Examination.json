The radius and ulnar bone ossification centre have not fused. Hence it cannot be of 18 yr old. As all carpal bones are present along with pisiformis, the estimated age will be 10-12 years. Option: B. In image B, only two carpal bones are visible, so the estimated age for this will be, under 1 year of age.</p>\n<p></p>",

Xiphoid process fuses with the body at around 40 years. And the manubrium fuses with the body at around 60 years. Hence as in this patient manubrium is not fused, so his age is less than 60 years but more than 40 years at the xiphoid process is fused.

Head of the femur, Greater trochanter, lesser trochanter- all fuses at around 17-18 years. In this patient, all are fused. Also the last ossification centre to fuse here is ischial tuberosity, which fuses at 20-22 years of age. It is fused in this patient. Hence the minimum age of this patient should be 20 years. So the answer is C. 20 years.</p>\n<p></p>",
