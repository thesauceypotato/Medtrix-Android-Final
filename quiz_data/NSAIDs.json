      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Celecoxib Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body. Celecoxib is used to treat pain or inflammation caused by many conditions such as arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and menstrual pain.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Celecoxib is a selective NSAID and COX-2 inhibitor, which can be used to treat acute pain (equally in rheumatic arthritis and non-rheumatoid joint pain). Compared to nonselective NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors have reduced gastrointestinal toxicity, but nonetheless carry a minimal risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Therefore, close supervision of this patient is recommended due to a residual risk for gastrointestinal bleeding (especially in PUD). Unlike nonselective NSAIDs, selective COX-2 inhibitors do not have an effect on platelet aggregation, since platelets only possess COX-1.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Acetylsalicylic acid , Aspirin\u2019s chemical name is 2-Acetoxybenzoic acid. Aspirin, a chemical called acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is widely used worldwide as an anti-inflammatory and antipyretic drug. Formula and structure: the molecular formula for acetylsalicylic acid Option: A. ketorolac is used for short-term management of moderate to severe pain. It is usually not prescribed for longer than five days. Ketorolac is effective when administered with paracetamol to control pain in neonates because it does not depress respiration as opioids. Ketorolac is also an adjuvant to opioid medications and improves pain relief. Option: C. Ibuprofen is a medication in the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) class that is used for treating pain, fever, and inflammation. This includes painful menstrual periods, migraines, and rheumatoid arthritis. It may also be used to close a patent ductus arteriosus in a premature baby.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>In gout, because it can increase serum uric acid At therapeutic doses, Aspirin can cause hyperuricemia by decreasing the excretion of uric acid. It, therefore, should not be used in patients with gout. It also decreases the uricosuric action of probenecid. At high doses (>5 g/d), it increases the excretion of uric acid, but such high doses are not tolerated.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>MOA: Gout Drugs</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A- It should be avoided in diabetics because of the risk of hypoglycemia Option: B- Aspirin is contraindicated in children < 12 years old) due to increased risk of Reye's syndrome, which is a type of hepatic encephalopathy.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Bleeding time Bleeding time is a medical test done on someone to assess their platelet function. It involves making a patient bleed, then timing how long it takes for them to stop bleeding using a stopwatch or other suitable devices Uses of Aspirin As analgesic (300 to 600 mg during 6 to 8 h) for headache, backache, pulled muscle, toothache, neuralgias. As antipyretic in fever of any origin in the same doses as for analglesia. However, paracetamol and metamizole are safer, and generally preferred. Acute rheumatic fever. Aspirin is the first drug of choice. Other drugs substitute Aspirin only when it fails or in severe cases. Antirheumatic doses are 75 to 100 mg/kg/24 h (resp. 4-6 g daily) in the first weeks. Rheumatoid arthritis. Aspirin a dose of 3 to 5 g/24 h after meal is effective in most cases. Since large doses of Aspirin are poorly tolerated for a long time, the new NSAIDs (diclofenac, ibuprofen, etc.) in depot form are preferred.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B- Anticoagulant drugs prolong the CT. Option: C- Drugs interfering with intrinsic pathways (like heparin) prolong the aPTT. Option: D- Drugs interfering with extrinsic pathways (like warfarin) prolong the PT. Thrombin time is prolonged in cases of afibrinogenemia and dysfibrinogenemia. Adverse effects of aspirin: Side effects that occur at an analgesic dose (0.5\u20132.0 g/day) are nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, and increased occult blood loss in stools. The most important adverse effect of aspirin is gastric mucosal damage and peptic ulceration. Hypersensitivity and idiosyncrasy Though infrequent, these can be serious.
