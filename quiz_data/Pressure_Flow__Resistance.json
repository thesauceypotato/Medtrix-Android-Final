There is a net fall in total peripheral resistance due to vasodilation in exercising muscles.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Cardiac output refers to the amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute and is increased during exercise to deliver more oxygen and nutrients to working muscles. Option: B. Venous return refers to the volume of blood returning to the heart from the veins and is also increased during exercise to maintain adequate cardiac output. Option: C. Coronary blood flow is the blood flow to the heart muscle itself and is increased during exercise to meet the increased metabolic demand of the heart.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Local mechanisms maintaining a high blood flow in exercising muscle include a fall in tissue pO2, a rise in tissue pCO2, and accumulation of K+ and other vasodilator metabolites. The temperature rises in active muscle, and this further dilates the vessels. Dilation of the arterioles and precapillary sphincters causes a 10 to 100-fold increase in the number of open capillaries.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Kidney The kidney has the most permeable capillaries among the options provided. This is because the kidney is responsible for the filtration of blood and the formation of urine. The glomerular capillaries are the places where the filtration part of urine production occurs. Therefore, the endothelial walls of these capillaries are fenestrated to make them more permeable than capillaries elsewhere, so more fluid is filtered at a given filtration pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Special Types of \u201cPores\u201d Occur in the Capillaries of Certain Organs. The \u201cpores\u201d in the capillaries of some organs have special characteristics to meet the peculiar needs of the organs. Some of these characteristics are as follows: In the brain, the junctions between the capillary endothelial cells are mainly \u201ctight\u201d junctions that allow only extremely small molecules such as water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide to pass into or out of the brain tissues. In the liver, the opposite is true. The clefts between the capillary endothelial cells are wide open so that almost all dissolved substances of the plasma, including the plasma proteins, can pass from the blood into the liver tissues. The pores of the gastrointestinal capillary membranes are midway in size between those of the muscles and those of the liver. In the glomerular capillaries of the kidney, numerous small oval windows called fenestrae to penetrate all the way through the middle of the endothelial cells so that tremendous amounts of small molecular and ionic substances (but not the large molecules of the plasma proteins) can filter through the glomeruli without having to pass through the clefts between the endothelial cells.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A. The capillaries in the posterior pituitary gland are fenestrated, which means they have small pores that allow for the easy diffusion of molecules between the blood and the surrounding tissue. Option: B. The liver's capillaries, known as sinusoids, are largely permeable due to their unique structure. Option: D. Largely permeable is because the small intestine plays a crucial role in the absorption of nutrients from the digested food.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Capillaries have the highest total cross-sectional area and lowest flow velocity. Pressure gradient drives flow from high pressure to low pressure. Arterioles account for most of TPR. Veins provide most of the blood storage capacity. Viscosity depends mostly on hematocrit. Viscosity \u2191 in hyperproteinemic states (eg, multiple myeloma), polycythemia. Viscosity in anemia.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Increased total cross-sectional area, decreased blood flow velocity, decreased mean blood pressure Arterioles and capillaries have more cross-sectional area than the artery due to the massive branching of arterioles and capillaries. So there will be an increased total cross-sectional area of the capillaries. We know that velocity= Q/A where A is cross-sectional area So the velocity is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional That means velocity of blood flow will decrease as blood moves from arteries to capillaries. Mean blood pressure decreases in arterioles and capillaries due to increased cross-sectional area of these. So the correct answer is D The rest of the other options are false.s</p>\n<p></p>",
