Aqueous humour is derived from plasma within the capillary network of ciliary processes. The three mechanisms of diffusion , ultrafiltration, and secretion (active transport) play a part in its production at different levels. Substances that are actively transported include sodium, chlorides, potassium, ascorbic acid, amino acids, and bicarbonates. Active transport of these substances across the non pigmented ciliary epithelium results in an osmotic gradient leading to the movement of other plasma constituents into the posterior by ultrafiltration and diffusion. Sodium is primarily responsible for the movement of water into the posterior chamber.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Aqueous humour is produced by the ciliary body, in uveoscleral route , it flows from posterior chamber through the pupil into the anterior chamber.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option : A .

The active transport is brought about by the Na+-K+ activated ATPase pump , calcium and voltage gated ion channels, and carbonic anhydrase enzyme system.

Aqueous flow through the aqueous outflow system has long been considered a passive filter mechanism against the pressure gradient .

Aqueous outflow pumps operate through oscillatory pressure transients caused by the ocular pulse, blinking, and eye movements. Option: B . Trabecular meshwork actively moves outward and recoils back in response to the oscillatory pressure transients. Thus, trabecular meshwork flexibility is essential for the aqueous outflow pump mechanism. Option: C . Aqueous outflow pump systems are part of the vascular circulatory loop. During cardiac diastole the IOP is slightly decreased due to less blood flow to the choroidal vasculature. As a consequence, the trabecular meshwork is retracted inward, leading to a negative pressure inside the Schlemm\u2019s canal and opening of the aqueous valves.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Mitochondrial Function Raised IOP is an important risk factor in the development of glaucoma and can be modified with treatment. However, it is difficult to justify the treatment of all individuals with raised IOP because of the high prevalence of ocular hypertension . Thus, it is very important to identify the risk factors, or so called alarming red flags, to avoid the glaucomatous process. Recent studies have suggested a major role for angiopoietin - receptor tyrosine kinase signalling , lipid metabolism , mitochondrial function, and developmental processes as risk factors for elevated IOP.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Diagnostic evaluation Regular eye examination - Ophthalmoscopy Slit lamp examination gonioscopy Tonometry</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B.

The CCT can be determined using optical imaging. Option: C. Pre-perimetric glaucoma refers to glaucomatous damage, usually manifested by a suspicious optic disc and/or the presence of retinal nerve fibre layer defects, in which no visual field abnormality has developed. Although the absence of visual field abnormalities does not pose an alarmingly great risk for the presence of glaucomatous damage; it should not completely negate the presence of glaucomatous damage. Option: D. Diurnal variations with high pressures are commonly recorded early in the morning or late at night. However, these variations only cause short-term changes, with values going back to the baseline ranges once the time passes.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Management Medical management : beta blockers, miotics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, prostaglandin analogues Surgical management : argon laser trabeculoplasty, laser iridotomy, trabeculectomy.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Intraocular Pressure The measurement of IOP (ocular tension) should be made in all suspected cases of glaucoma and in routine after the age of 40 years. A rough estimate of IOP can be made by digital tonometry . For this procedure, the patient is asked to look down, and the eyeball is palpated by index fingers of both the hands, through the upper lid, beyond the tarsal plate. One finger is kept stationary, which feels the fluctuation produced by the indentation of the globe by the other finger (Fig. 23.11). It is a subjective method and needs experience. When IOP is raised, fluctuation produced is feeble or absent and the eyeball feels firm to hard. When IOP is very low, the eye feels soft like a partially filled water bag .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The exact measurement of IOP is done by an instrument called a tonometer .
