Hypoglycemia can occur in any diabetic following inadvertent injection of a large dose, by missing a meal after injection, or by performing vigorous exercise. The symptoms can be divided into those due to counter-regulatory sympathetic stimulation, sweating, anxiety, palpitation, tremor; and those due to deprivation of the brain of its essential nutrient glucose ( neuroglycopenic symptoms) -dizziness, headache, behavioral changes, visual disturbances, hunger, fatigue, weakness, muscular incoordination and sometimes fall in BP. Generally, the reflex sympathetic symptoms occur, before the neuroglycopenic , but the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia differ from patient to patient and also depend on the rate of fall in blood glucose Diabetic neuropathy can abolish autonomic symptoms. Hypoglycemic unawareness (loss of warning symptoms) tends to develop in patients who experience frequent episodes of hypoglycemia. Finally, when blood glucose falls further ( to < 40 mg/dl ) mental confusion, abnormal behavior, seizures, and coma Irreversible neurological deficits are the sequelae of prolonged hypoglycemia. Treatment - Glucose (or glucose-yielding carbohydrate, e.g. sugar) 15\u201320 g orally reverses the symptoms rapidly in most cases. If no improvement occurs, the same amount may be repeated after 15\u201320 min. In severe cases 30\u201350 ml of 50% glucose may be injected i.v. over 10 min. Glucagon 0.5\u20131 mg i.v. or Adr 0.2 mg s.c. (less desirable) maybe given as an expedient measure in patients who are not able to take sugar orally and injectable glucose is not available. Local reactions - Swelling, erythema, and stinging sometimes occur at the injected site, especially in the beginning. Lipodystrophy of the subcutaneous fat around the injection site occurred occasionally with the older pork/beef insulin preparations. This is rare with the newer preparations. Allergy This is due to contaminating proteins and is very rare with human/highly purified insulins. Urticaria , angioedema, and anaphylaxis are the manifestations.

Two TR isoform families (TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2) have been identified. Both bind T3 and function in a similar manner, but their tissue distribution differs, which may account for quantitative differences in the sensitivity of different tissues to T3 In contrast to the steroid receptor, the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor (TR) resides in the nucleus even in the unliganded inactive state. It is bound to the \u2018thyroid hormone response element\u2019 (TRE) in the enhancer region of the target genes along with corepressors (This keeps gene transcription suppressed.) When T3 binds to the ligand-binding domain of TR, it heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and undergoes a conformational change releasing the corepressor and binding the coactivator. This induces gene transcription followed by the production of specific mRNA and a specific pattern of protein synthesis which produces the various metabolic and anatomic effects. The expression of certain genes is repressed by T3. In their case, the unliganded TR allows gene transcription, while binding of T3 to TR halts the process. Many of the effects of T3 e.g. tachycardia, arrhythmias, raised BP, tremors, and hyperglycemia are mediated, at least partly, by sensitization of adrenergic receptors to catecholamines. Induction of adenylyl cyclase, the proliferation of \u03b2 adrenoceptors, and a better coupling between these two have been demonstrated. Apart from the nuclear T3 receptor, other sites of thyroid hormone action have been described. It acts on cell membranes to enhance amino acid and glucose entry and on mitochondria to increase oxygen consumption. At these sites, T4 appears to be equipotent to T3 , which the nuclear receptor, T4 has a much lower affinity. Moreover, even on binding to the TR, T4 does not promote gene transcription.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.

Fertility is impaired in hypothyroidism and women suffer from oligomenorrhea. Normal thyroid function is required for the maintenance of pregnancy and lactation. During pregnancy, Induced by estrogen \u2192 thyroxine binding globulin is increased - PBI(Protein Bound Iodine) levels are elevated , but there is no effect on thyroid status because the concentration of free hormone remains unchanged. There will be a small amount of transplacental passage of L-T4 from mother to fetus. Therefore, A higher dose of levothyroxine is usually required in pregnant patients. Overt hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage , fetal distress , preterm delivery, and impaired psychosexual and motor development in the progeny. As part of pre-pregnancy planning, the dose of levothyroxine should be adjusted to maintain the TSH in the lower portion of the reference range. Levothyroxine (LT4) remains the mainstay of treatment of hypothyroidism in pregnant women. Women already diagnosed with hypothyroidism should have their TSH levels checked before conception or as soon as their pregnancy is confirmed to timely adjust the dosage of LT4. Various studies have proposed, that hypothyroid women can increase their LT4 dosage by approximately 30% as soon as the pregnancy is confirmed, thus anticipating the increased need.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options: B, C & D are incorrect.

Iodide limits its own transport and acutely and transiently inhibits the synthesis of iodotyrosine and iodothyronines : The Wolff-Chaikoff effect is an effective means of rejecting large quantities of iodide and therefore preventing the thyroid from synthesizing large quantities of thyroid hormones . An important clinical effect of high iodine in plasma is the inhibition of the release of thyroid hormone. This action is rapid and efficacious in severe thyrotoxicosis.

Iodide limits its own transport and acutely and transiently inhibits the synthesis of iodotyrosine and iodothyronines : The Wolff-Chaikoff effect is an effective means of rejecting large quantities of iodide and therefore preventing the thyroid from synthesizing large quantities of thyroid hormones . An important clinical effect of high iodine in plasma is the inhibition of the release of thyroid hormone. This action is rapid and efficacious in severe thyrotoxicosis. The effect is exerted directly on the thyroid gland and can be demonstrated in the euthyroid subject as well as in the hyperthyroid E.g., NaI KI Lugol\u2019s Iodine(5% iodine in 10% Pot. iodide solution) Note- Lithium also inhibits the release of T3, T4 Uses - Preoperative preparation for thyroidectomy in Graves\u2019 disease: Iodine is generally given for 10 days just preceding surgery. The aim is to make the gland firm, less vascular, and easier to operate on. Though iodide itself will lower the thyroid status, it cannot be relied upon to attain euthyroidism which is done by the use of carbimazole before starting iodide. Propranolol may be given additionally for rapid control of symptoms. Thyroid storm Lugol\u2019s iodine (6\u201310 drops) or Iodine containing radiocontrast media (iopanoic acid/ipodate) orally are used to stop any further release of T3 /T4 from the thyroid and to decrease T4 to T3 conversion.
