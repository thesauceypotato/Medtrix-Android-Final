Colles fracture is fracture of lower end of radius at its corticocancellous junction mostly occurring in post-menopausal osteoporotic elderly women; as a result of fall on outstretched hand, with wrist in extension. It is one of the most common fractures in elderly. Radiographically, the fracture appears extra-articular and usually proximal to the radioulnar joint. Dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present. If dorsal angulation is severe enough, a dinner fork deformity may be described. There is also shortening of the radius. An associated ulnar styloid fracture is present in up to 50% of cases.</li><li>\u2022 Option B</li><li>\u2022 Colles Fracture.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Scaphoid fracture. The wrist bone below the base of the thumb is known as the scaphoid bone. A fracture of this bone can happen when a person falls onto outstretched hands. This type of fracture does not happen very often in young children because this bone is mostly cartilage. A lucent line across the waist of the scaphoid is the commonest site for fracture. However, displaced and non-displaced fractures of the proximal and distal pole may be seen.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.</li><li>\u2022 Scaphoid fracture.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Osteoporosis . Osteoporosis is reduction in bone mass (density) i.e. there is quantitative decrease of units of bone formation but each unit has qualitatively normal configuration. So, osteoporosis characteristically has normal calcium, phosphate and alkaline phoshatase levels. In tubular bones especially metacarpals, there will be thinning of the cortex. Cortical thickness of <25% of the whole thickness of the metacarpal signifies osteoporosis (normal is 25-33%).</li><li>\u2022 Option D.</li><li>\u2022 Osteoporosis</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective</li><li>\u27a4 This given wrist X- ray shows rickets.

Rickets is a condition primarily caused by a deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. It affects the mineralization of bones and can lead to deformities. In the growing skeleton, the deficiency of normal mineralization is most evident at metaphyseal zones of provisional calcification where there is an excess of non-mineralized osteoid resulting in growth plate widening and abnormal configuration of the metaphysis in the form of fraying (indistinct margins of the metaphysis), splaying (wide metaphyseal ends), cupping (concave metaphysis), and pseudofracture on the compression side of bone. They are most prominent at the bones where growth is greatest i.e., distal femur, proximal tibia, wrist especially the ulna, and anterior rib ends (rachitic rosary).</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Rickets.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Hyperparathyroidism . Hyperparathyroidism involves an overactive parathyroid gland leading to excessive levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). This can result in increased calcium reabsorption from bones, causing bone resorption. Radiographically, there is subperiosteal bone resorption seen in the 2 nd and 3 rd phalanges, tibia, femur and humerus; subchondral resorption in lateral end clavicle, pubic symphysis and SI joints; subligamentous resorption in ischial tuberosity, trochanters, calcaneus and clavicle, rugger jersey spine, osteopenia, brown tumors, salt-pepper skull are seen.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Hyperparathyroidism</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Osteomalacia . Osteomalacia is a condition characterized by softening of the bones due to inadequate mineralization. It is often caused by a deficiency of vitamin D, resulting in impaired calcium and phosphate metabolism.
