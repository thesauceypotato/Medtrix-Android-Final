Due to which surface tension increases and compliance decreases.</li><li>\u2022 Surfactant (Lecithin/Dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl Choline) is produced by specialized cells called type II alveolar cells in the lungs. Surfactant molecules have a hydrophilic (water-attracting) head and a hydrophobic (water-repellent) tail. This unique structure allows surfactant to lower the surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveoli. It reduces the attractive forces between water molecules, preventing the alveoli from collapsing during expiration.</li><li>\u2022 Compliance refers to the ability of the lungs to expand and recoil efficiently during breathing. Without surfactant, the surface tension within the alveoli would be high, making it difficult for the lungs to inflate during inspiration and causing them to collapse more readily during expiration.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective</li><li>\u27a4 In preterm infants, especially those born before the lungs have matured at around 28 weeks, the lack of adequate surfactant leads to increased surface tension and decreased compliance, contributing to the development of respiratory distress syndrome.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Cardioversion is performed using a defibrillator that synchronizes with the patient\u2019s QRS complex, delivering an electrical shock during ventricular depolarization to avoid inducing ventricular fibrillation.
