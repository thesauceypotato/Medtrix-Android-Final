Options A, C & D. are false.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Bandl's ring is a pathological retraction ring seen predominantly in obstructed labour. It is a constriction between a woman's thickened upper contractile uterine segment and thinned lower uterine segment (LUS) during parturition. The uterine muscle creates a band in which the baby's head or shoulders remains trapped, leading to the inability to deliver the infant. It is believed that prolonged labour may play a role in the development of a Bandl's ring. The constriction ring (Options C and D) also known as Schroeder's ring is formed due to injudicious use of oxytocin and premature rupture of membranes.</p>\n<p></p>",
