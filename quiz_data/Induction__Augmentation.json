Provided women with twins meet all criteria for oxytocin administration, it may be used.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Augmentation of labour is the process of stimulating the uterus to increase the frequency, duration and intensity of contractions after the onset of spontaneous labour. It has commonly been used to treat delayed labour when poor uterine contractions are assessed to be the underlying cause. Prolonged labour: Also known as \u201cfailure to progress,\u201d this can cause low oxygen levels and abnormal heart rhythms in your little one. If the baby isn\u2019t born after 18-24 hours of regular contractions, augmentation of labour may be recommended. Preeclampsia: The stress of delivery paired with preeclampsia or other hypertension disorders can affect the baby, and a quicker delivery can be advantageous. Premature rupture of the membranes (PROM): In most pregnancies, water will break after contractions begin. However if the amniotic sac ruptures before, or early on in contractions, the woman is on the clock to deliver the baby within 24-48 hours to prevent infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option B : Amniotomy decreases the need for oxytocin use. Amniotomy with oxytocin augmentation for arrested active-phase labour shortened the time to delivery by 44 minutes compared with that of oxytocin alone. Option C : Methods of augmentation do increase the risk of operational management. Option D : Associated with a risk of uterine hyperstimulation is true.</p>\n<p></p>",
