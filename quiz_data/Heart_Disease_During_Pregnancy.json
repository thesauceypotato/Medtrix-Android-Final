Point 1 Maternal mortality is lowest in rheumatic heart lesions and a cyanotic group of heart diseases\u2014less than 1 percent. With an elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance, especially with cyanotic heart lesions, the mortality may be increased to even 50 percent (Eisenmenger\u2019s syndrome).

Maternal mortality is lowest in rheumatic heart lesions and acyanotic group of heart diseases-less than 1%. With elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance especially with cyanotic heart lesions, the mortality may be raised to even 50% (Eisenmenger's syndrome).

T he other causes of death are- (a) pulmonary edema (b) pulmonary embolism (c) active rheumatic carditis (d) subacute bacterial endocarditis and (e) rupture of cerebral aneurysm in coarctation of aorta. However, with improved medical care, surgical correction of the congenital lesions and better obstetric care, the maternal mortality has been reduced markedly. Pregnancy however, does not affect the long- term survival of a woman with rheumatic heart lesion provided she survives pregnancy itself. FETAL: In rheumatic heart lesions, the fetal outcome is usually good and in no way different from the patients without any heart lesion. However, in cyanotic group of heart lesion, there is increased fetal loss (45%) due to abortion, IUGR and prematurity. Fetal congenital cardiac disease is increased by 3-10% if either of the parents have congenital lesions.</p>\n<p></p>",

(iv) Left ventricular dysfunction as evidenced by echocardiography\u2014(a) Ejection fraction less than 45 percent and (b) Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension more than 2.7 cm/m2.

They complain of weakness, shortness of breath, cough, nocturnal dyspnoea, and pulse. Examination reveals\u2014tachycardia, arrhythmia, peripheral edema, and pulmonary rales. Pregnancy is poorly tolerated in women with dilated cardiomyopathy. MANAGEMENT: The treatment is bed rest, digoxin, diuretics (preload reduction), hydralazine or ACE inhibitors (postpartum) (afterload reduction), beta blocker, and anticoagulant therapy. Vaginal delivery is preferred. Epidural anesthesia is ideal. There is no contraindication to breastfeeding. Mortality is high (20\u201350 percent)\u2014due to CCF, arrhythmia, or thromboembolism.

Position : The patient should be in a lateral recumbent position to minimize aortocaval compression Oxygen is to be administered (5\u20136 L/min) if required Analgesia, in the majority, is best given by epidural Prophylactic antibiotics against bacterial endocarditis Careful watch of the pulse and respiration rate. If the pulse rate exceeds 110 per minute between uterine contractions, rapid digitalization is done by intravenous digoxin 0.5 mg. Cardiac monitoring and pulse oximetry can detect arrhythmias and hypoxemia early. Central venous pressure monitoring may be needed in selected cases. Prophylactic antibiotics for bacterial endocarditis: Antibiotic prophylaxis during labor and 48 hours after delivery is appropriate. This is to prevent bacterial endocarditis. The recommended regimens include intravenous ampicillin 2 g and gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 80 mg) at the onset or induction of labor, followed by repeat doses 8 hours interval. High-risk patients are (a) Structural heart disease, (b) Rheumatic heart disease, (c) Cyanotic congenital heart disease, (d) Presence of dental and respiratory tract infections, (e) Hypertrophic cardiac myopathy (f) Prosthetic heart valves (g) Prior history of infective endocarditis (h) Cardiac transplant. Option: D&C. Second stage : No maternal pushing and the tendency to delay in the second stage of labor is to be curtailed by forceps or ventouse under pudendal and perineal block anesthesia. Ventouse is preferable to forceps as it can be applied without putting the patient in a lithotomy position (raising the legs increases the cardiac load). Intravenous ergometrine with the delivery of the anterior shoulder should be withheld to prevent sudden overloading of the heart by the additional blood squeezed out from the uterus. Third stage : Conventional management is to be followed. Slight blood loss is not detrimental, but if it is in excess, oxytocin can be given by infusion. This may be accompanied by aggressive diuresis by IV furosemide. It is better to administer oxytocin instead of ergometrine in all cases of heart disease in the third stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Heart Diseases in which Termination of Pregnancy is Advised: Marfan syndrome with aorta involvement (>45 mm) Coarctation of aorta Eiser Menger syndrome Any heart disease which belongs to NYHA class 4 or class 3 WHA class 4 or class 3 class com Ejection fraction < 40% Severe mitral stenosis or severe symptomatic aortic stenosis Previous peripartum cardiomyopathy with any residual impairment of LV function.</p>\n<p></p>",

Warfarin is safe for the mother but can result in warfarin embryopathy of the fetus, miscarriage, IUGR, and stillbirths. Heparin is safe for the fetus as it does not cross the placenta but is less effective than warfarin in preventing thromboembolic events.

The patient taking warfarin should discontinue it (see p. 510) as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed and replace it with heparin 5,000 units twice daily subcutaneously up to the 12th week. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) can also be used. This is then replaced by warfarin tablet 3 mg. daily to be taken simultaneously each day and continued up to 36 weeks. After that, it is replaced by heparin up to 7 days postpartum. Warfarin is then to be continued.
