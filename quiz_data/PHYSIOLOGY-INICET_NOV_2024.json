      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>2 Among the given options, the correct statement is that the enteric nervous system functions independent of the brain and spinal cord and this is the reason it is called the mini brain of the gut.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Enteric nervous system includes myenteric plexus (lie between longitudinal and circular layers of intestinal smooth muscle) and submucosal nerve plexus. The neurons of these plexuses are small interneurons that connect afferent neurons and efferent neurons to smooth muscles, secretory cells and epithelial cells , and they form the anatomical basis of local GI reflexes. Therefore, the reflex arc for local GI reflexes is located within the GI tract. Hence, ENS is capable of coordinating GI activity in the absence of external innervation. Many afferent sensory nerve fibers innervate the gut. Some of the nerve fibers have their cell bodies in the enteric nervous system, and some have them in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord They are not exclusively under influence of nerves, but also under control of hormones Parasympathetic and sympathetic connects enteric nervous system to Autonomic nervous system</p>\n<p></p>",

The joint pain accounts for the term \u201cbends\u201d that is often applied In 5% to 10% of people, nervous system symptoms occur, ranging from dizziness in about 5% to paralysis or collapse and unconsciousness in as many as 3%. The paralysis may be temporary, but in some cases, damage is permanent About 2% of people experience \u201cthe chokes,\u201d caused by massive numbers of microbubbles plugging the capillaries of the lungs. This condition is characterized by serious shortness of breath, often followed by severe pulmonary edema and, occasionally, death It is prevented by gradual ascent to sea level and the reduction pressure should not exceed 50% Treatment As soon as symptoms develop, subject is recompressed immediately in pressurized cabin Quick recompression should be followed by slow decompression Hyperbaric oxygen is helpful</p>\n<p></p>",

Type of Hb: The \u03b3 chains of fetal Hb have less avidity for 2,3-DPG than \u03b2 chains of adult Hb. Therefore, fetal Hb has higher oxygen affinity. This provides an advantage to the fetus to extract oxygen from maternal blood in the placenta . Fetal Hb shifts Oxy-Hb dissociation curve to left Hormones: Growth hormone, thyroxine and testosterone stimulate the synthesis of 2,3-DPG . Altitude: At high altitude, 2,3-DPG concentration increases substantially in red cells. This increases the availability of oxygen to the tissues. PO2: Hypoxia increases 2,3-DPG production . Procedure of storage of blood: The 2,3-DPG concentration in red cells of blood stored in the blood bank decreases. Therefore, transfusion of stored blood decreases oxygen transport, especially when transfused into hypoxic patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Oxygen Dissociation Curve: Factors Shifting Curve To Right: Increases P 50 ( decreased affinity of Hb for oxygen) that facilitates oxygen release Increased temperature Decreased pH Increased pCO 2 Increased 2,3-dpg Hypoxia Factors Shifting Curve To Left: Decreases P 50 ( increases affinity of Hb for oxygen ) that facilitates oxygen uptake and prevents oxygen release Decreased temperature Increased pH Decreased PCO 2 Fetal Hb Carbon monoxide</p>\n<p></p>",
