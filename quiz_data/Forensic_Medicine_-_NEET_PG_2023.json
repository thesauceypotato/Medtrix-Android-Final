Acid phosphatase test - Secreted by prostate (prostatic epithelial cells) Activity of Acid phosphatase test in human semen is 500 \u2013 1000 times greater than in any other body fluid. Normal acid phosphatase test activity in human semen is 340 \u2013 360 Bodansky units per ml of semen. Concentration > 100 Bodansky units indicates that ejaculation occurred within 12 hours of examination Positive reactions are found up-to 36 hrs after ejaculation in vaginal secretions. Acid phosphatase test \u2013 conclusive test in the absence of demonstrable sperm b. Barberio\u2019s Test- Test / reaction depends on presence of spermine which comes from prostate Reaction gives a yellow, needle shaped, rhombic crystal of spermine picrate. C. Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Test - CPK \u2013 found both in spermatozoa and seminal ,plasma Normal seminal fluid contains , 385 -1400 units of CPK per ml Levels > 400 units are diagnostic of seminal stains The enzyme is stable and can be demonstrated in old stains of 6 months. d. Florence Test - Tests depend on the presence of choline in semen which comes from seminal vesicles. Choline is responsible for bluish \u2013 white fluorescence of seminal stains under UV light. Positive test gives dark brown, rhombic or needle shaped crystals of choline iodide, which resemble hemin crystals. This test is not specific for semen, as several substances of animal and vegetable origin give positive results. e. Prostate specific Antigen - PSA/ P30 - A glycoprotein produced by prostatic epithelial cells Detection of PSA \u2013 reliable indicator of semen Useful indicator in Azoospermia Microscopic Examination : The only absolute proof of semen is the microscope detection of at least one unbroken sperm. Complete sperms are seen up-to 26 hrs in vagina, in the living, after ejaculation. After 26 hrs, they separate into head and tail. Similarly, after death complete sperms may be found up-to 2 days in vagina and up-to one week in the cervix & uterus.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A.Teichmann's test -will show brown,rhombic crystal. Option C.Takayama test -will show Pink, feathery appearance. Option D.Florence test- will show Brown, Rhombic crystal ,bigger compared to Teichmann\u2019s test.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Red stain: Luminol spray test (high sensitivity)- test of choice Spectroscopy (high specificity)- Most reliable test White stain: UV light Gold standard: presence of intact sperm under microscope (stain-christmas tree).
