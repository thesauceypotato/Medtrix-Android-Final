During the examination, he noted the absence of hymenal rupture, which raised questions about the assessment's findings among the para clinical staff. The forensic expert, called upon to provide clarity, emphasized a key anatomical feature of the hymen in prepubertal children that might explain the lack of expected trauma signs. What is the primary reason the hymen in children might not show rupture in suspected cases of sexual assault?",
