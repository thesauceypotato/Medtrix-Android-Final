Intradermal Injection: A shallow injection given between the layers of the skin, creating a \"weal\" on the skin. Steps for administering the intradermal injection Assemble equipment and check physicians older. Explain procedure to patient Perform hand wash and use disposable gloves. If necessary, withdraw medication from the ampoule or vial. Select an area on the inner aspect of the forearm that is not heavily pigmented or covered with hair. The upper chest or upper back beneath the scapulae are also sites for intradermal injections. Cleanse the area with an alcohol swab by wiping with a firm circular motion and moving outward from the injection site. Allow skin to dry. Use your non-dominant hand to pull skin taut over the injection site. Remove needle cap with non-dominant hand by pulling it straight off. Place the needle almost flat against the patient\u2019s skin, bevel side up. Insert the needle so that the point of the needle can be seen through the skin--only about 1/8 of an inch. Slowly inject agent while watching for a small wheal or buster to appear. If none appears, withdraw the needle slightly. Withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted. Do not massage the area after removing the needle. Do not recap the used needle. Discard the needle and syringe in the appropriate receptacle. Assist the patient into a position of comfort. Remove your gloves and dispose them properly. Perform hand hygiene. Chart the  administration  of medication,  as  well  as  the  site  of  the administration.  Some agencies recommend circling the injection site with ink. Observe the area for signs of reaction at ordered intervals.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options A, B and C are false.</p>\n<p></p>",

Intradermal Injection: A shallow injection given between the layers of the skin, creating a \"weal\" on the skin. Steps for administering the intradermal injection Assemble equipment and check physicians older. Explain procedure to patient Perform hand wash and use disposable gloves. If necessary, withdraw medication from the ampoule or vial. Select an area on the inner aspect of the forearm that is not heavily pigmented or covered with hair. The upper chest or upper back beneath the scapulae are also sites for intradermal injections. Cleanse the area with an alcohol swab by wiping with a firm circular motion and moving outward from the injection site. Allow skin to dry. Use your non-dominant hand to pull skin taut over the injection site. Remove needle cap with non-dominant hand by pulling it straight off. Place the needle almost flat against the patient\u2019s skin, bevel side up. Insert the needle so that the point of the needle can be seen through the skin--only about 1/8 of an inch. Slowly inject agent while watching for a small wheal or buster to appear. If none appears, withdraw the needle slightly. Withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted. Do not massage the area after removing the needle. Do not recap the used needle. Discard the needle and syringe in the appropriate receptacle. Assist the patient into a position of comfort. Remove your gloves and dispose them properly. Perform hand hygiene. Chart the  administration  of medication,  as  well  as  the  site  of  the administration.  Some agencies recommend circling the injection site with ink. Observe the area for signs of reaction at ordered intervals.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options A, B and C are false.</p>\n<p></p>",
