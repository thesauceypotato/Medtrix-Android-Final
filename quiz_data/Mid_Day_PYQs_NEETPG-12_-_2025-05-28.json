D) Patients with Abductor Type Dysphonia have a strained and strangled voice.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 This statement is incorrect because patients with Abductor Type Dysphonia actually present with a breathy voice or breathy breaks in voice, not a strained and strangled voice. The strained or strangled voice quality with phonation interruptions and voice breaks is characteristic of Adductor Dysphonia, where the adductor muscles of the larynx go into spasm causing vocal cords to adduct excessively.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. It is a dystonia of the laryngeal muscles. This is true. Spasmodic dysphonia involves abnormal muscular contractions (spasms) of the laryngeal muscles during speech. The condition can involve either adductor or abductor muscles, causing different voice patterns.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. It is a dystonia of the laryngeal muscles.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Standard treatment is with injection of Botulinum Toxin. This is true. Botulinum toxin injections are the standard treatment for both adductor and abductor spasmodic dysphonia. In adductor type, injections target the thyroarytenoid muscle, while in abductor type, the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles are injected.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Standard treatment is with injection of Botulinum Toxin.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Multiple injections of Botulinum toxin are required. This is true. The benefit of botulinum toxin injections typically lasts only up to 16 weeks, after which repeat injections are needed. This makes it a recurring treatment rather than a one-time solution.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Multiple injections of Botulinum toxin are required.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Adductor and Abductor spasmodic dysphonias present with distinctly different voice qualities - strained/strangled in adductor type versus breathy in abductor type - though both are treated with botulinum toxin injections that require periodic repetition due to their temporary effect.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
