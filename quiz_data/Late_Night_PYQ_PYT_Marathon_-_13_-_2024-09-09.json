A) Increase coronary blood flow by dilating the epicardial coronary arteries</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Nitrates, such as isosorbide mononitrate, act as potent vasodilators by releasing nitric oxide, which relaxes vascular smooth muscle. In Prinzmetal angina, the primary pathology is a transient spasm of the coronary arteries, which reduces blood flow to the heart muscle. Nitrates directly counter this by dilating the epicardial coronary arteries, thereby increasing blood flow, enhancing oxygen delivery to the myocardium, and alleviating chest pain. This direct vasodilatory effect is the cornerstone of symptom relief in patients with Prinzmetal angina.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Reduce heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand : Nitrates can reduce myocardial oxygen demand modestly due to their effect on venodilation, which decreases preload. However, this is not their primary mechanism of action in Prinzmetal angina, where coronary vasodilation is the key therapeutic effect.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Reduce heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Block calcium channels to prevent coronary artery spasm : This mechanism pertains to calcium channel blockers, which also treat Prinzmetal angina by preventing smooth muscle contraction in the coronary arteries. Nitrates, however, do not block calcium channels but rather promote smooth muscle relaxation through nitric oxide.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Block calcium channels to prevent coronary artery spasm</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Inhibit platelet aggregation within coronary arteries : Antiplatelet agents like aspirin and clopidogrel act through this mechanism, but nitrates do not have a significant effect on platelet aggregation. Their primary action is vasodilation rather than directly influencing platelet function.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Inhibit platelet aggregation within coronary arteries</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Nitrates, such as isosorbide mononitrate, alleviate Prinzmetal angina by dilating the coronary arteries, countering arterial spasm, and increasing myocardial blood flow.

This rash is typically non-itchy, appears a few days after starting the medication, and is not usually indicative of a true allergic reaction but rather a drug-related hypersensitivity reaction.

SSIs can range from mild to severe and can affect the skin and underlying tissues, including muscles and organs. These infections are a common complication of surgery and can lead to various health problems if not treated promptly.</li><li>\u27a4 Key characteristics and considerations related to surgical site infections (SSIs) include:</li><li>\u27a4 Classification: SSIs are classified into three main categories based on the timing of onset: Superficial Incisional SSI: Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation and involves only the skin and subcutaneous tissues at the incision site. Deep Incisional SSI: Infection also occurs within 30 days after the operation but involves deeper tissues, such as muscles and fascia, at the incision site. Organ/Space SSI: Infection can occur within 30 or 90 days after the operation and affects any part of the body other than the incision area. This can include infections within the abdominal or chest cavities. Signs and Symptoms: The symptoms of an SSI may include redness, warmth, swelling, pain, and discharge at or near the surgical site. Systemic symptoms like fever, chills, and malaise can also occur if the infection is severe or has spread. Prevention: Preventive measures are crucial in reducing the risk of SSIs. These measures include: Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis Proper hand hygiene and sterile techniques during surgery Maintaining a clean surgical environment Adequate skin preparation before incision Proper wound care and postoperative monitoring Treatment: Treatment of an SSI typically involves antibiotics to target the specific bacteria causing the infection. In some cases, additional interventions may be necessary, such as wound drainage, debridement (removal of infected tissue), or, rarely, reoperation. Complications: If left untreated or not managed appropriately, SSIs can lead to more serious complications, such as abscess formation, cellulitis, tissue necrosis, and the spread of infection to other parts of the body.</li><li>\u27a4 Classification: SSIs are classified into three main categories based on the timing of onset: Superficial Incisional SSI: Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation and involves only the skin and subcutaneous tissues at the incision site.
