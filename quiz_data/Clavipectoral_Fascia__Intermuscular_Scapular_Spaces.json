Greater Trochanter Traction epiphysis: The regions of the long bone which are non-articular, i.e. not involved in joint formation. Examples of traction epiphyses are tubercles of the humerus ( greater tubercle and lesser tubercle), and trochanters of the femur (greater and lesser). Option: B. Head of the femur Pressure epiphysis : The region of the long bone that forms the joint is a pressure epiphysis (for example- the head of the femur, part of the hip joint complex). Pressure epiphysis assists in transmitting the weight of the human body and is th e region of the bone tha t is under pressure during movement or locomotion. Another example of a pressure epiphysis is the head of the humerus which is part of the shoulder complex. condyles of the femur and tibia also come under the pressure of epiphysis. Option: C. Upper end of radius The upper end of the radius also forms the elbow joint so it is another example of pressure epiphysis.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is attached, above, to the upper and posterior border of the articular surface of the clavicle; below, to the cartilage of the first rib, near its junction with the sternum; and by its circumference to the interclavicular and anterior and posterior sternoclavicular ligaments. It is thicker at the circumference, especially its upper and back parts than at its center.
