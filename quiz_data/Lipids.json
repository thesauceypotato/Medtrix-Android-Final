      "text": "A 26-year-old male is rushed to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital in India after being bitten by a snake while working in the fields. He has no significant medical history. On examination, he is anxious, with a bite mark visible on his lower right leg. Within hours, he develops hematuria and laboratory tests indicate a rapid deterioration in renal function. The medical team considers the type of enzyme present in the snake venom that might be responsible for these clinical findings. Which enzyme in snake venom is known to cause hematuria and renal function deterioration?",
