The effect of progestin on cervical mucus makes it thick and relatively impenetrable to bacteria. Since uterine bleeding is greatly decreased in users of the LNG-IUD (progestin-releasing IUD), any retrograde menstruation (which might seed the fallopian tubes with bacteria) should be reduced as well. Plus decidual changes in the endometrium may make it less susceptible to infection. In other words, progestin-releasing IUDs may mimic the protective effect of combined oral contraceptives and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate against upper-genital-tract infection. PID is common in non-hormonal IUCD-related bacterial infections are due to contamination of the endometrial cavity at the time of insertion . Actinomycosis infection is related to IUCD use.

It contains a very low dose of progestin in any one of the following form-Levonorgestrel 75 \u00b5g, norethisterone 350 \u00b5g, desogestrel 75 \u00b5g, lynestrenol 500 \u00b5g or norgestrel 30 ug. It has to be taken daily from the first day of the cycle. Mechanism of action: It works mainly by making cervical mucus thick and viscous, thereby preventing sperm penetration. The endometrium becomes atrophic, so blastocyst implantation is also hindered. In about 2 percent of cases, ovulation is inhibited and 50 percent women ovulate normally. How to prescribe a mini pill: The first pill has to be taken on the first day of the cycle and then continuously. It has to be taken regularly and at the same time of the day. There must be no break between the packs. Delay in intake for more than 3 hours, the woman should have missed the pill immediately and the next one as scheduled. Extra precaution has to be taken for the next 2 days (see above). Advantages: Side effects attributed to estrogen in the combined pill are totally eliminated No adverse effect on lactation and hence can be suitably prescribed in lactating women and as such it is often called a \"Lactation Pill\" Easy to take as there is no \"On and Off\" regime It may be prescribed in patients having (medical disorders) hypertension, fibroid, diabetes, epilepsy, smoking, and a history of thromboembolism Reduces the risk of PID and endometrial cancer. Disadvantages: There may be acne, mastalgia, headache, breakthrough bleeding, or at times amenorrhea in about 20-30 percent of cases All the side effects, attributed to progestins may be evident Simple cysts of the ovary may be seen, but they do not require any surgery The failure rate is about Contraindications: Pregnancy unexplained vaginal bleeding recent breast cancer arterial disease. thromboembolic disease.

Women who have abnormalities of the uterus like bicornuate uterus are not good candidates for IUD insertion. Immunosuppressed individuals should not use IUCD. Patients at risk for endocarditis should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics at the insertion and removal of IUCD.

When IUCD enters the abdominal cavity (partly or completely), laparoscopy is the preferred modality for retrieval. Sometimes due to dense adhesions around the Cu T, a laparotomy may be required to remove it.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>INDICATION FOR REMOVAL OF IUCD : Indications for removal: Persistent excessive regular or irregular uterine bleeding Flaring up of salpingitis Perforation of the uterus IUD has come out of place (partial expulsion) Pregnancy occurring with the device in situ Woman desirous of a baby Missing thread One year after menopause When the effective lifespan of the device is over. IUD removal is simple and can be done at any time. It is done by pulling the strings gently and slowly with forceps. METHOD OF REMOVAL OF IUD: Device inside the uterine cavity: It can be removed by any of the following methods mentioned below: (i) Especially designed blunt hook (Fig. 37.41). (ii) Artery forceps (Fig. 37.28) (iii) Uterine curette (Fig. 37.13) (iv) Hysteroscopically under direct vision (Fig. 29.6).

When Cu T is embedded within the uterine cavity , hysteroscopic removal is the method of choice. It is preferred over the IUCD hook. Hysteroscopy cannot visualize the Cu T that is in the abdominal cavity. Option: B. Copper in the abdominal cavity can cause an inflammatory reaction and can cause intestinal obstruction . Therefore it is necessary to remove it Option: C. IS NOT preferred method.</p>\n<p></p>",

Barrier and Natural methods have a high failure rate. Option C: Lactation Amenorrhea Method (LAM) Excessive secretion of prolactin, which controls lactation, inhibits the pituitary. Prolactin inhibits luteinizing hormone (LH) but has no effect on follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). However, it partially inhibits ovarian response to both of these gonadotropins. As a result, while the prolactin level remains high, the ovary produces little estrogen and no progesterone. Hence, ovulation and menstruation are affected. LAM is e ffective only till 6 months postpartum . Beyond this, it is not a reliable method. Even for 6 months, it is effective only if there is exclusive breastfeeding. If at any time in the first 6 months the menses starts, then it cannot be used as birth control.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Suited ideally for- Lactating women Sickle cell anemia (best contraceptive) Seizure disorder (raises seizure threshold)</p>\n<p></p>",
