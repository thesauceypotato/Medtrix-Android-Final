      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Conventional HSG Hysterosalpingography (HSG): Visualization of the uterine cavity and the fallopian tubes should be carried out by screen- ing with the use of an image intensifier in an X-ray room using a Foley catheter, Rubin cannula or Leech-Wilkinson cannula for insufflation. The investigation is performed between the end of the menstrual period and ovulation (usually the ninth or tenth day of the cycle). After thoroughly cleaning the lower genital tract and with full aseptic precautions, a radiopaque dye is injected through the cannula into the uterine cavity under direct vision with a fluoroscopic screen; 15 mL of the medium is usually adequate to visualize the uterine cavity and the tubes. If the tubes are patent, the medium will be seen to spill out of the abdominal ostia and smear the adjacent bowel. A hydrosalpinx will show as a large confined mass of dye without peritoneal spill. If either tube is blocked, the site will be shown. At any stage of examination, radiographic pictures are taken for permanent record of the result.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>A viscous water-soluble solution, 50% iodine with 6% polyvinyl alcohol in water, is the medium usually employed for HSG. It is rapidly absorbed, and the risk of tissue reaction and adhesion formation in the pelvis is minimal; even when intravasated into the uterine venous system, it is harmless. Although an oil- soluble medium gives a sharper and clearer picture and may have improved therapeutic effect, it is not preferred because of the occurrence of oil granuloma, peritoneal reaction, formation of pelvic adhesions and the need for a delayed film to be taken for detecting peritoneal spill. Besides, it causes pain. The pregnancy rate is slightly better than that with water-soluble dye. Blockage of tube may be due to fibrotic block (stricture), spasms or inspissated amorphous material plugging the lumen. Bilateral cornual block with extravasation of the dye is highly suggestive of tubercular salpingitis. Apart from tubal anatomy, this examination excludes congenital abnormalities of the uterus, such as uterus bicornis, arcuate, septate uterus and fibroids.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option A.

USG HSG; Option A, B, D are incorrect as image shown in question is Conventional HSG</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>HSG has the advantage that it gives a permanent record and shows the site of tubal blockage. Among its complications are (i) pelvic infection, (ii) pain and collapse which can however be avoided by injecting atropine half an hour before the procedure and (iii) allergic reaction. HSG should not be performed (i) in the postovulatory period, (ii) in the presence of genital infection and suspected genital tuberculosis and (iii) if the patient is sensitive to iodine. HSG yields 25\u201330% salvage value and this enhancement of fertility is attributed to flushing and dislodgement of amorphous material that sometimes blocks its lumen. The amorphous material is an aggregate of histiocytes.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

They have a bimodal distribution, occurring predominantly in children but also between the ages of 55 and 65 years. They present with headaches, visual impairment, and impaired growth in children and hypopituitarism in adults. Craniopharyngiomas may be calcified and are usually hypodense, whereas gliomas are hyperdense on T2-weighted images.

Pineal tumor; Tumours can also start in the supporting cells (glial cells) in or around the pineal gland. These are called gliomas. The most common type of pineal region tumour is a type of germ cell tumour called germinoma. Option D. Torus tubarius; The torus tubarius (or torus of the auditory tube) is an elevation of the mucous membrane of the nasal part of the pharynx formed by the underlying base of the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube (auditory tube).

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Brachytherapy Clinical applications of radiotherapy in cancer of the cervix: Primary radiation therapy for cancer of the cervix combines teletherapy with brachytherapy. Radiation, like surgery, is a local therapy. It therefore influences only the tumor cells falling within the radiation volume. Intracavitary radiation by itself may therefore not be curative for patients in whom the tumor spread involves tissues beyond the effective radiation range and those with distant metastases. Additional external supplementary radiation to the pelvis is required to treat the pelvic lymph nodes. The tolerance of the normal tissues within the pelvis acts as the limiting factor in planning radiation therapy. Cervical cancer requires a radiation dose of 6000 cGy. The tolerance dose of irradiation for the urinary bladder is about 6000 cGy and for the rectum, it is about 5000 cGy. Doses in excess can damage these hollow viscera and cause radiation fistulae.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The intracavitary radiation source is so calculated that it does not deliver a dose in excess of 8000 cGy to the point A located 2.0 cm above and lateral to the external cervical os. This point denotes the point of crossing of the ureter in the pelvis. The second point of consideration is point B located 5.0 cm laterally on the pelvic sidewalls where the obturator gland is located. The radiation dose at point B should not exceed 4500 cGy. This is to safeguard the bladder and rectum from over-irradiation. Preoperative brachytherapy is used in barrel-shaped endocervical growth of more than 2 cm. This is followed within a week or 4 weeks later by Wertheim\u2019s hysterectomy. Cisplatin prior to or during brachytherapy improves the response rate. Cisplatin acts as a radiosensitizer and is employed as a neoadjuvant or concomitant chemoradiation. The renal functions have to be checked. Cisplatin 40 mg/m 2 IV given within   1 hour prior to radiotherapy weekly improves the response rate of the latter. Other radiosensitizers are 5-FU, gemcitabine and Taxol, carboplastin. Postoperative external radiotherapy is required when the surgery has been incomplete or lymph nodes prove positive for malignancy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B. Photons Option C. Protons Option D. X-rays Primary radiation therapy for cancer of the cervix combines teletherapy with brachytherapy. Hence Option B, C, D are incorrect.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Primary radiotherapy is mainly applied in advanced cancer of the cervix, but also preferred in Stages I and IIA by some  gynaecologists, alternative to Wertheim\u2019s hysterectomy. The cure rates achieved in early stages are comparable by either method. However, realizing that radiotherapy causes vaginal stenosis leading to dyspareunia, ovarian destruction with menopausal symptoms, and osteoporosis and cervical stenosis causing pyometra, the choice of treatment in young women is Wertheim\u2019s hysterectomy. In a few cases, radiotherapy fails to irradiate the pelvic nodes completely, and recurrence occurs. In such cases, surgery is preferable to repeat radiotherapy, provided the woman is surgically fit. In primary radiotherapy normally, brachytherapy is applied first followed by external teletherapy. If the growth is large, first teletherapy is applied to shrink the tumor followed by brachy- therapy. In endocervical cancer, the best survival is seen when the concomitant cisplatin weekly and weekly pelvic radiotherapy for 6 weeks is followed by surgery. Postoperative radiotherapy is required if pelvic lymph nodes prove positive for cancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Vein of Galen malformation Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations (VGAMs) , termed as median prosencephalic arteriovenous fistulas , are uncommon intracranial anomalies that tend to present dramatically during early childhood with features of a left-to-right shunt and high-output cardiac failure. Pathology: The anomaly is actually due to a cerebral arteriovenous fistula of the median prosencephalic vein (MPV) (a precursor of the vein of Galen) occurring at 6\u201311 weeks\u2019 gestation and not a malformation. The MPV fails to regress and becomes aneurysmal. It drains via the straight sinus (present only in 50%) or a persistent falcine sinus, and the vein of Galen does not form.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Radiographic features: Antenatal ultrasound: The dilated median prosencephalic vein (MPV) appears as an anechoic structure in the midline posteriorly and demonstrates prominent flow on Doppler examination. CT and MRI: Both CT and MRI can be used to delineate the malformation cross-sectionally. CT angiography: CTA in neonates with high output cardiac failure is technically-challenging due to the small volumes of contrast and very rapid passage of contrast through the circulation. MR angiography: The dilated feeding and draining vessels appear as flow voids on T2. MRA may also be performed which would better delineate vascular anatomy. Angiography: Angiography remains the gold standard in full characterisation of the lesion. It enables to individually catheterise feeding vessels. Venous drainage is via the median prosencephalic vein (MPV), the straight sinus (if present) and then out via the transverse/sigmoid sinuses.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option A. Dandy Walker syndrome; Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM) or syndrome is a posterior fossa anomaly characterized by agenesis or hypoplasia of the vermis and cystic enlargement of the fourth ventricle causing upward displacement of tentorium and torcula. Most patients have hydrocephalus at the time of diagnosis. Option C. Arnold-Chiari malformation; Arnold-Chiari or Chiari malformations describe a group of deformities of the posterior fossa and hindbrain, which includes the cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. Option D. Cerebellar vermis malformation; The cerebellum develops in a rostro-caudal manner, with rostral regions in the midline giving rise to the vermis, and caudal regions developing into the cerebellar hemispheres.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Treatment and prognosis: Prior to endovascular intervention, the prognosis was dismal, with 100% mortality without treatment and 90% mortality following surgical attempts. Ideally, embolization is deferred until 6 months of age for choroidal VGAM and later for mural types, to allow the cavernous sinus to mature. If cardiac failure is refractory to medical management, embolisation may be performed sooner. Both venous and arterial embolisation is possible, depending on the number of feeders, and controversy persists in regards to the optimal approach. The prognosis is determined mainly by the presence or absence of cardiac failure. Thus choroidal types and those presenting in the neonatal period do poorly.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Assessment for the presence of concomitant esophageal disease is needed to help determine optimal surgical management. Treatment options include expectant medical management or surgical intervention. Much has been mentioned on nonoperative management with antibiotics, nasogastric drainage, and distal tube feeds or parental nutrition. However, nonoperative management should be the exception, and not the rule, as specific criteria need to be met for medical management of esophageal perforation. They include a limited perforation with drainage of contrast back into the esophagus, with no clinical signs of infection and no pleural effusion. Surgical principles for managing esophageal perforation include good debridement of infected tissues, two-layer repair of the mucosa, and muscularis layer with reinforcement using a pedicled intercostal flap. Different contrast agents are: Ionic: Water soluble iodide dyes like Sodium diatrizoate, Meglumine iothalamate (Conray, Urograffin, Angiograffin).

Multidetector row spiral CT acquires all chest images with \u22641 mm of resolution during a short breath hold. Sixth order branches can be visualized with resolution superior to that of conventional invasive contrast pulmonary angiography. The CT scan also provides an excellent four chamber view of the heart. RV enlargement on chest CT indicates an increased likelihood of death within the next 30 days compared with PE patients who have normal RV size. When imaging is continued below the chest to the knee, pelvic and proximal leg DVT also can be diagnosed by CT scanning.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Protons The Bragg peak is a peak on the Bragg curve which plots the energy loss of ionizing radiation during its travel through matter. For protons, \u03b1 -rays, and other ion rays, the peak occurs immediately before the particles come to rest. This is called Bragg peak, after William Henry Bragg who discovered it in 1903. When a fast charged particle moves through matter, it ionizes atoms of the material and deposits a dose along its path. A peak occurs because the interaction cross section increases as the charged particles energy decreases. Energy lost by charged particles is inversely proportional to the square of their velocity, which explains the peak occurring just before the particle comes to a complete stop.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The proton is a heavy and charged particle that gradually loses its speed as it interacts with human tissue. It is easily controlled and delivers its maximum dose at a precise depth, which is determined by the amount of energy it was given by the cyclotron (via acceleration), and can go as far as 32 cm. The proton is very fast when it enters the patient\u2019s body and deposits only a small dose on its way. The absorbed dose increases very gradually with greater depth and lower speed, suddenly rising to a peak when the proton is ultimately stopped. This is known as the Bragg peak. The behavior of the proton can be precisely determined and the beam can be directed so the Bragg peak occurs exactly within the tumor site. Immediately after this burst of energy, the proton completely stops to irradiate. Proton therapy therefore allows to target tumors inside the body, precisely localize the radiation dosage and spare the patient\u2019s healthy cells, offering a much less invasive alternative to treat cancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option A.

It supplies all derivatives of the midgut, namely (1) the lower part of the duodenum below the opening of the bile duct, (2) jejunum, (3) ileum, (4) appendix, (5) cecum, (6) the ascending colon, (7) the right two-third of the transverse colon, and (8) the lower half of the head of the pancreas. Origin and course: It arises from the front of the abdominal aorta, behind the body of the pancreas, at the level of vertebra LI, one centimeter below the celiac trunk. It runs downwards and to the right, forming a curve with its convexity towards the left.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>At its origin it lies first behind the body of the pancreas and then in front of the uncinate process. Next it crosses the third part of the duodenum, enters the root of mesentery, and runs between its two layers. It terminates in the right iliac fossa by anastomosing with a branch of the ileocolic artery. Relations: Above the root of the mesentery: (a) Anteriorly, it is related to the body of the pancreas and to the splenic vein; (b) posteriorly, to the aorta, the left renal vein, the uncinate process and the third part of the duodenum. Within the root of the mesentery : (a) It crosses the inferior vena cava, the right ureter, and the right psoas. Throughout its course it is accompanied by the superior mesenteric vein which lies on its right side. The artery is surrounded by the superior mesenteric plexus of nerves.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B. Inferior mesenteric artery Option C.
