IFN-\u03b3 is the critical mediator that enables macrophages to contain the M. tuberculosis infection . First, IFN-\u03b3 stimulates maturation of the phagolysosome in infected macrophages , exposing the bacteria to a lethal acidic, oxidizing environment. Second, IFN-\u03b3 stimulates the expression of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase , which produces NO . NO combines with other oxidants to create reactive nitrogen intermediates, which are important for killing mycobacteria . Third, IFN-\u03b3 mobilizes antimicrobial peptides ( defensins ) against the bacteria. Finally, IFN-\u03b3 stimulates autophagy , which sequesters and then destroys damaged organelles and intracellular bacteria such as M. tuberculosis. In addition to stimulating macrophages to kill mycobacteria, the Th1 response orchestrates the formation of granulomas and caseous necrosis .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

With primary tuberculosis, the source of the organism is exogenous . In most people, the primary infection is contained, but in others, primary tuberculosis is progressive. In contrast to secondary tuberculosis (an apical disease with cavitation; see later), progressive primary tuberculosis more often resembles acute bacterial pneumonia with the consolidation of the lobe, hilar adenopathy, and pleural effusion.

Because of the preexistence of hypersensitivity, the bacilli elicit a prompt and marked tissue response that tends to wall off the focus of infection . As a result, the regional lymph nodes are less prominently involved early in secondary disease than they are in primary tuberculosis. On the other hand, cavitation occurs readily in the secondary form . Indeed, cavitation is almost inevitable in neglected secondary tuberculosis , and erosion of the cavities into an airway is an important source of infection because the person now coughs sputum that contains bacteria .</p>\n<p></p>",
