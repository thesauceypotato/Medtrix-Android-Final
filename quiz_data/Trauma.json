An open pneumothorax, also known as a \"sucking chest wound,\" occurs when there is an opening in the chest wall large enough for air to pass in and out during respiration, causing the lung on the affected side to collapse. Air gets preferentially drawn through the wound instead of the trachea, on inspiration : This statement is also correct . In the case of an open pneumothorax, during inspiration, air may enter the chest cavity through the wound because it follows the path of least resistance, if wound is > 3 cm in width. This can prevent the lung from expanding properly. It requires no immediate management. Wait and watch policy is used : This statement is incorrect . An open pneumothorax is a life-threatening condition and requires immediate management to prevent further lung collapse and to re-expand the affected lung. Immediately apply a 3-way occlusive dressing over the wound : This statement is partially correct . Immediate management typically involves applying an occlusive dressing that is taped on three sides , which acts as a valve to let air out but not in . This can help prevent a tension pneumothorax, where air accumulates under pressure and can compress the heart and other vital structures. Later, a chest tube need not be inserted : This statement is incorrect . The standard treatment for an open pneumothorax usually involves inserting a chest tube to re-expand the lung and evacuate air from the pleural space .</li><li>\u2022 It is a case of open pneumothorax : This is correct .

C) There is minimal associated underlying parenchyma injury in such cases</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Option A: It is most likely an acute subdural haemorrhage. Acute subdural hemorrhage (SDH) appears on CT as a crescent-shaped, concave-convex hyperdensity that crosses suture lines but does not cross the midline because of the dural attachment at the falx cerebri . In high-velocity head trauma, acute SDH is a common finding due to the tearing of bridging veins. The patient's unconscious state since the injury and the CT appearance are consistent with acute SDH.</li><li>\u2022 Option A: It is most likely an acute subdural haemorrhage.</li><li>\u2022 Acute subdural hemorrhage</li><li>\u2022 CT as a crescent-shaped, concave-convex hyperdensity</li><li>\u2022 crosses suture lines but does not cross the midline</li><li>\u2022 dural attachment at the falx cerebri</li><li>\u2022 Option B: The source of bleeding is mostly venous The source of bleeding in acute SDH is usually venous , originating from the tearing of cortical bridging veins due to acceleration-deceleration forces during trauma.

Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and neurological deterioration are indications for urgent surgical intervention , typically a craniotomy, to evacuate the SDH. This reduces the pressure on the brain and can improve outcomes.</li><li>\u2022 Option D: When features of raised ICP and neurological deterioration are present, it requires urgent evacuation.</li><li>\u2022 Increased intracranial pressure</li><li>\u2022 neurological deterioration</li><li>\u2022 indications for urgent surgical intervention</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Acute subdural hemorrhage , a common result of high-velocity head trauma , presents with a crescent-shaped hyper-density on CT scan , usually involves significant underlying brain injury , and when accompanied by raised ICP and neurological decline, requires immediate neurosurgical evacuation.</li><li>\u27a4 Acute subdural hemorrhage</li><li>\u27a4 common result of high-velocity head trauma</li><li>\u27a4 crescent-shaped hyper-density on CT scan</li><li>\u27a4 underlying brain injury</li><li>\u27a4 Ref : Bailey and Love\u2019s Short Practice of Surgery 28th Edition Page 366-367</li><li>\u27a4 Ref</li><li>\u27a4 : Bailey and Love\u2019s Short Practice of Surgery 28th Edition Page 366-367</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
