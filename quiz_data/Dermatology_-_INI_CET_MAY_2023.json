Direct immunofluorescence linear deposition shows IgG and C3.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common autoimmune subepidermal blistering disorder Characteristically presents with tense bullae and intense generalized pruritus. Spongiosis and superficial papillary dermal infiltrate of eosinophils without vesiculation are characteristic features of urticarial lesions and direct immunofluorescence will highlight the autoantibodies against the basement membrane zone Etiology Autoantibodies against proteins arranged at the dermal-epidermal junction (Autoantibodies against 2 parts of the basal keratinocyte hemidesmosomal proteins BP antigen 230 (BPAG1) and BP antigen 180 (BPAG2 or type XVII collagen) Drug-induced bullous pemphigoid. Eg : furosemide and spironolactone, NSAIDs, amoxicillin, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, gliptins, and TNF alpha inhibitors Note : Unlike pemphigus vulgaris, the Nikolsky sign is negative in typical cases of bullous pemphigoid Treatment : Systemic corticosteroids</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - OPTION A: Pemphigus vulgaris is an intraepidermal immunobullous disease. They present with flaccid blisters. OPTION B : Pemphigus foliaceus is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the development of blisters and erosions on the skin, primarily on the upper body and face. There is lack of mucosal involvement Option D : Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic skin condition characterized by intensely itchy and blistering skin lesions. It is actually associated with an autoimmune response to gluten. A skin biopsy from a lesion near the affected area is examined to detect specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) deposits under the skin</p>\n<p></p>",
