      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Anti measles IgG in CSF Given case history and findings point to the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing pan encephalitis (SSPE). Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive neurological disorder of children and young adults that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is a slow, but persistent, viral infection caused by defective measles virus seen mostly in youngsters.  Patients with SSPE have a history of measles infection at an early age, usually younger than 2 years, followed by a latent period of 6 to 8 years before neurological symptoms begin. The initial symptoms of SSPE are subtle and include mild mental deterioration (such as memory loss) and changes in behavior (such as irritability) followed by disturbances in motor function, including uncontrollable involuntary jerking movements of the head, trunk or limbs called myoclonic jerks. Seizures may also occur. Some people may become blind. In advanced stages of the disease, individuals may lose the ability to walk, as their muscles stiffen or spasm. There is progressive deterioration to a comatose state, and then to a persistent vegetative state. Death is usually the result of fever, heart failure, or the brain's inability to continue controlling the autonomic nervous system. '</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE ) SSPE is a rare, progressive neurological disorder that occurs as a result of a delayed, persistent infection of the brain by the measles virus. It typically occurs several years after an initial measles infection. The symptoms of SSPE may include myoclonic jerks (involuntary muscle twitches), personality changes, cognitive decline, and seizures. To confirm the diagnosis of SSPE, one of the investigations that can be done is testing for anti-measles IgG antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, and testing for specific antibodies in the CSF can help identify the presence of the measles virus in the central nervous system.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A: C1Q4 ab in CSF: C1Q4 antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are associated with certain autoimmune disorders, such as neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE), but they are not indicative of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). OPTION C : HSV PCR: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is used to detect the presence of HSV DNA in the CSF and is mainly used for diagnosing herpes encephalitis , which typically presents with different symptoms than those described in the scenario.

Coarctation of the aorta causes an increase in the upper extremity blood pressure , age of presentation depends on severity The first is the neonatal presentation that is associated with left ventricular dysfunction and shock from the neonatal myocardium's intolerance of the sudden increase in afterload that occurs with closure of the ductus arteriosus. This presentation often occurs within the first one to two weeks after birth. There can be a history of poor feeding, evidence of shock with poor perfusion, gallop heard on auscultation, and a murmur of mitral regurgitation. The second presentation occurs in older children and adults. Coarctation of the aorta in this scenario results in upper extremity hypertension, leading to early coronary artery disease, aortic aneurysm, and cerebrovascular disease. In older children, a systolic murmur with diastolic continuation can be heard in the left infrascapular region. This murmur can represent blood flow across the coarctation or through dilated collaterals. A systolic ejection click and systolic ejection murmur in the left upper sternal border is a consistent exam finding with a bicuspid aortic valve</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital heart defect characterized by a narrowing of the aorta. Common symptoms include upper limb hypertension, absent pulses in the lower limbs, and cool lower extremities.

Diagnosis is made through physical examination, blood pressure measurements, echocardiography, and imaging studies.

Serum total calcium (normal: 8.0-10.2 mg%, or 2.2-2.5 mmol/L) is present in three forms, as follows: approximately 50% of the calcium is bound with plasma protein (albumin is responsible for 80%), unbound ionized calcium, and 5-10% calcium bound and chelated with plasma anions (phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, and citric acid). About half of the total calcium is ionized calcium ( normal: 4.0-4.6 mg%, or 1.0-1.5 mmol/ L) which is physiologically active. Clinically hypocalcaemia refers to a decrease in ionized calcium hence ionized calcium should be measured when hypocalcaemia is suspected. Loss of carbon dioxide due to hyperventilation drives bicarbonate to combine with hydrogen ions to form carbon dioxide. This causes a decrease in hydrogen ions leading to respiratory alkalosis. Respiratory alkalosis dissociates bound hydrogen ions from albumin, which binds with calcium thereby decreasing the freely ionized portion of total serum calcium by 0.05mmol/l for every 0.1 increase in pH. Hypocalcaemia increases neuronal excitability by decreasing the threshold potential needed to activate the sodium channel due to alteration in the electrical state of the channel protein. The hallmark of acute hypocalcaemia is neuromuscular Patients often complain of numbness and tingling in their finger tips, toes and perioral region and may present as carpopedal spasm.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Blood culture and CSF from shunt tap Given case scenario points to the diagnosis of shunt associated meningitis and hence blood culture along with shunt tap would be the most appropriate choice for this patient to obtain CSF sample. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts, which are used to treat hydrocephalus, shunt cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the lateral ventricles of the brain into the peritoneum. Tapping or aspirating the shunt is performed for both diagnostic reasons (eg, evaluate for shunt infection and blockage) and therapeutic reasons (eg, allows fluids to be drawn off to alleviate symptoms from a blocked shunt). Shunt infection is a common complication of shunt surgery. The majority of shunt infections occur within 3 months of the shunt surgery. The spectrum of clinical manifestations include the following: Wound infection : an incision or shunt tract with signs of inflammation, purulent discharge, and organisms seen on Gram stain or culture. Wound breakdown with shunt tubing exposed should be treated as a shunt infection. Meningitis : fever, meningismus, CSF leukocytosis, and organisms seen on Gram stain or culture. Peritonitis : fever, abdominal tenderness (abdominal pseudocyst and abdominal abscess may present with mass with or without fever), and organisms seen on Gram stain or culture. For vascular shunts, findings are fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood culture, with or without evidence of shunt nephritis or cor pulmonale . Infected shunt apparatus: minimal signs of CSF contamination with bacteria recovered from purulent exudate in or on shunt material, Gram stain of CSF withdrawn from the shunt, or positive culture on fluid aspirated from the shunt under sterile conditions. One of the more common and difficult clinical situations to manage is the patient with a VP shunt who has a temperature. If the child is well, other more common causes of a temperature such as a urinary tract infection and upper respiratory tract infection should be excluded. Routine blood tests may reveal a polymorphonuclear leukocytosis and a raised C-reactive protein may also be seen Culture of the urine or other obvious sites of infections, for example, the wound, should also be taken. In the absence of another source or in an unwell child, it is prudent to perform a shunt tap to diagnose whether the shunt reservoir can be performed preoperatively or by obtaining CSF intraoperatively. In most cases, CSF should be sent for cell count, Gram stain, culture and sensitivity, glucose, and protein. Shunt aspiration should be done using an aseptic technique so as not to iatrogenically contaminate a shunt system. Shunt aspiration provides a high diagnostic yield of shunt infection of approximately 95% and is quite safe. The most common organisms infecting CSF shunts are staphylococci. Approximately 40% of shunt infections are caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis infections and 20% by aureus. Other species isolated from infected shunts include the coryneforms, streptococci, enterococci, aerobic gram-negative rods, and yeasts. Propionobacteria acnes is a relatively common organism causing shunt infection but requires prolonged culture to diagnose. Because these organisms are commonly part of the normal skin flora, and shunt infection usually occurs within 2 months of surgery, endogenous spread from the patient or surgical staff is the logical route of infection. Thus, a relatively early shunt infection (i.e., within 6 months of insertion) is seen as a surgical complication. Bacteria colonize the shunt in the form of a continuous biofilm. This biofilm is composed of bacterial cells, either singly or in microcolonies, all embedded in an anionic matrix of bacterial exopolymers and trapped macromolecules. The biofilm offers protection against many common antibacterial agents and thus, treatment of shunt infections by the exclusive use of systemic or intraventricular antibiotic has been generally ineffective, except if infections with intraventricular antibiotics were injected into a separate CSF reservoir. It has been shown that shunt removal with interval antibiotic treatment (usually with EVD) carries the highest shunt infection cure rate and the lowest mortality rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Shunt-associated meningitis is an infection involving the meninges related to a ventricular shunt. It is often caused by bacterial contamination during surgery or shunt manipulation. Symptoms include fever, headache, neck stiffness, irritability, vomiting, and changes in consciousness. Diagnosis is made through CSF analysis obtained by lumbar puncture. Treatment involves intravenous antibiotics based on CSF culture results. Shunt revision is often necessary to remove the infected shunt system. Prevention includes sterile techniques during surgery, proper shunt care, and consideration of prophylactic antibiotics in high-risk cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Always remember these points or shunt tap: Strict aseptic technique is essential in this procedure, as the consequence of introducing infection is usually replacement of the whole shunt. Allow the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to drip into the tubes through the end of the needle or 3-way tap. Aspiration can result in the choroid plexus being sucked up into the shunt tip, precipitating shunt blockage. This is especially true in slit ventricles. A shunt tap should only be considered after performing a CT or MRI scan of the brain and shunt series imaging. Other common infections should also be excluded, since shunt infections are unlikely more than 3 months after placement. Manometry and documentation of the flow rate is important. ] High opening CSF pressures (>25 cm H 2 O above the level of the ventricle) are associated with distal shunt obstruction in approximately 90% of cases. Poor flow is associated with proximal shunt obstruction in over 90% of cases.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Snowman heart \u2013 TAPVC</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>In TAPVC , the pulmonary veins , which normally carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left side of the heart, connect to the right atrium or its tributaries. This abnormal connection creates a characteristic appearance on a chest X-ray, often described as a \" snowman heart. \" The \"snowman\" refers to the enlarged right atrium and the \"hat\" or upper part of the \"snowman\" represents the enlarged right ventricle.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B: Boot shaped \u2013 TOF Option C: Egg on string- TGA Option D: Cottage loaf heart, truncus arteriosus:</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>TAPVC is a congenital heart defect where the pulmonary veins don't connect properly to the left atrium. The condition causes abnormal circulation and often leads to cyanosis . On a chest X-ray, TAPVC can present as a \" snowman heart \" with an enlarged right atrium and an enlarged right ventricle. Additional imaging techniques like echocardiography or cardiac catheterization are usually required for a definitive diagnosis. Surgical correction is typically necessary to redirect the pulmonary veins and restore normal blood flow.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Heart Appearance Heart Condition Snowman heart Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection (TAPVC) Boot-shaped Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) Egg on string Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) Cottage loaf heart Truncus Arteriosus</p>\n<p></p>",
