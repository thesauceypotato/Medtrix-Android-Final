      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pectus excavatum causes respiratory problems Pectus excavatum: The sternum is depressed, with a dish-shaped deformity of the anterior portions of the ribs on one or both sides. It is never a cause of respiratory problems. It can be repaired to improve its cosmetic appearance either as an open procedure (the Ravitch procedure) which involves resecting the affected costal cartilages and mobilizing the sternum, or as a minimally invasive technique, the Nuss procedure. A metal bar is placed behind the sternum to hold this central panel in its new position and has to be removed after a period of time. Pectus carinatum (pigeon chest): In this condition the sternum is elevated above the level of the ribs and treatment is offered for cosmetic reasons. The sternum is mobilized and allowed to fall back into place. It often comes to light during the growth spurt at adolescence when, of course, the teenager is particularly sensitive about appearance. Most patients are asymptomatic and the only justification for treatment is on cosmetic grounds. Some surgeons make a very good case for this but the risk of morbidity and of a less than perfect result must be clearly spelt out to the patient and his/her parents. Surgery involves mobilizing the sternum with the costal cartilages so that the sternum can be flattened to a more anatomical position. Surgery is best left until the late teens, when further growth of the chest wall is unlikely.</p>\n<p></p>",

Rigid bronchoscopy is preferred for its therapeutic value in removal of of secretions/foreign bodies, stent placement and endobronchial resections Option 1 \u2013 Flexible bronchoscopy is preferred for diagnosis of carcinoma bronchus Option 2 \u2013 Rigid bronchoscopy is preferred for stent placement. Option 3 \u2013 Rigid bronchoscopy is also preferred for Endobronchial resection of tumors/masses Option 4 \u2013 For foreign body removal also, we prefer rigid bronchoscopy Option 5 \u2013 For diagnostic purposes, flexible bronchoscopy is preferred over rigid bronchoscopy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Flexible bronchoscopy is often done with sedation, especially for patients with centrally located lung cancers. It enables evaluation of the segmental airway and allows for cytological testing through brushing and washing of the affected segmental bronchi. Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) can also be performed during flexible bronchoscopy. General anesthesia is typically needed for rigid bronchoscopy. It's best suited for therapeutic procedures like removing foreign objects or performing surgery within the airway. The bronchoscope is inserted directly into the trachea through the oropharynx under direct visualization</p>\n<p></p>",
