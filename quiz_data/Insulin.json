      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Negative feedback In most instances, t his control is exerted through negative feedback mechanisms that ensure a proper level of hormone activity at the target tissue. After a stimulus causes the release of the hormone, conditions or products resulting from the action of the hormone tend to suppress its further release. In other words, the hormone (or one of its products) has a negative feedback effect to prevent over-secretion of the hormone or overactivity at the target tissue.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Rest options are incorrect because the hormone has a negative feedback effect to prevent over-secretion of the hormone or overactivity at the target tissue.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Positive feedback: Positive feedback is the amplification of a body's response to a stimulus. For example, in childbirth, when the head of the fetus pushes up against the cervix it stimulates a nerve impulse from the cervix to the brain.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>ATP-sensitive K+ channels Glucose acts directly on pancreatic B cells to increase insulin secretion . The response to glucose is biphasic; there is a rapid but short-lived increase in the secretion followed by a more slowly developing prolonged increase. Glucose enters the B cells via GLUT 2 transporters and is phosphorylated by glucokinase then metabolized to pyruvate in the cytoplasm. The pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is metabolized to CO2 and H2O via the citric acid cycle with the formation of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. The ATP enters the cytoplasm, where it inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ channels, reducing K+ efflux. This depolarizes the B cell, and Ca2+ enters the cell via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The Ca2+ influx causes exocytosis of a readily releasable pool of insulin-containing secretory granules, producing the initial spike of insulin secretion.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Insulin acts on the Tyrosine kinase Receptors.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Insulin receptors are decreased during starvation Both insulin and glucagon function as important feedback control systems for maintaining a normal blood glucose concentration. When the glucose concentration rises too high, increased insulin secretion causes blood glucose concentration to decrease toward normal . Insulin receptors are decreased in starvation: Insulin receptors are increased in starvation. Insulin receptors are increased in starvation to allow glucose entry into the cells.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Conversely, a decrease in blood glucose stimulates glucagon secretion; the glucagon then functions in the opposite direction to increase glucose toward normal. Under most normal conditions, the insulin feedback mechanism is more important than the glucagon mechanism, but in instances of starvation or excessive utilization of glucose during exercise and other stressful situations, the glucagon mechanism also becomes valuable.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. Insulin causes K+ to enter cells, decreasing K+ in ECF: That is why Insulin along with glucose is given in cases of Hyperkalemia to prevent arrhythmia. Option C. Affinity of insulin receptors is decreased in adrenal insufficiency: The release of adrenaline activates specific physiological reactions, which are intended to prepare the body to respond to the perceived stressor or threat including stimulation of the liver to break down glycogen into glucose (to provide quick energy to the body). Option D. Insulin promotes fat synthesis: insulin is a lipogenic hormone.</p>\n<p></p>",
