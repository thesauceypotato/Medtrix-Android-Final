Keywords: On X-ray \u2013 pump-mediastinum; after a heavy meal Boerhaave's syndrome is characterized by a transmural tear of the distal esophagus induced by a sudden increase in pressure. Boerhaave syndrome classically presents as the Mackler triad of chest pain, vomiting, and subcutaneous emphysema due to esophageal rupture. Ideal management for Boerhaave syndrome involves a combination of both conservative and surgical interventions. The mainstays of therapy include the following: Intravenous volume resuscitation Administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics Prompt endoscopic and surgical intervention</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Boerhaave Syndrome Spontaneous rupture usually occurs on the left posterolateral side of the distal esophagus, into the left pleural cavit y or just above the gastroesophageal junction. Typically, male patients (85%) aged between 40 to 60 years with a recent history of vomiting are affected. Clinical Features Spontaneous esophageal perforation is characterized by Mackler's triad of thoracic pain, vomiting, and cervical subcutaneous emphysema. Thoracic perforations cause substernal and epigastric pain. While mediastinal emphysema and pleural effusions are common, early cervical subcutaneous emphysema is observed in only 20% or less of patients. Increasing contamination and inflammation of the mediastinum and pleural cavities lead to fever and sepsis . Patients with an abdominal perforation experience epigastric abdominal pain, which is also frequently referred to the back and left shoulder</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The diagnosis of hydropneumothorax can be confirmed by performing a contrast esophagogram , which has a high success rate of detecting extravasation in 90% of patients. To avoid the risk of barium extravasation into the pleura or mediastinum, gastrografin (a water-soluble contrast agent) is preferred over barium. If the initial esophagogram is negative, a barium study may follow. Chest CT can also aid in diagnosis by revealing mediastinal air and fluid at the site of perforation. Endoscopy may be necessary if the esophagogram is negative or if surgery is planned. Treatment involves immediate resuscitation, securing the airway, administering intravenous fluids, and starting broad-spectrum antibiotics.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Within 24 Hours After 24 Hours optimal time for primary closure of an esophageal perforation is within the first 24 hours and inflammation is typically minimal.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Duodenum Wall of the first part of duodenum is the most common site of gastrinoma. A gastrinoma is a gastrin-secreting tumor that can occur in the pancreas. More than 70% of the gastrinomas in MEN 1 syndrome and most sporadic gastrinomas are located in the first and second part of the duodenum. More than 80% of gastrinomas arise within the \u201ctriangle of gastrinoma\u201d defined as the confluence of: The cystic and common bile duct superiorly The second and third portions of the duodenum inferiorly And the neck and body of the pancreas medially. The triad of : Non beta islet cell tumors of the pancreas (gastrinomas), hypergastrinemia, and severe ulcer disease is known as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES). Most sensitive test for the diagnosis of ZES is Fasting serum gastrin measurement. What is multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1? Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) also known as Wermer syndrome is an endocrine tumor syndrome caused by inactivating mutations of the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene at the 11q13 locus. MEN1 predisposes to the development of tumors in target neuroendocrine tissues. Type 2 MEN (MEN2), in contrast, is caused by mutations in the RET proto-oncogene and typically presents as medullary thyroid carcinoma, hyperparathyroidism, or pheochromocytoma. The most common tumors seen in MEN1 involve the : parathyroid gland, islet cells of the pancreas, and pituitary gland. Other endocrine tumors seen in MEN1 include adrenal cortical tumors, neuroendocrine tumors (previously called carcinoid tumors), and rare pheochromocytoma, as well as tumors in other parts of the digestive tract.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Gastrinoma is a non-beta islet cell tumor of the pancreas that produces excessive amounts of gastrin , leading to a condition called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES). ZES is characterized by fulminating ulcer diathesis in the stomach, duodenum, or atypical sites , recurrent ulceration despite \"adequate\" therapy, and non-beta islet cell tumors of the pancreas (gastrinoma). Gastrinoma is a rare disease, affecting between 5 and 4 in a million. Approximately 0.1% of patients with duodenal ulcers have evidence of ZES. In sporadic disease , the tumors are mostly located in the duodenum (60-80%) and are small (<5mm) and multiple . In MEN 1 , all tumors are in the The vast majority (approximately 90%) occur within the \"gastrinoma triangle.\" Diagnosis of ZES is based on an elevated fasting serum gastrin ( FSG ). If the FSG is more than 10-fold elevated, the diagnosis is confirmed. If the FSG is less than 10-fold higher, a secretin provocation test should be performed.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Localisation studies are then indicated as the tumors are often small and multiple. The majority of gastrinomas have a high density of somatotropin receptors. 68Ga-labelled SSAs with PET-CT have been found to be sensitive and specific. If not available, somatostatin scintigraphy (SRS) and EUS should be done. Chromogranin A is an unreliable test for gastrinoma. Treatment of gastrinoma involves surgery, which should be performed by an experienced surgeon. All patients with sporadic gastrinoma without metastases should have a surgical operation. In MEN 1/gastrinoma , surgery is not recommended for patients with tumors <2cm . Tumors >2cm are enucleated. Parathyroidectomy reduces gastric acid secretion.</p>\n<p></p>",

Lymphadenectomy is indicated only in high-risk patients with large primary tumours and enlarged lymph nodes. Radical nephrectomy remains the standard gold treatment for localised disease. Incidental detection of small renal masses (tumours <4 cm)nephron-sparing surgery is being performed. Partial nephrectomy should be the treatment of choice in tumours less than 4 cm, in well-selected tumours between 4 and 7 cm, in bilateral tumours, in tumours in solitary kidneys and patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction. Because of the limitation of ischaemia time, minimally invasive techniques should be reserved for tumours with non-complex anatomy, as predicted by nephelometry scores. Alternative techniques such as surveillance, cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation of small renal tumours may be offered in patients with high surgical risk (e.g. elderly patients and patients with multiple comorbidities). Active surveillance is based on the fact that most incidental tumours detected in the elderly grow slowly and have a low chance of local invasion or metastasis.

The distance that a patient is able to walk without stopping varies (claudication distance) only slightly from day to day. It is decreased, first, by increasing the work demands and hence oxygen requirements of the muscles affected, e.g. walking uphill, increasing the speed of walking and/or carrying heavy weights, and, second, by general health conditions that reduce the oxygen delivery capacity of the arterial system, e.g. anemia or cardiorespiratory disease.

Zenker diverticulum is a pulsion diverticulum of the hypopharynx, usually seen in elderly people. Zenker diverticula are lined with stratified squamous epithelium with a thin lamina propria. No muscular layer exists. The pathologic process in Zenker diverticulum involves herniation of the esophageal mucosa posteriorly between the cricopharyngeus (CP) muscle and the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscles. Therefore a Zenker diverticulum is a false diverticulum. The retention of food elements and secretions within the lesion\u2019s pouch frequently leads to halitosis, regurgitation, aspiration, and dysphagia in patient. Aspiration & pneumonitis are the most common complications.

These abnormalities cause a functional obstruction at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) leading to above described signs and symptoms. Specific tests for achalasia are barium swallow and esophageal manometry. The barium swallow shows classical Bird beak appearance. Treatment options include: Sublingual nifedipine / nitrates Pneumatic dilation Botox injection Surgical myomectomy Diffuse esophageal spasm Carcinoma esophagus</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Achalasia Cardia It is the most common hypomotility disorder of the esophagus . Achalasia refers to the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax . Both the muscle of the esophagus and LES are affected. The prevailing theory suggests that destruction of the nerves to LES is the primary pathology, and degeneration of neuromuscular function of the body of the esophagus is secondary. It is a premalignant condition that may lead to squamous cell carcinoma. Achalasia can be seen in Triple A syndrome or Allgrove disease , which involves Achalasia, Alacrima, and ACTH-resistant Adrenal insufficiency . It is caused by progressive inflammation and selective loss of inhibitory myenteric neurons in Auerbach\u2019s plexus of the esophagus that normally secrete VIP and nitric oxide . This results in the failure of relaxation of LES and aperistalsis of the esophageal body, leading to functional obstruction at the level of the GE junction and gradual dilatation of the esophagus. The classic triad of symptoms includes dysphagia , regurgitation , and weight loss . Other symptoms commonly seen are heartburn, postprandial choking, and nocturnal coughing.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Treatment options for Achalasia Cardia : Early stage : Sublingual nitroglycerin, nitrates, or calcium channel blockers can provide temporary relief of chest pressure before or after a meal. Bougie dilation up to 54 French may offer several months of relief but requires repeated dilations to be sustainable. Botulinum toxin injection directly into the LES can relax the LES and provide symptomatic relief for years, but symptoms may recur more than 50% of the time within 6 months. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy is the preferred surgical option , where the extent of myotomy is 2 cm above GE junction to 1 cm below, over the stomach. Partial antireflux procedure (Toupet or Dor fundoplication) can be performed to restore a barrier to reflux and decrease postoperative symptoms. Esophagectomy may be considered for megaesophagus, sigmoid esophagus, failure of more than one myotomy, or an undilatable reflux stricture .</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Seen in chronic lymphoedema Edema in the dorsum of the foot is frequently described as a buffalo hump. Lymphedema is an accumulation of protein and fluid in the subcutaneous tissue that results from impaired transport of protein-rich lymphatic fluid from the interstitium. Inability to pick up the skin of the base of the toes is called a positive stemmer sign There are 4 stages of lymphedema: Stage 0 - subclinical lymphedema Stage 1 - early accumulation of fluid that is high in protein content, swelling may subside with limb elevation, and pitting of the skin may occur Stage 2 - pitting may not occur as tissue fibrosis develops, and limb elevation alone does not reduce swelling Stage 3 - a severe increase in limb swelling along with skin changes, including fibrosis, induration, warty overgrowths, and excess adipose tissue proliferation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Lymphoedema: Lymphoedema may be defined as abnormal limb swelling caused by the accumulation of increased amounts of high protein ISF secondary to defective lymphatic drainage in the presence of (near) normal net capillary filtration Pathology: Result of an inability of the existing lymphatic system to accommodate the protein and fluid entering the interstitial compartment at the tissue level. Stages : First Stage -  Soft pitting edema (impaired lymphatic drainage results in protein-rich fluid accumulation in the interstitial compartment) Second Stage - Nonpitting and Spongy consistency (the clinical condition is further exacerbated by the accumulation of fibroblasts, adipocytes, and, perhaps most important, macrophages in the affected tissues, which culminates in a local inflammatory response) Third Stage - Lymphostatic Elephantiasis (excessive subcutaneous fibrosis and scarring with associated severe skin change). Edema is irreversible at this stage. Aetiological classification of lymphoedema: Primary lymphoedema Congenital (onset <2 years old): sporadic; familial (Nonne\u2013Milroy\u2019s disease) Praecox (onset 2\u201335 years old): sporadic; familial (Letessier\u2013Meige\u2019s disease) Tarda (onset after 35 years old) Secondary lymphoedema A parasitic infection (filariasis) Fungal infection (tinea pedis) Exposure to foreign body material (silica particles) Primary malignancy Metastatic spread to lymph nodes Radiotherapy to lymph nodes Surgical excision of lymph nodes Trauma (particularly degloving injuries) Superficial thrombophlebitis Deep venous thrombosis. Diagnosis : Unlike other types of edema, lymphoedema characteristically involves the foot. The contour of the ankle is lost through infilling of the Sub malleolar depressions, A \u2018buffalo hump\u2019 forms on the dorsum of the foot, The toes appear \u2018square\u2019 because of the confinement of footwear and The skin on the dorsum of the toes cannot be pinched because of subcutaneous fibrosis (Stemmer\u2019s sign) . Lymphoedema usually spreads proximally to knee level & less commonly affects the whole leg. Chronic eczema, fungal infection of the skin (dermatophytosis) and nails (onychomycosis), fissuring, verrucae, and papillae (warts) are frequently seen in advanced diseases. Ulceration is unusual, except in the presence of chronic venous insufficiency Treatment: General Therapeutic Measures : Appropriate Antibiotics Maintenance of ideal body weight Elevation and Compression Garments: The ideal compression garment is custom fitted and delivers pressures in the range of 30 to 60 mm Hg. Limb Elevation at night Avoid standing for prolonged periods Complex Decongestive Physical Therapy Compression Pump Therapy (Pneumatic Compression therapy) Drug Therapy - Benzopyrones Molecular Lymphangiogenesis Operative Treatment: Reconstructive - should be considered for those patients with proximal (either primary or secondary) obstruction of the extremity lymphatic circulation with preserved, dilated lymphatics peripheral to the obstruction. Excisional - only viable option for patients without residual lymphatics of adequate size for reconstructive procedures. For patients with recalcitrant stage II and early stage III lymphedema in whom the edema is moderate and the skin is relatively healthy, an excisional procedure that removes a large segment of the lymphedematous subcutaneous tissues and the overlying skin is the procedure of choice</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B : Occurs due to parasitic infection not viral infection Option C : Not very common in children except congenital primary lymphoedema Option D : Involvement is not always bilateral</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Lymphedema is not curable, but the symptoms and long-term effects can be controlled with a combination of elastic compression stockings, limb elevation, pneumatic compression, and massage.

For paracetamol toxicity , criteria are met if arterial pH <7.30 or INR >6.5, serum creatinine 3.4 mg/dL (301 \u00b5mol/L), and grade III/IV encephalopathy are present. For non-paracetamol toxicity , criteria are met if INR >6.5 or three out of five criteria are present: age, aetiology, duration of jaundice, PT, and serum bilirubin. Lactate or phosphate thresholds may improve sensitivity and negative predictive value. Hepatic encephalopathy grades range from 1 (inverted sleep pattern, agitation) to 4 (coma).</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The grading system for hepatic encephalopathy includes four grades. Grade 1 symptoms include inverted sleep pattern, agitation, forgetfulness, irritability, and apraxia. Grade 2 symptoms include lethargy, time/place disorientation, personality change, and ataxia. Grade 3 symptoms include somnolence to semistupor, place disorientation, asterixis, and hyperactive reflexes. Grade 4 includes the symptom of coma. Lactate or phosphate thresholds added to the criteria may improve sensitivity and negative predictive value.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA King's College selection criteria for liver transplantation in acute liver failure CAUSE SELECTION CRITERIA Acetaminophen Arterial pH <7.30 irrespective of hepatic coma grade Or Prothrombin time >100 s + serum creatinine level >3.4 mg/dL + grade III or IV hepatic coma Not acetaminophen Prothrombin time >100 s irrespective of hepatic coma grade Or Any three of the following, irrespective of hepatic coma grade: Cryptogenic or drug-induced hepatitis Serum bilirubin level >17.5 mg/dL Jaundice to coma interval >7 d Prothrombin time >50 s Age <10 y or >40 y</p>\n<p></p>",
