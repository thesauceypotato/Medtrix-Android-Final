Hence, repeated dosing may be necessary. Since it is a specific antidote, therefore, the drug has no value in poisoning by other CNS depressants. The drug is also useful in hepatic coma. Since, it blocks BZDs receptors; it is the drug of choice for BZD overdose. The drug is also useful in zaleplone or zolpidem poisoning. The effect of the drug is rapid and is seen within 2-3 minutes. Starting dose is 200 microgram every 1-2 minutes and maximum dose is 3 mg/hour. It is noteworthy that the drug should not routinely be used in patients with decreased levels of consciousness in patients with poisoning by other CNS depressants. Seizures can occur if this is done.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B . It Acts on both barbiturate & benzodiazepine receptors Option: C.
