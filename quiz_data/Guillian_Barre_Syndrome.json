On physical examination, he is afebrile and has 3/5 motor strength in his extremities. A lumbar puncture is done and yields clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid under normal pressure. This fluid has a slightly elevated protein concentration, but a normal glucose level, and a cell count with only a few mononuclear cells. He recovers in three weeks. If lymphocytic infiltrates were seen in peripheral nerves along with segmental demyelination at the time he initially saw his physician, what would be the most likely diagnosis?",
