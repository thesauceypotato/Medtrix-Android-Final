Ethmoid, sphenoid and frontal sinuses and the olfactory area of the nose. Mesostructure . Maxillary sinus and the respiratory part of the nose. Infrastructure . Containing alveolar process. This classification further uses vertical lines, extending down the medial walls of the orbit to separate ethmoid sinuses and nasal fossa from the maxillary sinuses.</p>\n<p></p>",

A most common site of origin is a lateral wall of the nose in the middle meatus; less commonly it arises from the maxillary, frontal or sphenoid sinus. It is so named because hyperplastic papillomatous tissue grows into the stroma rather than in an exophytic manner. Human papillomavirus is thought to be responsible for its aetiology. Clinically, men are affected more than women in the age group of 40\u201370. It is almost always unilateral and presents with nasal obstruction, nasal discharge and epistaxis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. Inverted papilloma also called Schneiderian papilloma is a true statement. Option C. Inverted papilloma presents with epistaxis and nasal obstruction is also a true statement. Option D. Inverted papilloma arises in the Lateral nasal wall in the middle meatus rarely on the septum.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows the location and extent of the lesion. MRI also helps to differentiate associated secretions in the sinus from the actual tumour mass. A biopsy is essential for diagnosis. Treatment. Medial maxillectomy is the treatment of choice. It can be performed by lateral rhinotomy or sublabial degloving approach.</p>\n<p></p>",
