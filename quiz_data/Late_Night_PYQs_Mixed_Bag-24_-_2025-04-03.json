      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. B. Segment II is due to Laplace Law</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The true statement regarding the given cystometrogram is that segment lb is due to Laplace law.</li><li>\u2022 The law of Laplace correlates volume and wall tension, is applicable to urine storage.</li><li>\u2022 According to Law of Laplace, the pressure (P) in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension (T) divided by the radius (R). This is expressed as P= 2T/R.</li><li>\u2022 As the bladder gets filled, the radius increases along with the tension, hence there is a slight increase in pressure until the bladder is relatively full, which explains the flatness of the graph in segment II</li><li>\u2022 The first urge to void is felt at a bladder volume of about 150 mL. A marked sense of fullness is felt at a bladder volume of 400ml.</li><li>\u2022 Cystometrogram is a plot of intravesical pressure against the volume of fluid in the bladder. The curve shows three segments:</li><li>\u2022 Initial Filling Phase (or Low-Pressure Phase ): This phase represents the storage phase of bladder function. Rapid Filling Phase (or High-Pressure Phase): In this phase, the intravesical pressure increases more rapidly as the bladder volume reaches a certain threshold. The detrusor muscle, which contracts to initiate bladder emptying, starts to generate increased pressure as the bladder approaches its capacity. This phase represents the transition from storage to voiding phase. Voiding Phase (or Micturition Phase): In the voiding phase, the intravesical pressure rises to its highest level as the detrusor muscle contracts forcefully to empty the bladder. The pressure exceeds the urethral resistance, resulting in urine expulsion. This phase is associated with the sensation of needing to urinate and the act of micturition (urination).</li><li>\u2022 Initial Filling Phase (or Low-Pressure Phase ): This phase represents the storage phase of bladder function.</li><li>\u2022 Initial Filling Phase (or Low-Pressure Phase</li><li>\u2022 Rapid Filling Phase (or High-Pressure Phase): In this phase, the intravesical pressure increases more rapidly as the bladder volume reaches a certain threshold.

Segment Ia is due to residual urine : Incorrect. Segment I, particularly the initial part of the curve, typically represents the early filling phase of the bladder, not necessarily residual urine.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Segment Ia is due to residual urine</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Micturition fails to happen in segment II : Incorrect. Segment II represents the continuation of the filling phase; micturition (urination) does not occur here because it typically begins when the bladder reaches its threshold capacity and the detrusor muscle contracts, which would be represented later in the graph.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Micturition fails to happen in segment II</li><li>\u2022 Option D. The dotted line represents that micturition has occurred : Incorrect. The dotted line likely indicates phase transitions within the bladder's filling and voiding cycle, not necessarily the occurrence of micturition.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. The dotted line represents that micturition has occurred</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Segment II of a cystometrogram, characterized by Laplace's Law, illustrates how the bladder can accommodate increasing volumes of urine with minimal increase in pressure, showcasing the bladder's compliance during the urine storage phase. This is crucial for diagnosing and managing conditions related to bladder storage and voiding dysfunction.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
