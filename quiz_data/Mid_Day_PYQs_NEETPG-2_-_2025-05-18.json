FSGS accounts for approximately 10-15% of pediatric nephrotic syndrome cases. It is characterized by sclerosis in parts (segmental) of some (focal) glomeruli, with fusion of the foot processes of podocytes visible on electron microscopy.</li><li>\u2022 FSGS is often associated with the NPHS2 gene mutation, which affects the protein podocin in the glomerular filtration barrier.

It is actually a sign associated with fracture of the zygomatic arch, where tenderness is elicited on pressing the fractured fragments. This sign has no relationship to lateral sinus thrombosis or any other otological condition.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Queckenstedt's Test : This is correctly associated with lateral sinus thrombosis diagnosis. Also called the Tobey-Ayer test, it involves compression of the jugular vein while monitoring CSF pressure via lumbar puncture. In lateral sinus thrombosis, compression of the affected side's jugular vein causes no change in CSF pressure, while compression of the normal side increases CSF pressure.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Queckenstedt's Test</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Crowe-Beck Test : This is correctly used for diagnosing lateral sinus thrombosis. It is an alternative to Queckenstedt's test that avoids lumbar puncture. It involves observing retinal vein engorgement through fundoscopy during jugular compression. With lateral sinus thrombosis, compression of the affected side causes no retinal vein engorgement, while compression of the normal side does.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Crowe-Beck Test</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Griesinger's Sign : This is correctly associated with lateral sinus thrombosis. It refers to edema and tenderness over the mastoid emissary vein (posterior to the mastoid process), which occurs due to thrombophlebitis extending from the lateral sinus to the emissary vein.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.
