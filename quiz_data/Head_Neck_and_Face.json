D) Buccal Nerve</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Hypoglossal nerve rests over hyoglossus and is related to the medial surface and cervical branch of facial nerve to the inferior surface of the gland. The hypoglossal nerve ( CN XII ) runs close to the submandibular gland , especially as it travels in the submandibular region towards the tongue . It is responsible for motor innervation to the muscles of the tongue .

Initially lies above and lateral , then winds around its lower border , then ascends medial to it. The lingual nerve , a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve ( CN V3 ), provides sensory innervation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and the floor of the mouth .

It is formed by the union of the posterior division of the retromandibular vein and the posterior auricular vein . Anterior Jugular Vein : This vein collects blood from the front of the neck . The left and right anterior jugular veins often connect via a jugular venous arch at the base of the neck before draining into the subclavian vein . Vertebral Vein : This vein drains the cervical spinal cord and posterior part of the skull . It travels with the vertebral artery within the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae before emptying into the subclavian vein . Internal Thoracic (Mammary) Vein : This vein runs along the inner side of the front of the chest wall and drains the breasts , anterior thoracic wall , and parts of the abdominal wall . It is a companion to the internal thoracic artery . Dorsal Scapular Vein : This vein drains the region around the scapula and the muscles attached to it .

Parasympathetic Pathway: Preganglionic Neurons, the pathway begins with the preganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the superior salivatory nucleus . These neurons send their axons via the facial nerve . Greater Petrosal Nerve: The fibers then branch off from the facial nerve to form the greater petrosal nerve, which carries these parasympathetic fibers . Pterygopalatine Ganglion: The fibers from the greater petrosal nerve synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion, located in the pterygopalatine fossa . Postganglionic Neurons: From the pterygopalatine ganglion, the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers join the branches of the maxillary nerve and reach the lacrimal gland . Sympathetic Pathway: Though the primary control of lacrimal secretion is parasympathetic , there is also a sympathetic innervation. Sympathetic fibers originate in the superior cervical ganglion and follow a pathway along the internal carotid artery , eventually joining the parasympathetic pathway to the lacrimal gland . Sympathetic innervation primarily modulates the blood flow to the gland rather than directly stimulating secretion . Sensory Pathway: Sensory innervation to the lacrimal gland is provided by the lacrimal nerve , a branch of the ophthalmic nerve . This is not directly involved in tear secretion but can influence it reflexively in response to sensory stimuli. Reflex Arc: The lacrimal reflex arc is important in tear production . Sensory input from the cornea and conjunctiva can trigger a reflex increase in tear production via the parasympathetic pathway .

The greater petrosal nerve carries parasympathetic preganglionic fibers that originate in the superior salivatory nucleus of the brainstem. These fibers travel through the facial nerve and exit via the geniculate ganglion . From there, they join the greater petrosal nerve , which then synapses in the pterygopalatine ganglion. The postganglionic fibers from the pterygopalatine ganglion go on to innervate several structures in the head , including the lacrimal gland (for tear production), the nasal glands (for mucus production), and the palatal and pharyngeal glands (for secretion). This parasympathetic pathway is involved in controlling various secretory functions in the head and is associated with the facial nerve through the greater petrosal nerve .</li><li>\u27a4 facial nerve</li><li>\u27a4 cranial nerve VII</li><li>\u27a4 greater petrosal nerve</li><li>\u27a4 parasympathetic preganglionic fibers</li><li>\u27a4 originate</li><li>\u27a4 superior salivatory nucleus</li><li>\u27a4 brainstem.</li><li>\u27a4 facial nerve</li><li>\u27a4 exit</li><li>\u27a4 geniculate ganglion</li><li>\u27a4 greater petrosal nerve</li><li>\u27a4 synapses</li><li>\u27a4 pterygopalatine ganglion.</li><li>\u27a4 postganglionic fibers</li><li>\u27a4 pterygopalatine ganglion</li><li>\u27a4 head</li><li>\u27a4 lacrimal gland</li><li>\u27a4 nasal glands</li><li>\u27a4 palatal</li><li>\u27a4 pharyngeal glands</li><li>\u27a4 head</li><li>\u27a4 facial nerve</li><li>\u27a4 greater petrosal nerve</li><li>\u27a4 Ref : IB Singh Textbook of Anatomy Vol. 3 Head and Neck, Neuroanatomy 7 th Edition Pg 395</li><li>\u27a4 Ref :</li><li>\u27a4 IB Singh Textbook of Anatomy Vol. 3 Head and Neck, Neuroanatomy 7 th Edition Pg 395</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

The hypoglossal nerve innervates the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue ( except for the palatoglossus muscle , which is innervated by the vagus nerve ).

When the hypoglossal nerve is injured on one side, the tongue muscles on that side become weaker . When the patient attempts to protrude the tongue , it will deviate towards the weakened ( affected ) side . This is because the normal or unaffected side pushes the tongue towards the weakened side .</li><li>\u2022 Option B: True</li><li>\u2022 hypoglossal nerve</li><li>\u2022 tongue muscles</li><li>\u2022 side</li><li>\u2022 weaker</li><li>\u2022 attempts</li><li>\u2022 protrude</li><li>\u2022 tongue</li><li>\u2022 deviate</li><li>\u2022 weakened</li><li>\u2022 affected</li><li>\u2022 side</li><li>\u2022 normal</li><li>\u2022 unaffected</li><li>\u2022 side</li><li>\u2022 weakened side</li><li>\u2022 Option D: True .

The greater petrosal nerve is a branch of the facial nerve ( cranial nerve VII ) and carries parasympathetic and sensory fibers . It arises from the geniculate ganglion and passes through the middle cranial fossa . The nerve provides parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland (involved in tear production ) and to mucous membranes of the nose and palate . It travels through the foramen lacerum (though not passing entirely through it, as this foramen is mostly filled with cartilage) and enters the pterygoid canal , where it combines with the deep petrosal nerve to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal ( Vidian nerve ).</li><li>\u2022 Option A:</li><li>\u2022 geniculate ganglion</li><li>\u2022 facial nerve</li><li>\u2022 cranial nerve VII</li><li>\u2022 parasympathetic</li><li>\u2022 sensory fibers</li><li>\u2022 geniculate ganglion</li><li>\u2022 middle cranial fossa</li><li>\u2022 parasympathetic innervation</li><li>\u2022 lacrimal gland</li><li>\u2022 tear production</li><li>\u2022 mucous membranes</li><li>\u2022 nose</li><li>\u2022 palate</li><li>\u2022 foramen lacerum</li><li>\u2022 pterygoid canal</li><li>\u2022 deep petrosal nerve</li><li>\u2022 nerve</li><li>\u2022 pterygoid canal</li><li>\u2022 Vidian nerve</li><li>\u2022 Option B: Deep petrosal nerve arises from plexus around internal carotid artery . The deep petrosal nerve carries postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the carotid plexus . It does not contain sensory or parasympathetic fibers. The deep petrosal nerve passes through the carotid canal alongside the internal carotid artery and then through the foramen lacerum , though it does not exit the skull through this foramen.

She reports no symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, and her thyroid function tests are within normal limits. Given the presence of the thyroid nodule, further evaluation including ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration is planned. In preparation for potential surgical intervention, the surgical team reviews the vascular anatomy of the thyroid gland, focusing on the venous drainage, to minimize the risk of intraoperative bleeding. Understanding the venous drainage of the thyroid gland is crucial for thyroidectomy procedures. Which of the following veins is responsible for draining the middle thyroid vein?",
