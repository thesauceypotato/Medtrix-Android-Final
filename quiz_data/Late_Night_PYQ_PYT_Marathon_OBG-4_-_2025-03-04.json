Adequacy Check : The patient is asked to perform a Valsalva maneuver (forceful exhalation against a closed airway) to see if the pessary remains in place, ensuring it is not dislodged during increased intra-abdominal pressure.

The spiral artery supplies blood to the endometrium. In normal pregnancy, there is an invasion of the extravillous trophoblasts (specifically, endovascular trophoblasts) into the walls of the spiral arteries. This process takes place in two waves: First wave (10-12 weeks): Endovascular trophoblasts invade up to the decidual segments. Second wave (16-18 weeks): Endovascular trophoblasts invade up to the myometrial segments. This invasion results in the distension of the spiral arterioles, transforming them into a low-resistance, low-pressure, and high-flow system. In preeclampsia, the failure of the second wave of endovascular trophoblastic invasion into uterine vessels leads to decreased placental perfusion.</li><li>\u2022 Preeclampsia occurs due to the failure of the invasion of extravillous trophoblasts into the spiral artery.</li><li>\u2022 The spiral artery supplies blood to the endometrium.

While both are primarily unilateral, Bartholin abscesses are often tender to palpation, erythematous, indurated, and may have an area of fluctuance and/or purulent drainage. Treatment Asymptomatic Bartholin cysts do not require further treatment. Bartholin abscesses may be treated with incision and drainage with Word catheter placement due to ease and effectiveness of treatment. Marsupialization is the procedure of choice. Women with recurrent cysts or those who are post-menopausal (risk of malignancy) should have the cyst completely excised.</li><li>\u2022 The physical exam will often reveal asymmetry with a protrusion of one side (left or right) of the inferior aspect of the vulva.</li><li>\u2022 Bartholin gland abscesses, unlike Bartholin cysts, are very painful.</li><li>\u2022 While both are primarily unilateral, Bartholin abscesses are often tender to palpation, erythematous, indurated, and may have an area of fluctuance and/or purulent drainage.</li><li>\u2022 Treatment</li><li>\u2022 Asymptomatic Bartholin cysts do not require further treatment.</li><li>\u2022 Bartholin abscesses may be treated with incision and drainage with Word catheter placement due to ease and effectiveness of treatment.</li><li>\u2022 Marsupialization is the procedure of choice.</li><li>\u2022 Women with recurrent cysts or those who are post-menopausal (risk of malignancy) should have the cyst completely excised.</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
