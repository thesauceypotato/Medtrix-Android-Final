Relies on the principle of type IV hypersensitivity reaction. Method: A series of allergens are applied to the back The allergens on the patch include latex, medications, preservatives, hair dyes, fragrances, resins, and various metals. It needs to stay for 2 to 4 days Positive result: shows erythema & papules or vesicles After 48 hours , the patch is removed and erythema is noted Another read is taken after 96 hours to check for any delayed reaction.
