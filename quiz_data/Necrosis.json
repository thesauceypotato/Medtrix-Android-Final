Caseous necrosis is encountered most often in foci of tuberculous infection . The term caseous ( cheese-like ) is derived from the friable white appearance of the area of necrosis . Option: B. Coagulative necrosis. Form of necrosis in which the architecture of dead tissue is preserved for a span of at least some days. The affected tissue has a firm texture (vs Liquefactive necrosis which is characterized by digestion of the dead cells , resulting in the transformation of the tissue into a viscous liquid) .

They are produced by neutrophils in response to infectious pathogens ( mainly bacteria and fungi ) and inflammatory mediators (e.g., chemokines, cytokines [mainly interferons], complement proteins, and ROS ). The extracellular traps consist of a viscous meshwork of nuclear chromatin that binds and concentrates granule proteins such as antimicrobial peptides and enzymes. In this process, the nuclei of the neutrophils are lost, leading to the death of the cells . The nuclear chromatin in the NETs , which includes histones and associated DNA, has been postulated to be a source of nuclear antigens in systemic autoimmune diseases , particularly lupus , in which individuals react against their own DNA and nucleoproteins. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). (A) Healthy neutrophils with nuclei stained red and cytoplasm stained green. (B) Release of nuclear material from neutrophils (note that two have lost their nuclei), forming extracellular traps. (C) Electron micrograph of bacteria (staphylococci) trapped in NETs.
