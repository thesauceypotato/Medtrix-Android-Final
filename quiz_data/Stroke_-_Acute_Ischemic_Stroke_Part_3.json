The swelling can be asymmetric at first ( Hemi Orolingual Angioedema )and can develop in a location contralateral to the ischemic lesion following a stroke.

Stroke caused by heart disease is primarily due to embolism of thrombotic material forming on the atrial or ventricular wall or the left heart valves. These thrombi then detach and embolize into the arterial circulation. The thrombus may fragment or lyse quickly, producing only a TIA. OR may last longer, producing a stroke. Embolic strokes tend to occur suddenly with maximum neurologic deficit present at onset. With reperfusion following more prolonged ischemia, petechial haemorrhages can occur within the ischemic territory. These are usually of no clinical significance and should be distinguished from frank intracranial haemorrhage into a region of the ischemic stroke where the mass effect from the haemorrhage can cause a significant decline in neurologic function. Emboli from the heart most often lodge in the intracranial internal carotid artery , the MCA , the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) , or one of their branches; infrequently, the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) is involved. Emboli large enough to occlude the stem of the MCA (3\u20134 mm) or internal carotid terminus lead to large infarcts that involve deep grey and white matter and some portions of the cortical surface and its underlying white matter. A smaller embolism may occlude a small cortical or penetrating arterial branch.

If a relevant brain infarction is identified on brain imaging, the clinical entity is now classified as a stroke regardless of the duration of symptoms. A normal brain imaging study following a TIA does not rule out TIA ; rather, the clinical syndrome is diagnostic . The causes of TIA are similar to the causes of ischemic stroke, but because TIAs may herald stroke, they are an important risk factor that should be considered separately and urgently. TIAs may arise from emboli to the brain or from in situ thrombosis of an intracranial vessel. With a TIA , the occluded blood vessel reopens and neurologic function is restored. The risk of stroke after a TIA is ~10\u201315% in the first 3 months , with most events occurring in the first 2 days. This risk can be directly estimated using the well-validated ABCD2 score. Therefore, urgent evaluation and treatment are justified. Because etiologies for stroke and TIA are identical, evaluation for TIA should parallel that of stroke.

Several trials have confirmed that statin drugs reduce the risk of stroke even in patients without elevated LDL or low HDL. The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial showed benefit in secondary stroke reduction for patients with recent stroke or TIA who were prescribed atorvastatin, 80 mg/d. The primary prevention trial, Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) , found that patients with low LDL (<130 mg/dL) caused by elevated C-reactive protein benefitted by daily use of this statin. Primary stroke occurrence was reduced by 51% and there was no increase in the rates of intracranial haemorrhage. Meta-analysis has also supported a primary treatment effect for statins given acutely for ischemic stroke. A serum LDL <70 mg/dL lowers recurrent stroke risk better than an LDL of 90\u2013110 mg/dL. Therefore, a statin should be considered in all patients with prior ischemic stroke.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options A, B, and D are incorrect.

The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial ( SPRINT trial )suggest that lowering systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg reduces stroke and heart attack by 43% compared to systolic blood pressure <140 mmHg , without an increased risk of syncope or falls. Option D. High level of LDL lowers the risk of recurrent stroke- There is a well-established inverse relation between serum concentrations of HDL cholesterol and the risk of coronary heart disease ,but it is not a well-documented risk factor for stroke.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Risk Factors for Stroke RISK FACTOR RELATIVE RISK RELATIVE RISK REDUCTION WITH TREATMENT Hypertension 2-5 38% Atrial fibrillation 1.8-2.9 68% warfarin, 21% aspirin Diabetes 1.8-6 No proven effect Smoking 1.8 50% at 1 year, baseline risk at 5 years post-cessation Hyperlipidemia 1.8-2.6 16-30% Asymptomatic carotid stenosis 2.0 53% Symptomatic carotid stenosis (70-99%) 65% at 2 years Symptomatic carotid stenosis (50-69%) 29% at 5 years</p>\n<p></p>",

That is areas of ischemic brain tissue that have not yet undergone irreversible infarction , implying that these regions are potentially salvageable if ischemia can be reversed . Factors that may exacerbate ischemic brain injury include systemic hypotension and hypoxia, which further reduce substrate delivery to vulnerable brain tissue, and fever, seizures, and hyperglycemia, which can increase cellular metabolism , outstripping compensatory processes. The penumbra can be imaged by perfusion imaging using MRI or CT. Predicted region of infarct (red) and penumbra (green) based on CT perfusion data. Focal cerebral infarction occurs via two distinct pathways (1) a necrotic pathway in which cellular cytoskeletal breakdown is rapid, due principally to energy failure of the cell and Without ATP, membrane ion pumps stop functioning and neurons depolarize , allowing intracellular calcium to rise. Cellular depolarization also causes glutamate release from synaptic terminals ; excess extracellular glutamate produces neurotoxicity by activating postsynaptic glutamate receptors that increase neuronal calcium influx. Ischemia also injures or destroys axons, dendrites, and glia within brain tissue. Free radicals are produced by degradation of membrane lipids and mitochondrial dysfunction. Free radicals cause catalytic destruction of membranes and likely damage other vital functions of Cells. (2) an apoptotic pathway in which cells become programmed to die. Ischemia produces necrosis by starving neurons of glucose and oxygen , which in turn results in failure of mitochondria to produce ATP. Lesser degrees of ischemia , as are seen within the ischemic penumbra , favor apoptotic cellular death, c ausing cells to die days to weeks later.

Option A. It is reversible- ischemic penumbra which has not yet undergone irreversible infarction , implying that these regions are potentially salvageable if ischemia can be reversed . Option C. The penumbra can be imaged by perfusion imaging using MRI or CT-. CT perfusion imaging increases the sensitivity for detecting ischemia and can measure the ischemic penumbra. Alternatively, MR perfusion can be combined with MR diffusion imaging to identify the ischemic penumbra as the mismatch between these two imaging sequences. Option D. Saving the ischemic penumbra is the goal of revascularization therapies- Current evidence-based treatments involve restoration of blood flow so as to salvage the penumbra before it evolves into irreversibly damaged tissue, termed the 'core'. Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) can salvage the penumbra if given within 4.5 hr after stroke onset. Without specific therapy, the region of infarction will expand into much or all the perfusion deficit.</p>\n<p></p>",

If a relevant brain infarction is identified on brain imaging, the clinical entity is now classified as a stroke regardless of the duration of symptoms. A normal brain imaging study following a TIA does not rule out TIA ; rather, the clinical syndrome is diagnostic . The causes of TIA are similar to the causes of ischemic stroke, but because TIAs may herald stroke, they are an important risk factor that should be considered separately and urgently. TIAs may arise from emboli to the brain or from in situ thrombosis of an intracranial vessel. With a TIA , the occluded blood vessel reopens and neurologic function is The risk of stroke after a TIA is ~10\u201315% in the first 3 months , with most events occurring in the first 2 days. This risk can be directly estimated using the well-validated ABCD2 score. Therefore, urgent evaluation and treatment are justified.

High-risk stroke or any cardiovascular event within 90 days.
