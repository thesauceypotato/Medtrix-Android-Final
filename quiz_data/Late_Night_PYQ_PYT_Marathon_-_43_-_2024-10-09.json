This, in turn, improves respiratory dynamics and resuscitative efforts. Fetal Outcome : The infant has a higher chance of survival if PMCS is performed within 10 minutes of maternal death.

The Rotavirus vaccine, a live attenuated oral vaccine, is known to slightly increase the risk of intussusception, particularly within the first week after the initial doses. This risk, although slightly elevated, does not outweigh the vaccine's benefits in preventing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis, which can lead to significant dehydration, hospitalization, and even death in infants. This association necessitates vigilance for symptoms of intussusception following vaccination, particularly when parents report abdominal symptoms after the vaccine.</li><li>\u2022 Rotavirus vaccines:</li><li>\u2022 Rotavirus vaccines:</li><li>\u2022 There are 4 types of Rotavirus vaccines, but only 2 are used in the National Immunization Schedule (NIS).</li><li>\u2022 ROTAVAC and ROTASIIL are the commonly used vaccines; both are live attenuated vaccines, lyophilized with a diluent citrate bicarbonate buffer.</li><li>\u2022 ROTAVAC</li><li>\u2022 ROTASIIL</li><li>\u2022 ROTAVAC : Administered in a dose of 0.5 ml per dose.</li><li>\u2022 ROTAVAC</li><li>\u2022 ROTASIIL : Administered in a dose of 2.5 ml with a 6 ml syringe.</li><li>\u2022 ROTASIIL</li><li>\u2022 The vaccination schedule includes 3 doses given at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age.</li><li>\u2022 A known complication of these vaccines is intussusception , which requires careful monitoring after administration.</li><li>\u2022 intussusception</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
