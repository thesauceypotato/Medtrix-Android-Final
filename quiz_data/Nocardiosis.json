      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Actinomadura or Nocardia Actinomadura matures, Actinomadura Pelletier and Actinomadura dassonvillei are the species included in the genus Actinomadura. Actinomadura mature is an aerobic actinomycete that is best known worldwide as the cause of actinomycotic mycetomas.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mycetoma Actinomycetoma occurs in tropical countries within the 'mycetoma belt' from 15 degrees south to 30 degrees north of the equator. The infection is acquired by direct inoculation via the skin. Mycetoma is a chronic, slow-growing, destructive infection, usually involving the hands or feet, and characterized by the spread of the infecting organism from its subcutaneous site of implantation to adjacent structures. Serous discharges contain small grains of organism colonies. Actinomycetoma\u2014 caused by filamentous branching bacteria. Eumycetoma (TRUE MYCETOMA)\u2014 caused by fungi. Triad: Subcutaneous swelling +Discharging sinuses+ Granules in sinuses Granules contains Silver Eumycetoma Actinomycetoma Fungus -(40%) Bacteria - (60%) Single mass with well defined margins, Serous, black in colour, Osteosclerotic Multiple, ill defined margins, osteolytic, Purulet, White/Red Black granules : Madurella MC: Nocardia >Actinomadura madurae> Streptomyces: white granules White granules: Pseudoallescheria, Aspergillus fusarium Actinomadura pelletieri :Pink to Red granules Treatment There is a role for surgery in combination with effective medical treatment, e.g. for bulk reduction. Treatment success depends on the identification of the causative organism. All cases of actinomycetoma are treated with a combination of streptomycin sulfate and a second agent determined by the causal species (e.g. dapsone for A. mature) . Eumycetoma is treated with azoles, usually itraconazole, ketoconazole, or voriconazole (preferred for P. boydii). Treatment continues in all cases fo r at least 12 months , longer with extensive bone involvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Nocardia, Actinomadura, and Streptomyces spp. are the common aetiological agents of actinomycetoma. But exophiala does not cause the same. Option C & D. Sporothrix and Acremonium are not associated with mycetoma.</p>\n<p></p>",

Actinomyces and Nocardia are Gram-positive rods characterized by filamentous, tree-like branching growth. They are opportunists that can sometimes produce indolent, slowly progressive diseases. Option D. Nocardia can usually be differentiated from Actinomyces by acid-fast staining, as Nocardia typically exhibit varying degrees of acid fastness due to the mycolic acid content of the cell wall. A cid fastness is weak/ partial and can only be appreciated with 1% H2SO4 Option D, B, and C. These are all common features of Nocardia and actinomyces.</p>\n<p></p>",
