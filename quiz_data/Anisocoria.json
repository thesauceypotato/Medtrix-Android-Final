Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disorder with antibodies against the myelin sheath of nerve fibres. The peak onset is between 20-40 years of age and females are more commonly affected. It has a relapsing-remitting course . Patients with multiple sclerosis present with a variety of motor and sensory symptoms which may have asymmetrical involvement. Option: B. A brainstem lesion leading to oculomotor nerve palsy may lead to ptosis but there will be accompanying signs of ophthalmoplegia and signs of other cranial nerve palsies, motor and/or sensory deficits depending on the location of the lesion. Option: D. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder seen mostly in females of age group 20-30 years which is characterized by generalized muscle weakness and rapidly developing fatigue of the muscles which increases as the day progresses and improves with rest. Ptosis is a symptom of MG, however, other relevant histories like the middle-aged female, and generalized weakness, are missing making the diagnosis of MG unlikely.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The syndrome associated with Horner Syndrome is Pancoast Tumor Clinical Presentation - Shoulder and arm pain (90%) weakness of the muscles of the hand, Horner Syndrome.
