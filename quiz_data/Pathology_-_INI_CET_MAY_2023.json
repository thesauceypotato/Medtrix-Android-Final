      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>2, 3,4 Necrosis is always pathological</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Necrosis is a form of cell death in which cellular membranes fall apart, and cellular enzymes leak out and ultimately digest the cell Necrosis is characterized by changes in the cytoplasm and nuclei of the injured cells Cytoplasmic changes : Necrotic cells show increased eosinophilia, a glassy homogeneous appearance. Myelin figures are more prominent in necrotic cells Nuclear changes : Pyknosis is characterized by nuclear shrinkage and increased basophilia; the DNA condenses into a dark shrunken mass. The pyknotic nucleus can undergo fragmentation; this change is called karyorrhexis. Ultimately, the nucleus may undergo karyolysis, in which the basophilia fades because of digestion of DNA by deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activity Fates of necrotic cells. Necrotic cells may persist for some time or may be digested by enzymes and disappear. Dead cells may be replaced by myelin figures, which are either phagocytosed by other cells or further degraded into fatty acids</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Congo red Staining with Congo Red dye (CR) is one of the major methods used to detect the amyloid structure of protein aggregates</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>With the light microscope and hematoxylin and eosin stains, amyloid appears as an amorphous, eosinophilic, hyaline, extracellular substance. To differentiate amyloid from other hyaline materials (e.g., collagen, fibrin), a variety of histochemical stains are used. The most widely used is the Congo red stain, which under ordinary light gives a pink or red color to tissue deposits , but far more striking and specific is the green birefringence of the stained amyloid when observed by polarizing microscopy, due to the crossed B-pleated sheet configuration of amyloid fibrils. Another stain that is often used in combination with Congo Red is Thioflavin T. This dye also binds to amyloid fibrils and exhibits fluorescence when bound, which can enhance the detection of amyloid deposits under fluorescence microscopy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option B. Masson\u2019s trichrome is a stain that highlights collagen fibers. This method is very popular and is used in histology to differentiate collagen and muscle fibers on tissue sections. It is particularly used in the study of pathologies of the heart (infarction), liver (cirrhosis), kidney (glomerular fibrosis) Mason\u2019s Trichrome Staining Option C. Fontana Masson stain is used to demonstrate argentaffinic substances, most often melanin, but also argentaffin granules, which are found in carcinoid tumors, in the digestive tract or lung. Option D. Oil Red O is a lysochrome diazo dye used for staining of neutral triglycerides and lipids on frozen sections and some lipoproteins on paraffin sections.</p>\n<p></p>",

The gene encodes for the HTT protein, which plays a role in the synaptic function and also plays a crucial role in the post-embryonic period. The length of the repeats also determines 70% of the variation in the age of onset. The anticipation phenomenon is seen in the paternal line of inheritance, which arises due to the instability of the CAG repeats during spermatogenesis. Anticipation leads to a phenomenon that is common in HD, where an affected offspring of a patient with the condition will develop the disorder at a younger age than the relative who passed on that gene. Sickle cell disease is inherited in an Autosomal recessive pattern. Caused due to point (missense) mutation resulting in substituting glutamic acid by valine at 6th position of beta chain. Forms mutant HbS with altered solubility. Because valine is water-insoluble without affecting function, stability or structure. Occurs in different three forms : 1. As heterozygous state Sickle cell trait (SA) \u2013 25-40% HbS Gives protection against falciparum malaria 2. As homozygous state: Sickle cell anemia (SS) \u2013 70% HbS 3. As double heterozygous state Eg: Sickle beta thalassemia, Sickle-C-disease HbF inhibits HbS polymerization. Hence infants are asymptomatic until 6 months</p>\n<p></p>",
