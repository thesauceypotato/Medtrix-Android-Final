NET formation also has some negative consequences. The exposure of nuclear antigens during NETosis can lead to an increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The nuclear antigens released during NET formation can be recognized as \"self\" by the immune system, leading to the production of autoantibodies and the development of SLE.</li><li>\u2022 Option C: Higher risk of SLE:</li><li>\u2022 Option D: Affected cell does not survive: True. In NET formation, the neutrophil undergoes a form of cell death called NETotic cell death. The affected neutrophil does not survive the process of NETosis, as it involves the release of its cellular contents, including DNA and enzymes. This process is sometimes referred to as \"beneficial suicide\" because the neutrophil sacrifices itself to create the extracellular trap that can capture and kill pathogens.</li><li>\u2022 Option D: Affected cell does not survive:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Neutrophil extracellular traps are induced by sepsis, increase the risk of developing SLE due to exposure of nuclear antigens, and result in the death of the affected neutrophil, but they do not enhance phagocytosis.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Therefore, the recommended management is to repeat an ultrasound between 28 to 32 weeks to reassess the position of the placenta.

Niacin can be synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan, with 60 mg of tryptophan converting to 1 mg of niacin daily. Tryptophan deficiency is common in maize-based diets, but the actual reason for pellagra in maize eaters is not tryptophan deficiency itself, but rather an excess of leucine, which prevents the conversion of tryptophan to niacin. Leucine is therefore known as the pellagrogenic amino acid of India.</li><li>\u2022 Pellagra is characterized by the \"4 D's\": diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death.

Complete mole is triploid, partial mole is diploid: This statement is incorrect. A complete mole is diploid (46XX or 46XY), typically arising from fertilization of an egg with no genetic material by one or two sperm. A partial mole is usually triploid (69XXX, 69XXY, or 69XYY), resulting from fertilization of a normal egg by two sperm or by one sperm that duplicates its chromosomes.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Complete mole is triploid, partial mole is diploid:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Multi-agent chemotherapy is indicated in low-risk choriocarcinoma : This statement is incorrect. Low-risk choriocarcinoma is typically treated with single-agent chemotherapy, such as methotrexate. Multi-agent chemotherapy is reserved for high-risk cases.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Multi-agent chemotherapy is indicated in low-risk choriocarcinoma</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Lung metastases indicate a high-risk tumor : This statement is incorrect. While lung metastases indicate metastasis, in the context of gestational trophoblastic disease, they often respond well to treatment and are considered low risk when the disease is confined to the lungs and shows good prognosis with methotrexate treatment.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
