A) Stop warfarin and start LMWH.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Stop warfarin and start LMWH: Warfarin is teratogenic and has a significant risk of causing warfarin embryopathy, particularly in doses greater than 5mg per day. In pregnancy, it is recommended to change warfarin to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the first trimester, especially if the warfarin dose exceeds 5 mg/day. After 13 weeks, it can be switched back to warfarin until delivery. Near delivery, warfarin should again be replaced by LMWH or UFH to manage the risk of bleeding complications during delivery.</li><li>\u2022 Stop warfarin and start LMWH:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Stop warfarin and start heparin: This option is partially correct as it aligns with the practice of switching from warfarin to a safer anticoagulant near delivery. However, the preferred anticoagulant in this situation is LMWH due to its predictable pharmacokinetics and ease of administration.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Stop warfarin and start heparin:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Continue warfarin: This is incorrect because continuing warfarin at 36 weeks of gestation poses significant risks of fetal hemorrhage and warfarin embryopathy. It is essential to switch to a safer anticoagulant like LMWH or UFH close to delivery.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Continue warfarin:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Stop warfarin, start LMWH and aspirin: While this option includes stopping warfarin and starting LMWH, which is correct, the addition of aspirin is only indicated in women who are at a very high risk of thrombosis. The general recommendation does not include aspirin unless there is a specific high-risk indication.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

The spiral artery supplies blood to the endometrium. In normal pregnancy, there is an invasion of the extravillous trophoblasts (specifically, endovascular trophoblasts) into the walls of the spiral arteries. This process takes place in two waves: First wave (10-12 weeks): Endovascular trophoblasts invade up to the decidual segments. Second wave (16-18 weeks): Endovascular trophoblasts invade up to the myometrial segments. This invasion results in the distension of the spiral arterioles, transforming them into a low-resistance, low-pressure, and high-flow system. In preeclampsia, the failure of the second wave of endovascular trophoblastic invasion into uterine vessels leads to decreased placental perfusion.</li><li>\u2022 Preeclampsia occurs due to the failure of the invasion of extravillous trophoblasts into the spiral artery.</li><li>\u2022 The spiral artery supplies blood to the endometrium.

Post-operatively, continuous bladder drainage for 14 days along with antibiotics is recommended to facilitate healing. Following VVF repair, it is recommended that the patient abstain from sexual activity for 3 months to allow the surgical site to heal properly and avoid complications.
