Diagnosis can be made based on the localization of electrode placement and tracing of associated areas. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare rapidly progressive demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by reactivation of latent John Cunningham (JC) polyomavirus (JCV) infection.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>c wave Isovolumetric ventricular contraction: Begins during the QRS complex , which represents electrical activation of the ventricles. When ventricular pressure becomes greater than atrial pressure, the AV valves close. Their closure corresponds to the first heart Because the mitral valve closes before the tricuspid valve, the first heart sound may be split. Ventricular pressure increases isovolumetrically as a result of ventricular contraction. However, no blood leaves the ventricle during this phase because the aortic valve is closed.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>A normal ECG trace (on the top) and Jugular venous (JV) pressure waveforms (on the bottom). In a normal JV pressure trace the R peak of the ECG signal happens between the a peak and the c peak of the JV waveform. The normal jugular venous pulse contains three positive waves. By convention these are labeled \"a,\" \"c\", and \"v\". These positive deflections occur, respectively, before the carotid upstroke and just after the P wave of the ECG (a wave); simultaneous with the upstroke of the carotid pulse (c wave); and during ventricular systole until the tricuspid valve opens (v wave). The a wave is generated by atrial contraction, which actively fills the right ventricle in end-diastole. The c wave is caused either by transmission of the carotid arterial impulse through the external and internal jugular veins or by the bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium in early systole. The v wave reflects the passive increase in pressure and volume of the right atrium as it fills in late systole and early diastole. Normally the crests of the a and v waves are approximately equal in amplitude. The descents or troughs of the jugular venou pulse occur between the \"a\" and \"c\" wave (\"x\" descent), between the \"c\" and \"v\" wave (\"x\" descent), and between the \"v\" and \"a\" wave (\"y\" descent). The x and x' descents reflect movement of the lower portion of the right atrium toward the right ventricle during the final phases of the ventricular systole. The y descent represents the abrupt termination of the down stroke of the v wav during early diastole after the tricuspid valve opens and the right ventricle begins to fill passively. Normally the y descent is neither as brisk nor as deep as the x descent. Depolarisation of atria (P wave) is soon followed by atrial contraction that will lead to 'a' wave of atrial pressure. The next step of the cardiac cycle is closure of the mitral and tricuspid wall resulting in first heart sound. The T wave on ECG represents ventricular repolarization that will be followed by ventricular diastole rapid ventricular filling which occurs later.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Figure: The cardiac cycle.

TACO typically occurs in patients who receive a large volume of a transfused product over a short period of time, especially those with underlying cardiovascular or renal disease. Here pulmonary edema that occurs within 6 hrs of transfusion is cardiogenic (hydrostatic) in origin; similar to that in MI (due to volume overload a/w transfusion). This can be differentiated from TRALI and ARDS in that pulmonary edema is noncardiogenic. During or within several hours of transfusion, patients develop respiratory distress, and may develop orthopnea, cyanosis, tachycardia, and hypertension. Rales can be identified on auscultation, and some patients may have jugular venous distention, an S3 on cardiac auscultation, or lower extremity edema. A chest radiograph can reveal cardiomegaly and interstitial infiltrates, but not all patients with heart failure will have these abnormalities. CXR should be ordered immediately in this patient so as to identify pulmonary edema, pleural effusions (more consistent with TACO than in TRALI) and see evidence of other pulmonary disease along with cardiomegaly and interstitial infiltrates. Apart from this, BNP can also be used to differentiate TACO from TRALI (released from heart with volume expansion in ventricles from pressure overload). It is a sensitive and specific indicator of cardiogenic pulmonary symptoms. BNP <250 pg/ml is more consistent with TRALI and thus can be used to r/o TACO.

The A-a gradient has important clinical utility as it can help narrow the differential diagnosis for hypoxemia. The A-a gradient calculation is as follows: A-a Gradient = PAO2 \u2013 PaO2. The measurement helps narrow the etiology of hypoxemia as either extrapulmonary (outside of the lungs) or intrapulmonary (inside the lungs). When a patient is hypoxemic , there is a pathologically low partial pressure of oxygen in their body resulting in tissue hypoxia leading to cell injury and eventually cell death and necrosis. Patients with poor ventilation lack oxygen tension throughout their arterial system in addition to the respiratory system. Since both the \"A\" and the \"a\" decrease in concert, the gradient between the two will remain within normal limits (even though both values will decrease).

Sympathetic activation of the heart increases ventricular inotropy , which decreases end-systolic volume . The increased inotropy accompanied by enhanced venous return leads to an increase in stroke volume and ejection fraction, although these changes can be partially offset by very high heart rates. 2 nd concept: Loss of intrinsic inotropy decreases the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) . This leads to an increase in end-systolic volume (red loop). There is also an increase in end-diastolic volume (compensatory increase in preload) Therefore, the net effect is a decrease in stroke volume (shown as a decrease in the width of the pressure-volume loop ). Because stroke volume decreases and end-diastolic volume increases , there is a substantial reduction in ejection fraction (EF) . Note that with acute systolic dysfunction, there is no change in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship ( EDPVR ) .

Therefore, LP may be required to definitively diagnose Glaucoma may present with a prostrating headache associated with nausea and vomiting. The headache often starts with severe eye pain. On physical examination, the eye is often red with a fixed, moderately dilated pupil.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Cluster Headache:- At least 5 attacks with:- Severe or very severe unilateral , orbital , supraorbital or temporal pain lasting 15-180 minutes (untreated) Either or both of the following:- At least 1 of these symptoms ipsilateral to the headache: conjunctival injection or lacrimation or both; nasal congestion or rhinorrhea or both; eyelid edema ; forehead and facial sweating ; sensation of fullness in the ear ; miosis or ptosis or both A sense of restlessness or agitation Attack frequency of between 1 every other day and 8 a day for more than half the time the disorder is active</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

The body normally produces antibodies to HBsAg as part of the normal immune response to infection. HBsAg is the antigen used to make hepatitis B vaccine. Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) : The presence of anti-HBs is generally interpreted as indicating recovery and immunity from hepatitis B virus infection. Anti-HBs also develops in a person who has been successfully vaccinated against hepatitis B. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) usually indicates active HBV replication and risk of transmission of infection. Total hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc): Appears at the onset of symptoms in acute hepatitis B and persists for life. The presence of anti-HBc indicates previous or ongoing infection with hepatitis B virus in an undefined time frame. IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen ( IgM anti-HBc ): Positivity indicates recent infection with hepatitis B virus (\u22646 mos). It\u2019s presence indicates acute infection.
