      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Wilson's disease Wilson's disease (Hepatolenticular degeneration) is an autosomal recessive disorder found on chromosome 13(13q14.3 ) encodes ATP7B copper transporting P-type ATPase mainly expressed in hepatocytes and is critical for biliary copper excretion and copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin. Absence or malfunction of ATP7B results in decreased biliary copper excretion and diffuse accumulation of copper in the cytosol of hepatocytes. With time being copper is overloaded in hepatocytes and redistributed into the brain and kidneys causing toxicity. Wilson's disease is associated with liver disease, degenerative changes in the brain and Kayser Fleischer rings in the cornea. KF rings are absent in young patients with hepatic Wilson's disease but are present in 95% of patients with neurologic symptoms. The age of presentation can vary from 4 to 60 years. Manifestations are more likely to be hepatic in early childhood and neurological in adolescents or adults. Neurological abnormalities are varied and may present as intention tremors, speech difficulties, rigid dystonia, parkinsonism, scholastic deterioration, behavioral problems, convulsions, and choreiform movements.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Caused due to loss of function mutation in the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13q.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Craniopharyngioma Craniopharyngioma is a common tumor in childhood. Two histologic subtypes have been identified, adamantinomatous CP and papillary CP, each with a specific origin and genetic alterations.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Children with CP often present with endocrinologic abnormalities ( growth failure and delayed sexual maturation ) and/or visual changes (decreased acuity or visual field abnormalities). These tumors are often large and heterogeneous, displaying both solid and cystic components, and occur within the suprasellar region. They are minimally invasive, adhere to the adjacent brain parenchyma, and engulf normal brain structures. MRI demonstrates the solid tumor with cystic structures containing fluid of intermediate density, and CT may show calcifications. Surgery is the primary treatment modality, with gross total curative resection. Significant morbidity (panhypopituitarism, growth failure, visual loss) is associated with CPs and their therapy because of the anatomic location. There is no role for chemotherapy in CP.</p>\n<p></p>",

Approximately 50% of patients experience skin involvement at some time during the course of illness. Bone lesions can be single or multiple affecting skull bones( solitary or multiple punched-out lytic lesions) , long bones, vertebrae, mastoid, and mandible. The lesions may be painless or present with pain and local swelling; X-rays show sharp lytic lesions. Clinical manifestation includes vertebral collapse ( vertebra plana ) and spinal compression, pathological fractures in Long bones, chronic draining ears, and early eruption of teeth. Other manifestations include seborrheic skin rash in the scalp area and back, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Langerhans cell histiocytosis presents as blueberry muffin rash in neonates. Wegener's granulomatosis - presents with upper respiratory tract infections but it has granuloma and necrosis. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis -similar presentation most often with fever, maculopapular and or petechial rash, weight loss, and irritability. The initial presentation can vary but is almost very severe and in cases of secondary HLH may be camouflaged by a primary disease process. The acute presentation includes septic shock, acute respiratory distress, seizures, and coma. Physical examination often reveals hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, respiratory distress, and jaundice. Chediak higashi syndrome presents with neurological symptoms and infections</p>\n<p></p>",
