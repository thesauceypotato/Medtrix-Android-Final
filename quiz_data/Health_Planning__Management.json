      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Combination of ABC & VED analysis ABC analysis is based on the number of items required in monetary terms only. It does not take into consideration the criticality of the drugs. VED analysis is based on criticality and importance rather than just the consumption cost. Points are assigned based on cumulative scores considering stockout cost, lead time required to procure, nature of items, and source of supply. The best method is to combine both ABC & VED analysis, which will combine cost vs. criticality. So, ree category categories that may be formed based on this combination are: I: Vital & Costly item 2. Category II: Essential but less costly 3. Category III: Desirable but would not affect the functioning SDE analysis is an inventory control method based on Scarcity, Difficulty, or ease of obtaining the drug.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Zero budget approach The Planning Programming Budgeting System is primarily a system to help decision-makers allocate resources so that an organization's available resources are used in the most effective way to achieve its objectives. The Zero Budget approach is a method by which all budgets start at zero, and no one gets any budget that he cannot specifically justify on a year-to-year basis. Work sampling is a systematic observation and recording of one or more individuals' activities at predetermined or random intervals. It provides quantitative measurement of various activities. Work sampling permits judgments on the appropriateness of current staff, job description, and training. Cost accounting provides essential data on cost structure of any program. Financial records are kept in a manner permitting costs to be associated with the purpose for which they are incurred. Organizational design is a management technique based on behavioral sciences. The organization of health services should be designed to meet people's health needs and demands.</p>\n<p></p>",
