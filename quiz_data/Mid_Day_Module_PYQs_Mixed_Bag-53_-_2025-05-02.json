The abnormal dihydrorhodamine (DHR) test result further supports the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD).</li><li>\u2022 CGD is a rare inherited disorder characterized by defective oxygen-dependent killing of microorganisms by phagocytic cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages. This defect is caused by mutations in the genes encoding components of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex , which is responsible for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) necessary for microbial killing. The inability to produce sufficient ROS leads to recurrent infections, especially with catalase-positive organisms.</li><li>\u2022 genes encoding components of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex</li><li>\u2022 The DHR test is a flow cytometry-based assay that measures the production of ROS by neutrophils after stimulation.

Sialyl Lewis X defect, also known as leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 2 (LAD-2), is a rare disorder characterized by defective leukocyte rolling and adhesion due to a deficiency in the sialyl Lewis X ligand .
