      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Patients taking proton pump inhibitors Vibrio cholerae i s a comma-shaped, oxidase-positive, highly motile, gram-negative rod that is acquired after ingesting contaminated food or water . The infection is not invasive and does not disseminate outside of the gastrointestinal tract. However, the elaboration of the cholera enterotoxin leads to severe, watery diarrhea that can cause death from electrolyte imbalance and dehydration within 12 hours of symptom onset. Cholera is endemic in southern Asia, where seasonal outbreaks are common (peaks occur before and after rainy seasons).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The disease is rare and occurs mainly in patients who ingest contaminated seafood from the Gulf Coast. V cholerae must survive the acidic environment of the stomach to reach the small intestine and cause disease. Because the organism is very acid-sensitive, a high burden of V cholerae is generally required to cause clinical symptoms (> 10 10 organisms from contaminated water or > 10 6 organisms from contaminated food). However, those with inadequate gastric acid production (achlorhydria) can develop the disease with much smaller infectious doses as there is insufficient acid to kill the bacteria. Patients on long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy (eg, omeprazole) have pharmacologically induced achlorhydria; it can also be seen in those with gastritis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Patients with splenectomy are at much higher risk of fulminant infection with encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitides, and Haemophilus influenzae. V cholerae is not encapsulated and not invasive; patients with splenectomy are unlikely to be at greater risk. Option: C. Recent antibiotic use is a strong risk factor for Clostridium difficile colitis, which typically manifests with watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and low-grade fever. C difficile is a spore-forming, toxin-producing, gram-positive organism. Option: D. Patients with chronic liver disease are at increased risk for severe disease with Vibrio vulnificus, which can cause watery diarrhea. However, the ingestion of this pathogen usually leads to severe, rapid-onset sepsis in susceptible patients. In addition, V vulnificus is more likely to cause wound infections than gastroenteritis.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Alkaline peptone water and TCBS agar The above case scenario is suggestive of Cholera infection . In Cholera, the stool is typically non-bilious, cloudy, and watery with mucus flakes without Blood and pus cells resembling rice water. The motility test is done by the Hanging Drop method in which Vibrio is actively motile with sudden rapid movement frequently changing direction like a dart, described as Darting motility. To inhibit the growth of commensals present in a stool sample, the fecal sample should inoculate on both enrichment broth and selective media which contain 0.5-1% salt and have alkaline pH allowing V. Cholerae to grow but inhibit the growth of commensals.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Enrichment broth: Alkaline peptone water (APW) Monsur\u2019s taurocholate tellurite peptone water Selective Media: TCBS agar : Thiosulfate, citrate, bile salts sucrose agar. V. cholerae can ferment sucrose and therefore produce large yellow colonies Alkaline bile salt agar (BSA): cholerae produces translucent oil drop colonies Monsur\u2019s gelatin taurocholate trypticase tellurite agar (GTTTA): V. cholerae produces translucent colonies with a grayish-black center and a turbid halo. Classical biotypes grow better on this medium than on TCBS agar</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. Selenite F broth is enrichment broth and Deoxycholate agar is selective media for the isolation of Salmonella and Shigella. Option B. Gram Negative broth is enrichment broth used for the isolation of Shigella. Option C. In option C, Monsur\u2019s taurocholate tellurite Peptone water is used for Vibrio but Deoxycholate agar is used to isolate Shigella. So Option C is also incorrect.</p>\n<p></p>",

Step 2: Adhesion to intestinal epithelium facilitated by type IV fimbria called a toxin-regulated pilus. Step 3: Cholera toxin (CT) is produced which consists of 2 fragments- A and B Option: B. Step3: Fragment B of CT binds to GM1 ganglioside receptors on intestinal epithelium and results in internalization of fragment A. Option: D. Step 5: CAMP inhibits the absorptive sodium transport system in villus cells and activates the secretory chloride transport system in crypt cells, which leads to the accumulation of sodium chloride in the intestinal lumen and passive loss of water ithe nto intestinal lumen to maintain osmolality. This results in accumulation of isotonic fluid and watery diarrhoea.
