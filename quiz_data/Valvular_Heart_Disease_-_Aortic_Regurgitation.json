Medial Degeneration with ascending aorta aneurysm/dissection is seen. Coarctation of the aorta is infrequent. Syphilis and ankylosing spondylitis, both of which affect the aortic leaflets , can also have cellular infiltration and scarring of the media of the thoracic aorta, leading to aortic dilation, aneurysm formation, and severe regurgitation. A high-velocity systolic jet that often leads to thickening and scarring of the aortic valve leaflets can be seen in Membranous Subaortic Stenosis , which can cause Secondary AR Rheumatic disease results in thickening, deformity, and shortening of the individual aortic valve cusps, changes that prevent their proper opening during systole and closure during diastole.

In the case of Aortic Dissection involving Ascending Aorta, Acute severe AR is seen in patients.

Typically, the patient starts with High Pitched Decrescendo Early Diastolic Murmur heard best in the third intercostal space along the left sternal border, which INCREASES in duration as the disease progresses and becomes HOLO-DIASTOLIC murmur.

Soft, Low Pitched, Rumbling Mid-Late Diastolic Murmur which is called Austin Flint Murmur Option: C. Mid Systolic Ejection Murmur is also found in AR and is best heard at the apex. Option: D.

A mid-systolic ejection murmur is frequently audible. It is due to increased LV Pressure. In Patients with severe AR, the Austin Flint murmur, which is a soft, low-pitched, rumbling mid-to-late diastolic murmur, is noted. It is produced by the diastolic displacement of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve by the AR stream The auscultatory features of AR are intensified by strenuous and sustained handgrip, which augments systemic vascular resistance and increases LV afterload</p>\n<p></p>",
