Adenosine normally accumulates during waking hours , promoting sleepiness.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mechanism of Caffeine: Caffeine acts as an adenosine receptor antagonist , primarily on A1 and A2A receptors in the brain, reducing drowsiness. Role of Adenosine : Promotes sleepiness by slowing down neuronal activity , especially in regions like the basal forebrain . Impact on Sleep : Consuming caffeine close to bedtime can delay sleep onset and reduce total sleep duration , affecting sleep quality. Caffeine\u2019s Half-life : Average is 3-5 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A . Incorrect, caffeine does affect sleep , and consuming it near bedtime can cause insomnia. Option: B . The locus coeruleus is involved in wakefulness, but caffeine does not cause direct chemical release from it. Option: C . Caffeine does not work through histaminic action in the brain.</p>\n<p></p>",
