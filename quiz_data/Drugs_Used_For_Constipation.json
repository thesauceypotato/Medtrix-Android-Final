It prevents the growth of bacteria by inhibiting their protein synthesis. Erythromycin binds to the 23s rRNA molecule in the 50S ribosomal subunit. Binding site near the peptidyltransferase center. This binding blocks thee exit of the growing peptide thus inhibiting the translocation of the peptides.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Lubiprostone Reason- Lubiprostone is a prokinetic drug that acts in the small intestine. Several agents, commonly called laxatives, can stimulate intestinal motility in nonspecific or indirect ways, but the term prokinetic generally is reserved for agents that enhance intestinal transit through interaction with specific receptors. Lubiprostone is a prostaglandin E1 derivative that appears to bind to prostaglandin E4 receptors linked to the activation of adenylyl cyclase. This in turn can open specific type 2 chloride channels in the luminal cells of the intestinal epithelium, increasing chloride-rich fluid secretion into the intestine. Clinically, lubiprostone alters stool consistency and promotes regular bowel movements. Signs and symptoms related to constipation, including abdominal bloating, abdominal discomfort, stool consistency, and straining, are improved, and long-term data suggest a sustained response over a 6- to 12-month treatment period.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Antiemetic Drugs: Mechanisms of Action Category Mechanism of Action Anticholinergics Block ACh receptors in the vestibular nuclei and reticular formation Antihistamines Block H, receptors, thereby preventing ACh from binding to receptors in the vestibular nuclei Antidopaminergics Block dopamine in the CTZ and may also block Ach Neurokinin receptor antagonists Inhibit the substance P-neurokinin receptors Prokinetics Block dopamine in the CTZ or stimulate ACh receptors in the GI tract Serotonin blockers Block serotonin receptors in the GI tract, CTZ, and VC Tetrahydrocannabinoids Have inhibitory effects on the reticular formation, thalamus, and cerebral cortex ACH, Acetylcholine; CTZ, chemoreceptor trigger zone; VC, vomiting center.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Ondansetron - is used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and SX. Option: B. Dronabino l- it is used to increase appetite in patients with acquired immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and also used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting Option: D. Metoclopramid e- anti-sickness medicine used to treat nausea and vomiting, it has a prokinetic effect.</p>\n<p></p>",
