(INICET NOV 2022) Phlebitis is the most common complication associated with peripheral venous access. Flushing with isotonic saline and heparin can maintain patency in both central and peripheral venous catheters. If an arteriovenous fistula is present in a limb, peripheral venous access should be avoided in that same limb.

It is characterized by a combination of infection, low blood pressure (hypotension), and organ dysfunction. Here are some key points about septic shock:</li><li>\u27a4 Infection : Septic shock typically begins with an infection, often caused by bacteria, but it can also result from fungal or viral infections. Common sources of infection include lung infections (pneumonia), urinary tract infections, abdominal infections, and skin infections. Systemic Inflammatory Response : In response to the infection, the body's immune system initiates a widespread inflammatory response. This response can become dysregulated, leading to an exaggerated release of inflammatory molecules (cytokines) into the bloodstream. Hypotension : One of the hallmark features of septic shock is low blood pressure (hypotension). The inflammation and vasodilation caused by the infection can lead to a drop in blood pressure, which can result in inadequate blood flow to vital organs. Organ Dysfunction : As blood pressure drops and organs receive less oxygen and nutrients, multiple organ systems can begin to fail. This can lead to dysfunction in the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, and other organs. Organ dysfunction is a critical component of septic shock and contributes to its high mortality rate. Symptoms : Symptoms of septic shock can include fever or hypothermia (low body temperature), rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, confusion, altered mental status, and signs of organ dysfunction such as respiratory distress, kidney failure, or liver dysfunction. Treatment : The treatment of septic shock is a medical emergency and involves aggressive interventions. It typically includes antibiotics to treat the underlying infection, intravenous fluids to maintain blood pressure, vasopressor medications to constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure, and supportive care in an intensive care unit (ICU).</li><li>\u27a4 Infection : Septic shock typically begins with an infection, often caused by bacteria, but it can also result from fungal or viral infections.

It has some degree of H1 blocking property also. It is therefore known as NSSA (Nor adrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressant).
