Amyloid precursor protein (APP): Mutations in the APP gene can lead to the early development of Alzheimer's disease, particularly in familial forms. These mutations result in an increased production of amyloid-beta plaques, which are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. APP mutations are one of the most well-established genetic causes of early-onset Alzheimer's.</li><li>\u2022 C. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE): While the ApoE \u03b54 allele is more commonly associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, the ApoE \u03b52 allele is associated with a reduced risk. ApoE is involved in lipid metabolism and has a key role in the clearance of amyloid-beta plaques from the brain. However, ApoE is generally not associated with early-onset Alzheimer's as strongly as other genes like APP or presenilin, but it still plays a role in disease progression.</li><li>\u2022 D. Presenilin-1: Mutations in the presenilin-1 gene (PSEN1) are one of the most common causes of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. These mutations lead to abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which results in the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
