      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>He can inform the judge about it CONDUCT MONEY : It is the fee offered or paid to a witness in civil cases, at the time of serving the summons to meet the expenses for attending the Court. If the fee is not paid, or if he feels that the amount is less, the doctor can bring this fact to the notice of the Judge before giving evidence in the Court. The Judge will decide the amount to be paid. In criminal cases, no fee is paid to the witness at the time of serving the summons. He must attend the Court and give evidence because of the interest of the State in securing justice; otherwise, he will be charged with contempt of Court. However, in criminal cases, conveyance charges and daily allowance can be claimed by the doctor according to Government rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option B : He has to inform the judge and not the lawyer about his grievance Option C : He may get an increment in the fees if his grievance is felt genuine by the judge Option D : The conduct money is not fixed.

If there is time, the Executive magistrate should be called to record the declaration. Before recording the statement. The doctor should certify that the person is conscious and his mental faculties are normal (compos mentis). If the condition of the victim is serious, and there is no time to call a Magistrate, the doctor should take the declaration in the presence of two witnesses. Option: C. The statement can also be recorded by the village headman, police or any other person, but its evidential value will be less. While recording the dying declaration, the oath is not administered, because of the belief that the dying person tells the truth. Statement: The statement should be recorded in the man's own words, without any alteration of terms or phrases. Option: D. Leading questions should not be put. The declarant should be permitted to give his statement without any undue influence, outside prompting or assistance. If a point is not clear, a question may be asked to make it clear, but the actual question and the answer received should be recorded. It should then be read over to the declarant, and his signature or thumb impression is taken. The statement made must be of fact and not opinion. If the declaration is made in the form of an opinion or conclusion, questions should be asked by the recorder to bring out the facts that are the basis for the conclusion. While recording the statement, if the declarant becomes unconscious, the person recording it must record as much information as he has obtained and sign it. If the dying person is unable to speak but is able to make signs in answer to questions put to him, this can be recorded and it is considered as a \"verbal statement\". The doctor and the witness should also sign the declaration. If the statement is written by the declarant himself, it should be signed by him, the doctor and the witnesses.</p>\n<p></p>",

Whoever, being legally bound by an oath, or by an express provision of law to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any statement which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, is said to give false evidence (S.l91 and 192, I.P.C. 344, Cr.P.C.).

Examination-in-chief (direct examination) (S.137, I.E.A.): This is the first examination of a witness.

In criminal acts committed by an individual or group, the State becomes a party instead of the aggrieved person, and starts criminal prosecution, which is titled \"State versus A\". Option: C.

The doctor should help the prosecutor in framing proper questions in proper sequence so that all essential facts are elicited. Option: D. In a criminal trial, the burden to prove is always on the prosecution (adversarial system of trial). and the accused is presumed to be innocent till the contrary is proved against him. In Government prosecution cases. the public prosecutor first examines the witness (S.24 and 25 Cr.P.C.). If a witness is called by a private party. He is first examined by the lawyer of that party. The object is to elicit all relevant, convincing medical facts (S.l38, I.E.A.). and the conclusions that the doctor has drawn from the facts. The doctor may have to interpret the findings of non-medical ancillary investigations provided by scientific laboratories, analysts and serologists, in all cases where the medical aspects are at issue. Before giving evidence, it is advisable that the doctor meets the public prosecutor, and discuss the previously prepared report, the certificate of death, photographs, etc., that the witness intends to show in the Court, and an outline or pattern should be worked out for the best way to elicit his testimony. The lawyer will be able to advise the doctor on the matters that he will attempt to emphasize and about the anticipated content of cross-examination.</p>\n<p></p>",
