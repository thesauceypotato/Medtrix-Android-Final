Fibrous pericardium is capable of some change in shape, it is largely non-pliable, which acts to protect the heart against blunt forces and sudden pressure change from the outside. Option B. Apex lies at sternal angle level The apex is blunt and lies at the level of the sternal angle.(Option B). The fibrous pericardium is a conical-shaped sac. Its apex is fused with the roots of the great vessels at the base of the heart . Its broad base overlies the central fibrous area of the diaphragm with which it is fused. Option C.

Anteriorly, it is connected to the upper and lower ends of the body of the sternum by superior and inferior sternopericardial ligaments. Posteriorly, it is related to the principal bronchi, the esophagus with the nerve plexus around it and the descending thoracic aorta.

The serous pericardium , is divided into two parts: Parietal serous pericardium, which lines the interior side of the superficial portion of the pericardial sac, is fused to and inseparable from the fibrous pericardium Visceral serous pericardium, also known as the epicardium, covers the myocardium of the heart and can be considered its serosa.

Two layers are not continuous with each other The two layers are continuous with each other at the roots of the great vessels, i.e., ascending aorta, pulmonary trunk, two venae cava, and four pulmonary veins. (OPTION C) Option D. There is no potential space between two layers of Serous pericardium The pericardial cavity is a potential space between the parietal pericardium and the visceral pericardium.

At the roots of great vessels, the epicardium reflects back and continues as the parietal pericardium, forming an enclosed pericardial sac.

Pain of pericarditis originates in the parietal pericardium alone while cardiac pain or angina originates in the cardiac muscle or in the vessels of the heart. Pain of pericarditis originates in the parietal pericardium alone. P ericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, the fibrous sac surrounding the heart. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp chest pain, which may also be felt in the shoulders, neck, or back. The pain is typically less severe when sitting up and more severe when lying down or breathing deeply. Other symptoms of pericarditis can include fever, weakness, palpitations, and shortness of breath.
