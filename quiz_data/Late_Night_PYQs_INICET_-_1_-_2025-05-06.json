B) Uterine contractility is mediated by innervations from level T7 - T8</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The incorrect statement regarding the innervation of the uterus is option B. Uterine contractility is primarily mediated by hormonal mechanisms rather than by specific spinal innervations. Hormones such as estrogen, prostaglandins, and oxytocin play a significant role in inducing uterine contractions, while progesterone helps maintain uterine relaxation.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Sensory level is from T10 to L1: The sensory innervation of the uterus is indeed from spinal levels T10 to L1. These afferent fibers enter the spinal cord via the inferior hypogastric plexus and are responsible for transmitting sensory information from the uterus.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Sensory level is from T10 to L1:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. In the 1st stage of labor, pain is due to the fibers at level of T10 - L1: During the 1st stage of labor, pain is mediated by spinal segments T10 to L1. This pain is due to the distension of the cervix and lower uterine segment, as well as the contraction of the uterus.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. In the 1st stage of labor, pain is due to the fibers at level of T10 - L1:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. In early labor, pain is usually because of the uterine contraction: In early labor, pain is usually related to uterine contractions, which stimulate nociceptors in the genital tract and can cause discomfort and pain.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. In early labor, pain is usually because of the uterine contraction:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Uterine contractility is not mediated by innervations from spinal level T7 - T8; instead, it is primarily influenced by hormonal mechanisms.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Page 500, DC Dutta\u2019s Textbook of Obstetrics, 8 th edition</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Page 500, DC Dutta\u2019s Textbook of Obstetrics, 8 th edition</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

One of the notable side effects of clofazimine is skin pigmentation changes, which can manifest as hyperpigmentation. This occurs because clofazimine accumulates in the skin, leading to discoloration. The pigmentation typically appears as a reddish or brownish coloration and can be distressing for patients due to its noticeable cosmetic impact. The pigmentation is long-lasting and may take several months to years to fade after discontinuation of the drug.</li><li>\u2022 Clofazimine is an antimicrobial agent used primarily in the treatment of leprosy.</li><li>\u2022 One of the notable side effects of clofazimine is skin pigmentation changes, which can manifest as hyperpigmentation.</li><li>\u2022 This occurs because clofazimine accumulates in the skin, leading to discoloration.</li><li>\u2022 The pigmentation typically appears as a reddish or brownish coloration and can be distressing for patients due to its noticeable cosmetic impact.</li><li>\u2022 The pigmentation is long-lasting and may take several months to years to fade after discontinuation of the drug.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

It is caused by the hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the Pylorus, which results in constriction and obstruction of the gastric outlet. First-born male infants are at the highest risk for developing CHPS. Projectile, non-bilious vomiting is a common symptom in infants with CHPS. A palpable olive-shaped mass is usually felt in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, and visible peristalsis can be observed moving from left to right, followed by projectile vomiting. Infants with CHPS develop a characteristic metabolic abnormality including hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria. Loss of hydrochloric acid leads to metabolic alkalosis and hypochloremia due to persistent vomiting. The kidneys try to compensate for alkalosis by secreting Na+ and HCO3, but the loss of sodium stimulates aldosterone secretion leading to the loss of potassium ions (hypokalemia). Loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH resulting in paradoxical aciduria. Treatment involves rehydration and correction of metabolic abnormalities before surgery, and the Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is the standard surgical procedure for CHPS.</li><li>\u27a4 CHPS (congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis) is most commonly seen in infants between 2 to 8 weeks of age.</li><li>\u27a4 It is caused by the hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the Pylorus, which results in constriction and obstruction of the gastric outlet.</li><li>\u27a4 First-born male infants are at the highest risk for developing CHPS.</li><li>\u27a4 Projectile, non-bilious vomiting is a common symptom in infants with CHPS.</li><li>\u27a4 A palpable olive-shaped mass is usually felt in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, and visible peristalsis can be observed moving from left to right, followed by projectile vomiting.</li><li>\u27a4 Infants with CHPS develop a characteristic metabolic abnormality including hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria.</li><li>\u27a4 Loss of hydrochloric acid leads to metabolic alkalosis and hypochloremia due to persistent vomiting.</li><li>\u27a4 The kidneys try to compensate for alkalosis by secreting Na+ and HCO3, but the loss of sodium stimulates aldosterone secretion leading to the loss of potassium ions (hypokalemia).</li><li>\u27a4 Loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH resulting in paradoxical aciduria.</li><li>\u27a4 Treatment involves rehydration and correction of metabolic abnormalities before surgery, and the Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is the standard surgical procedure for CHPS.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
