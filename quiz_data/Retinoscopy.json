      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The slit lamp shows thickening of the cornea and often folds of the Descemet's membrane and an immune ring of the Wessely type The given case points towards the diagnosis of interstitial keratitis most probably as a manifestation of Cogan\u2019s syndrome . Cogan syndrome: Interstitial keratitis and deafness (Cogan syndrome) is a rare disease affecting young adults. The keratitis is associated with vertigo, tinnitus and deafness. This describes disciform keratitis. This disease is characterized by the gradual appearance of a central grey disc lying in the middle layers of the stroma, usually with a denser central opacity.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The slit lamp shows thickening of the cornea and often folds of the Descemet\u2019s membrane and an immune ring of the Wessely type.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. After slight irritative symptoms with some ciliary congestion, one or more hazy patches appear in the deep layers of the cornea near the margin or towards the centre. If they start near the margin, they migrate towards the centre, until finally, the whole cornea looks lustreless and dull. In 2\u20134 weeks, the whole cornea is hazy with a steamy surface , giving a general ground glass appearance in which denser spots can always be seen. After the disease has reached its peak, the cornea clears slowly from the margin towards the centre, which may remain hazy for a long time but finally improves except in the worst cases. Option: B. Interstitial keratitis due to inherited syphilis most commonly affects children between the ages of 5 and 15 years. Diagnosis of interstitial keratitis depends on other evidence of congenital syphilis and positive serological reactions. Due to the pediatric age of this patient and syphilis being one of the most common causes of interstitial keratitis, the clinician should make a point to rule out the effect of inherited syphilis. Option: C. It is doubtful if antisyphilitic remedies have any influence over the course of the keratitis, partly because the cornea is nonvascular and partly because the reaction is probably largely allergic. It is possible, however, that intensive systemic treatment with penicillin may shorten the course of the disease. Local treatment in the form of lubricants, topical steroids and cycloplegics to control the uveitis is helpful in the acute stage. In the later stages , the best results are obtained by corneal grafting of the penetrating type , which generally has a good prognosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Cogan syndrome. This consists of interstitial keratitis, vertigo and hearing loss. The interstitial keratitis usually begins in the peripheral cornea with round, white stromal opacities. It is important to recognize this diagnosis because early treatment with systemic corticosteroids may prevent permanent hearing loss. Approximately 10% of patients with Cogan syndrome have evidence of a systemic vasculitis. (Source: From Jay H. Krachmer, David A. Palay, eds. Cornea Atlas. 3rd ed.
