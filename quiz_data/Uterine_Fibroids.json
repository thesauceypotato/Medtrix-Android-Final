By disturbances in ovulation. By interfering with the implantation of the fertilized ovum. The pregnancy rate following a myomectomy is 40%. During Pregnancy: Abortion, placental abruption, and premature labor occur when fibroid interferes with the enlargement of the uterus, initiates abnormal uterine contractions, or prevents efficient placentation. Malposition and Malpresentation of the fetus: Occur as fibroid can prevent engagement of head. Obstructed labor: It can be caused by cervical and broad ligament tumors which are fixed in the pelvis and by pedunculated subserosal leiomyomas which become trapped in the pouch of Douglas. During Labor: If the fibroid is situated above the presenting part: uneventful vaginal delivery. If the fibroid is situated below the presenting part: a trial for vaginal delivery should be given.
