Assuming that the inulin was distributed evenly between the intravascular (IV) and interstitial fluid (ISF) compartments and that the patient is in a steady state. GFR = (Uin x V) / Pin where Uin is the urinary concentration of inulin, V is the urine flow rate, and Pin is the plasma concentration of inulin. Since the patient is undergoing dialysis, we can assume that her urine flow rate is negligible . Therefore, the equation can be simplified as: GFR = Uin / Pin Given that the patient received 0.20 g of inulin, and the plasma concentration of inulin after an hour was 1.5 g/100 mL, we can calculate the GFR as: GFR = Uin / Pin = 0.20 g / (1.5 g/100 mL) = 13.3 mL/min Therefore the correct answer is option A. 13.3 ml/min.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Inulin is a polysaccharide that is filtered by the glomerulus of the kidney and is neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the renal tubules.

Pheochromocytomas are situated in the adrenal medulla or in the abdomen near the celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric ganglia (sympathetic ganglia). It occurs at all ages but is common at a young age. It is more common in females. There is labile hypertension, and anxiety attacks. There is headache, excessive sweating and palpitations. There may be a pain in the chest and abdomen, with nausea and vomiting. There may be sudden flushing. Pheochromocytoma is usually suggested by the history of in a symptomatic patient, the discovery of an incidental adrenal mass, or the family history of a patient with the familial disease. Sometimes it is detected incidentally.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Options B, C, and D: hyperglycaemia, palpitations, and vasoconstriction are all adrenergic symptoms that are typically for patients with pheochromocytoma and are reduced by removing the tumor. These symptoms won\u2019t improve by perioperative fluids and salt loading.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The adrenal medulla secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine in response to sympathetic nervous system stimulation A tumor here, called pheochromocytoma can produce uncontrolled secretions of catecholamines and therefore increases the sympathetic innervation of all organ systems.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>10L Assuming that the dye is distributed uniformly throughout the fluid compartment, we can use the following formula to calculate the volume of fluid: Amount of substance = Concentration x Volume Initially, the patient was given 1000 mg of the dye and assuming it was evenly distributed in the fluid compartment, we can write: 1000 mg = C1 x V where C1 is the initial concentration of the dye. After the patient excreted 10% of the dye, the concentration of the dye in the fluid compartment decreased to 90 mg/L. Therefore, we can write: 10 x 1000 mg = (C1 - 90 mg/L) x V Simplifying this equation, we get: 100 mg = (C1 - 90 mg/L) x V We can now substitute the first equation into the second equation to eliminate C1, and solve for V: 100 mg = [(1000 mg / V) - 90 mg/L] x V 100 mg = 1000 mg - 90 mg/L x V 90 mg/L x V = 900 mg V = 10 L Therefore, the volume of fluid in the patient is estimated to be 10 liters.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Rest options are not correct because Volume = amount of dye-amount excreted/concentration Volume = 1000 mg-10 mg/90 mg per L Volume = 900 mg/90 mg per L =10L Therefore, the correct option would be only B.</p>\n<p></p>",

The distribution of extracellular and intracellular water is a function of extracellular osmolality.
