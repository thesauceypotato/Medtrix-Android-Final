Common Peroneal nerve The most common presentation with common peroneal nerve injury or palsy is acute foot drop.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The common peroneal nerve is the smaller and terminal branch of the sciatic nerve which is composed of the posterior divisions of L4, 5, S1, 2. It courses along the upper lateral side of the popliteal fossa, deep to biceps femoris and its tendon until it gets to the posterior part of the head of the fibula. It passes forwards around the neck of the fibula within the substance of fibularis (peroneus) longus, where it terminates by dividing into the superficial and deep fibular (peroneal) nerves.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Femoral nerve is a mixed nerve of the lower limb that innervates the muscles and skin of the hip and thigh. The femoral nerve originates from the lumbar plexus The femoral nerve is split by the lateral circumflex femoral artery into an anterior and posterior division. Option: C. Sural nerve has its origins within the sciatic nerve, coming from terminal branches of the tibial and common fibular nerves Directly innervates the skin over the posterolateral aspect of the distal third of the leg. Option: D. Tibial nerve Tibial nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve, and arises at the apex of the popliteal fossa. It travels through the popliteal fossa, giving off branches to muscles in the superficial posterior compartment of the leg. The tibial nerve continues its course down the leg, posterior to the tibia. During its descent, it supplies the deep muscles of the posterior leg.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The Common peroneal nerve can be palpated behind the head of the fibula and as it winds around the neck of the fibula. The common fibular (peroneal) nerve gives articular branches to the knee and superior tibiofibular joint. The lateral cutaneous nerve of the calf supplies the posterolateral side of the proximal two-thirds of the leg. It usually arises in common with the fibular (peroneal) communicating branch which joins the sural nerve in the middle third of the leg.</p>\n<p></p>",
