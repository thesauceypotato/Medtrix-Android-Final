D) Do CA-125 levels, if normal advise regular check up</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The next best step in managing a postmenopausal woman with a small (3 x 3 cm) smooth ovarian cyst is to measure CA-125 levels. CA-125 is a tumor marker used to assess the risk of ovarian cancer, especially in postmenopausal women. Given the benign characteristics of the cyst on ultrasound and the small size, the initial step is to evaluate CA-125 levels:</li><li>\u2022 CA-125 Levels: If the CA-125 levels are normal (less than 35), the patient can be advised to have regular follow-ups. Regular Follow-ups: If CA-125 levels are normal, a transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) should be repeated in 6-12 weeks to monitor the cyst. If the cyst persists but remains benign, yearly TVS is recommended.</li><li>\u2022 CA-125 Levels: If the CA-125 levels are normal (less than 35), the patient can be advised to have regular follow-ups.</li><li>\u2022 CA-125 Levels:</li><li>\u2022 Regular Follow-ups: If CA-125 levels are normal, a transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) should be repeated in 6-12 weeks to monitor the cyst.
