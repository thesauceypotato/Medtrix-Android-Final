CMV is a member of the herpesvirus family and can cause opportunistic infections in individuals with weakened immune systems.

Heparin is a Hapten, e. an incomplete antigen, and when it combines with Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) , it becomes a complete antigen and can lead to the formation of antibodies. PF4 usually is present on the platelet surface . The antibody then combines with this Heparin-PF4 complex on the platelet surface. This is followed by fibrin binding to this complex and forming a clot . This effect on platelets and endothelial damage induced by antibody binding combine to produce a prothrombotic state , even in the face of heparin administration and low platelet counts (as platelets are deposited in the thrombus thus formed).

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique used in molecular biology to amplify a single copy or a few copies of a segment of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence.

The encoded protein is rich in hydrophobic amino acids such as glycine and proline, which form mobile hydrophobic regions bounded by crosslinks between lysine residues. Abnormality in elastin protein can lead to abnormality in many systems Aortic aneurysm, joint laxity, and subluxation of lens.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Alcian blue Alcian blue is a special stain commonly used to detect and visualize acidic mucins in tissues. Acidic mucins are a type of glycoprotein that contains sialic acid and sulfate residues. When tissues are stained with Alcian blue, it selectively binds to acidic mucins, resulting in a blue or turquoise color. This staining technique is particularly useful in identifying mucin-producing cells and structures, such as goblet cells in the gastrointestinal tract or mucous glands in respiratory tissues.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A .PAS: This (Periodic Acid-Schiff) stain is used to detect carbohydrates and glycoproteins, but it is not specific to acidic mucins. Option C .GMS : This (Gomori Methenamine Silver) stain is used to detect fungal organisms Option D .Masson trichrome: This  stain is used for the differentiation of collagen, muscle fibers, and cytoplasm in tissues.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Stains in pathology Stains Use Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) General staining of nuclei (hematoxylin) and cytoplasm (eosin) for routine histology.
