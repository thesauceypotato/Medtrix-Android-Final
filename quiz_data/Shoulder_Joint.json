The sequence of muscles from starting to overhead abduction i.e. from 0 degrees to >90 degrees involved are the following muscles in sequence. Supraspinatus- from 0-15 degrees. Anterior fibres of deltoid- 15- 90 degrees. Serratus anterior and trapezius (upper and lower fibres)- overhead abduction. Also, the rotation of the scapula helps in overhead abduction.
