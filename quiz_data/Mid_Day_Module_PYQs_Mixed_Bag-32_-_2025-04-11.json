It is effective for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, which is hormone-dependent. Tamoxifen works by blocking the effects of estrogen in the breast tissue, thereby preventing cancer cells from growing and spreading.</li><li>\u2022 Mechanism of Action : Tamoxifen competes with estrogen for binding to estrogen receptors in breast tissue. By blocking estrogen's effects, it inhibits the growth and proliferation of estrogen-dependent cancer cells. Administration : Tamoxifen is taken orally, usually once a day for five years. Side Effects : Common side effects include hot flashes, mood changes, vaginal dryness, and an increased risk of blood clots (DVT).</li><li>\u2022 Mechanism of Action : Tamoxifen competes with estrogen for binding to estrogen receptors in breast tissue.

This deficiency, known as scurvy, involves various skeletal changes including defective osteoid matrix formation and osteolysis, beyond just the commonly noted bleeding gums. The combined symptoms of bowing of legs and bleeding gums can indeed suggest a scenario where vitamin C deficiency plays a contributory role alongside other deficiencies like vitamin D.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.
