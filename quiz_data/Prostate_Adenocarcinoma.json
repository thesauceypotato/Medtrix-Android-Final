      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Architectural patterns The Gleason score in prostate cancer is determined by evaluating the architectural patterns observed in the tumour tissue. The higher the Gleason score, the more aggressive and poorly differentiated the prostate cancer cells are considered to be. It helps in determining the prognosis and guiding treatment decisions for patients with prostate cancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Prostatic adenocarcinoma Common in males >50 years old Arises from the peripheral zone or posterior lobe of the prostate Tumour marker: Prostatic acid phosphatase and PSA PSA: Increased total PSA, with a decreased fraction of free PSA Metastasis: Osteoblastic metastasis in the spine (most often which occurs via Bastson venous plexus ) Histologically graded with Gleason grade which is based on glandular architecture</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Tumor size: Tumor size is not directly assessed or considered when determining the Gleason score in prostate cancer. Option: B. Lymph node involvement: Lymph node involvement is not directly assessed when determining the Gleason score. Option: C. Mitotic activity: While mitotic activity is an important factor in assessing the aggressiveness of tumours in general, it is not specifically used to determine the Gleason score in prostate cancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Prostate-zones</p>\n<p></p>",
