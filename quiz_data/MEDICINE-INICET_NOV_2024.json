It commonly follows a gastrointestinal infection, particularly with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), such as E. coli O157:H7, often due to contaminated food, especially undercooked meat. The Shiga toxin damages endothelial cells, leading to microvascular injury, platelet aggregation, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. This results in decreased platelet counts, damaged red blood cells, and impaired kidney function, manifesting as hematuria, oliguria, or even acute renal failure. Although HUS is most common in young children, it can also affect adults. Treatment primarily focuses on supportive care, including hydration and managing renal function, while severe cases may require dialysis. Early detection and intervention are crucial for better outcomes. Typical HUS (90%) Atypical HUS (10% of cases) Usually involves diarrhea May or may not involve diarrhea Primarily affects infants, small children Can affect children or adults Associated with Shiga toxin May be familial or sporadic Often resolves with supportive care, with recovery of renal function Requires immediate attention to avoid fatality and optimize outcomes</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

Symptoms may include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and fatigue. Extrapulmonary manifestations can involve the skin (e.g., erythema nodosum), eyes (e.g., uveitis), and heart (e.g., arrhythmias or heart failure). Diagnosis is typically based on clinical findings, radiologic evidence, and biopsy showing non-caseating granulomas, often in lymph nodes or lung tissue. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels in pleural fluid are often normal or mildly elevated. Pulmonary function tests and high-resolution CT scans can assess lung involvement. Treatment is generally supportive, with corticosteroids being the mainstay for managing symptomatic disease.

It is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, but other pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae can also be involved. This condition typically arises when pathogens overcome the body\u2019s respiratory defenses, often following viral infections, aspiration, or in individuals with weakened immune systems. The clinical presentation of pyogenic pneumonia includes symptoms such as fever, cough (which may produce purulent sputum), pleuritic chest pain, and difficulty breathing. The severity of these symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on the virulence of the pathogen and the patient's overall health. Tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia are common, and in severe cases, patients may develop septic shock. On physical examination , patients may have signs of consolidation, such as dullness to percussion, bronchial breath sounds, and increased tactile fremitus. The presence of rales or crackles is often noted. Diagnosis is primarily clinical but is confirmed with imaging studies such as a chest X-ray or CT scan, which typically reveal localized areas of consolidation, sometimes with pleural effusion. Sputum cultures and blood cultures help identify the specific causative organism. Treatment of pyogenic pneumonia generally involves antibiotics, with the choice of drugs depending on the suspected pathogen. Beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin or cephalosporins are commonly used for Streptococcus pneumoniae, while methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may require more aggressive therapy with drugs like vancomycin or linezolid. Supportive care, including oxygen therapy and fluids, may be necessary in more severe cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B.

ECG findings supporting ARVD include epsilon waves and arrhythmias.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD) is a rare inherited cardiac disorder characterized by the replacement of right ventricular myocardial tissue with fibrous and fatty tissue, leading to arrhythmias and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. It typically manifests in adolescence or early adulthood, with symptoms like palpitations, syncope, and sometimes sudden cardiac arrest, often triggered by physical activity. The pathophysiology of ARVD involves the replacement of myocardial tissue in the right ventricle with fibrofatty tissue, which causes electrical instability and predisposing the heart to arrhythmias. The disorder primarily affects the right ventricle, but the left ventricle may also be involved in some cases. It is associated with mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins such as plakophilin-2 (PKP2), desmoglein-2 (DSG2), and desmocollin-2 (DSC2), which are important for maintaining cell-cell junctions in the myocardium. ECG Findings : In ARVD, ECG abnormalities are typically seen, especially in more advanced stages of the disease. These may include: Epsilon waves: Small positive deflections at the end of the QRS complex, seen most prominently in the right precordial leads (V1-V3). This is a classic finding in ARVD. Ventricular arrhythmias: These include premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and potentially polymorphic VT. T-wave inversions: Often seen in the right precordial leads (V1-V3), particularly in the setting of arrhythmias. Prolonged S-wave upstroke: This can be seen in leads V1-V2. QRS fragmentation: A fragmented QRS complex may be observed in some patients. Diagnosis is made based on clinical criteria, imaging studies, and genetic testing. Imaging techniques such as echocardiography and MRI reveal right ventricular dilation, wall motion abnormalities, and fibrofatty infiltration. The Padua and task force criteria are used to assess the severity and make the diagnosis based on clinical signs, family history, arrhythmias, imaging, and biopsy results. Treatment involves managing arrhythmias and preventing sudden cardiac death. Antiarrhythmic drugs like beta-blockers and amiodarone may be used, but high-risk patients often require an Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD). Lifestyle changes, such as avoiding strenuous physical activity, are crucial in preventing arrhythmias. In severe cases, a heart transplant may be necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Uhl's disease : A rare congenital disorder involving right ventricular myocardial thinning but without the fibrofatty replacement seen in ARVD. It typically presents with arrhythmias but is less likely to present with syncopal attacks triggered by exercise. Option: C. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy : This condition can present with syncope and arrhythmias, but it typically involves the left ventricle with thickened myocardial walls and does not show the fibrofatty replacement seen in ARVD. The ECG would typically show signs of left ventricular hypertrophy or abnormal repolarization rather than the findings seen in ARVD. Option: D. Bragada\u2019s syndrome : This is a genetic arrhythmia syndrome that can lead to syncope and sudden cardiac arrest, typically due to a specific pattern of ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads (V1-V3). However, it\u2019s not typically triggered by exercise and is less likely to present with fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium seen in ARVD.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Cardiomyopathies: Feature Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (RCM) Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD) Etiology Often idiopathic, viral infections, genetics, alcohol, drugs Genetic (autosomal dominant), mutations in sarcomere genes Amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, endomyocardial fibrosis, idiopathic Genetic (desmosomal protein mutations), exercise triggers Chamber Involvement Mainly left ventricle, sometimes both ventricles Left ventricle (asymmetric hypertrophy, typically septal) Primarily left and/or right ventricles, with rigid walls Right ventricle (sometimes left ventricle) Heart Size Enlarged chambers, especially the left ventricle Normal or slightly enlarged, with hypertrophied myocardium Normal or mildly dilated ventricles but stiff walls Right ventricle dilation, fatty infiltration Myocardial Changes Myocyte dilation, thinning of walls, fibrosis Myocyte disarray, hypertrophy, fibrosis Fibrosis, infiltration of abnormal substances (e.g., amyloid) Fibrofatty infiltration, myocyte loss in the right ventricle ECG Findings Low voltage QRS, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities Deep Q waves, T-wave inversions, arrhythmias, left ventricular hypertrophy Low voltage QRS, ST-T changes, conduction disturbances Epsilon waves, T-wave inversions, QRS fragmentation, arrhythmias Symptoms Fatigue, shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, edema Syncope, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath Dyspnea, fatigue, peripheral edema, signs of heart failure Palpitations, syncope, sudden cardiac arrest, especially post-exercise Most Common Presentation Heart failure, arrhythmias Syncope, arrhythmias (especially with exertion) Heart failure, restrictive symptoms Palpitations, exercise-induced arrhythmias, syncope Management ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics, ICD, heart transplant Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, septal myectomy, ICD Diuretics, heart transplant, treatment of underlying cause Beta-blockers, ICD, exercise restriction, antiarrhythmic drugs</p>\n<p></p>",

In ischemic stroke, BP should be reduced to <140/90 mmHg immediately. In ischemic stroke, aggressive BP reduction is typically not recommended unless there are complications, as higher BP can help maintain blood flow to ischemic brain tissue. In contrast, in hemorrhagic stroke, BP should be reduced to <160/100 mmHg to prevent rebleeding, and aggressive treatment is warranted if the systolic BP exceeds 220 mmHg.

There are two main types: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic stroke, the most common type, occurs when a blood clot or plaque blocks a blood vessel, leading to a lack of oxygen and nutrients in the affected area of the brain. This can result from atherosclerosis, embolism (blood clots from other parts of the body), or other factors that reduce blood flow. Hemorrhagic stroke , on the other hand, occurs when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, causing bleeding and increased pressure on the brain. This can result from conditions like high blood pressure, aneurysms, or arteriovenous malformations. The clinical presentation of a stroke often includes sudden onset of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, speech difficulties, confusion, visual disturbances, and loss of coordination or balance. In severe cases, stroke can lead to altered consciousness or even death. Diagnosis is made primarily through neuroimaging, such as CT or MRI, to distinguish between ischemic and hemorrhagic causes. Treatment strategies differ based on the type of stroke. In ischemic stroke, the focus is on restoring blood flow, which may involve thrombolytic therapy (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator, tPA) or mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions. In hemorrhagic stroke, the goal is to control bleeding and reduce intracranial pressure, often requiring surgical intervention or the use of antihypertensive medications to manage blood pressure. Both types of stroke require prompt medical intervention to minimize brain damage and improve outcomes.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A . In hemorrhagic stroke, reduce the BP to less than 160/100 mmHg with antihypertensives to prevent rebleed : This is correct. In hemorrhagic stroke, blood pressure should be controlled, but overly aggressive reduction is not recommended. A target of less than 160/100 mmHg is generally considered safe to prevent further bleeding. Option: B. In hemorrhagic stroke, aggressive use of IV antihypertensive if SBP > 220 : This is correct. In cases of very high blood pressure (SBP > 220 mmHg) in hemorrhagic stroke, aggressive antihypertensive therapy may be required to reduce the risk of rebleeding. Option: C.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>30-44 The correct answer is 30-44. According to the KDIGO classification for chronic kidney disease (CKD), G3b refers to a glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30-44 mL/min/1.73m\u00b2, indicating moderate to severe kidney dysfunction. The stages of CKD are based on eGFR values, with G1 being normal kidney function (eGFR \u2265 90) and G5 representing kidney failure (eGFR < 15).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition characterized by the gradual decline in kidney function over time, which leads to the kidneys' inability to filter waste and maintain fluid and electrolyte balance effectively. CKD can result from a variety of underlying causes, including diabetes, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and prolonged use of certain medications like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The most common causes of CKD are diabetes mellitus and hypertension. In diabetic nephropathy, high blood sugar levels cause damage to the kidney's blood vessels, while in hypertension, the increased pressure can lead to kidney damage over time. Other conditions like glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli) and polycystic kidney disease (an inherited disorder causing cysts to form in the kidneys) can also contribute to CKD development. Age, family history of kidney disease, obesity, smoking, and certain ethnic backgrounds are also known risk factors. In the early stages, CKD may be asymptomatic. As the disease progresses, symptoms may include fatigue, swelling in the legs and ankles, shortness of breath, frequent urination, high blood pressure, and itchiness. Advanced stages of CKD can lead to uremia, which is marked by nausea, vomiting, confusion, and even coma. Anemia, bone disease, and electrolyte imbalances such as hyperkalemia may also be present. CKD is diagnosed through laboratory tests and clinical assessment. Serum creatinine and the calculation of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are essential for assessing kidney function. A decrease in eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73m\u00b2 for three months or longer is diagnostic for CKD. Urine tests are used to check for the presence of protein (proteinuria), which is an early sign of kidney damage. Imaging studies such as ultrasound can be used to evaluate kidney size and structure. Management of CKD focuses on slowing disease progression and treating underlying causes. This involves blood sugar control in diabetes, blood pressure management (typically with ACE inhibitors or ARBs), lipid management, and lifestyle modifications like weight management and smoking cessation. Medications to manage complications like anemia and electrolyte imbalances are also commonly used. In advanced CKD, options like dialysis or kidney transplantation may be required for life-saving treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. 45-59 : This range corresponds to G3a , which is classified as mild to moderate kidney dysfunction, not G3b.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Rise of creatinine by more than 10% is suggestive of acute rejection Acute renal allograft rejection typically manifests as a significant rise in serum creatinine, often greater than 10% above baseline. However, a minor or transient increase in creatinine does not necessarily indicate rejection and may be due to other causes, such as dehydration or drug effects. Hence, a significant rise (usually >10%) is a key indicator of acute rejection.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Renal allograft transplantation is a complex and life-saving procedure performed to treat patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), where both kidneys are no longer functioning adequately. This procedure involves transplanting a healthy kidney from a donor (either living or deceased) into a recipient whose kidneys have failed. The primary goal is to restore normal kidney function, alleviate the need for dialysis, and improve the patient's overall quality of life and survival. Pre-transplantation Process: Before undergoing a renal transplant, the recipient is carefully evaluated through a series of medical tests to assess their overall health, the function of other organs, and the potential risks involved. This includes matching the donor and recipient\u2019s blood type and human leukocyte antigens (HLA), as well as screening for any underlying infections, cardiovascular issues, or cancers. Compatibility between donor and recipient is essential to minimize the risk of organ rejection. The patient\u2019s immune system is also evaluated to assess any potential for antibody-mediated rejection, which can complicate the transplantation process. Donor Sources: Kidneys for transplantation can come from either living or deceased donors. Living donors are typically family members, close friends, or sometimes even strangers, who undergo rigorous testing to ensure they are suitable candidates for donation. Deceased donor kidneys are harvested after the donor has passed away, usually due to a traumatic brain injury or brain death. These kidneys must be carefully preserved during transport to ensure they remain viable for transplant. Immunosuppressive Therapy: After transplantation, patients must take lifelong immunosuppressive medications to prevent their immune system from rejecting the new kidney. These medications, such as calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus ), corticosteroids, and antimetabolites, suppress the immune response but also increase the risk of infections, malignancies, and kidney damage over time. Monitoring drug levels and adjusting dosages are crucial to maintaining a delicate balance between preventing rejection and minimizing side effects. Acute rejection typically presents with a sudden rise in serum creatinine levels, which indicates a decline in kidney function. Biopsy of the transplanted kidney can be performed to confirm rejection and help guide treatment. In contrast, chronic rejection can occur gradually over time, often leading to progressive loss of kidney function despite immune suppression. Other long-term issues include the development of infections, post-transplant malignancies, and the nephrotoxic effects of long-term immunosuppressive therapy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B. A rise of 5% is generally considered too small to strongly indicate acute rejection. Acute rejection usually causes a more significant increase in creatinine, typically greater than 10%. A 5% increase could be due to other non-rejection-related factors, like fluid balance changes or medication effects. Option: C. This is incorrect because serum creatinine does rise in acute rejection. The kidneys' ability to clear creatinine is impaired during rejection, leading to an increase in serum creatinine levels, which is a key indicator of rejection. Option: D. While an increase in creatinine may indicate rejection, any rise is not always due to rejection. Other factors, such as dehydration, infection, or drug nephrotoxicity, can also cause an increase in creatinine. A significant rise (typically more than 10%) is more specific to rejection.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Transplant types:</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Types of Transplant Rejections: Transplant Rejection Type Onset Mechanism & Vessel Histology Type of Hypersensitivity Host vs. Graft\" Hyperacute Immediate Preformed antibodies directed against the donor tissue.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Decreased arterial compliance Decreased arterial compliance occurs as people age, leading to stiffer arteries. This results in a higher systolic pressure (due to less ability of the arteries to expand with blood flow) and a lower diastolic pressure, leading to a reduced pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure). In this patient with a blood pressure of 170/100 mmHg, the pulse pressure is already lower than expected due to reduced arterial compliance associated with aging.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hypertension , characterized by persistently high blood pressure, leads to several physiological changes in the cardiovascular system. Blood pressure is determined by two key factors: cardiac output (CO), the volume of blood the heart pumps per minute, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR), the resistance to blood flow provided by the arterial system. In hypertension, both of these factors can be affected. Increased SVR is a common cause of hypertension, often due to arterial stiffening (e.g., atherosclerosis) or vasoconstriction. When arteries become stiffer, they are less able to expand with each heartbeat, increasing the resistance the heart must overcome to pump blood. This leads to an increased afterload, meaning the heart works harder to pump blood. Over time, the left ventricle may hypertrophy as it adapts to the higher afterload, a condition known as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The renal system also plays a critical role in hypertension. The kidneys normally help regulate blood pressure through fluid balance. However, in hypertension, sodium retention can occur, leading to an increase in blood volume, which further elevates blood pressure. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) may be overactive in some forms of hypertension, causing vasoconstriction and sodium retention, which further raise blood pressure. Sympathetic nervous system activation is another contributor to hypertension. It can lead to increased heart rate and vasoconstriction, both of which elevate blood pressure. Over time, chronic sympathetic activation can contribute to vascular remodeling, making blood vessels more rigid and contributing to further increases in blood pressure. Endothelial dysfunction , a common feature in hypertension, reduces the ability of blood vessels to dilate in response to stimuli, such as exercise or changes in blood flow. This exacerbates the increased resistance and contributes to further elevation in blood pressure. In the long term, these physiological changes can cause damage to vital organs. The heart may eventually fail due to the increased workload, the kidneys may suffer damage leading to chronic kidney disease, and the blood vessels may become more prone to ruptures or blockages, increasing the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (heart attack). Additionally, sustained high blood pressure can lead to aortic aneurysms, retinopathy, and cognitive impairment due to reduced perfusion to the brain.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B.

Option: D.

Insulin binds to receptor tyrosine kinases located on the cell surface. This interaction activates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor, leading to a phosphorylation cascade that promotes glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, and lipid metabolism. Acetylcholine primarily acts through ligand-gated ion channels such as nicotinic receptors. When acetylcholine binds to these receptors, ion channels open, allowing the rapid influx or efflux of ions like sodium and potassium, leading to depolarization of the membrane, which is critical for nerve signal transmission and muscle contraction. Growth Hormone binds to its specific receptor on the cell membrane and activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. This involves the phosphorylation of Janus kinases (JAKs) and activation of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs), which then translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression, promoting growth and cell proliferation. Thyroxine (T4) and its active form, triiodothyronine (T3), are unique as they bind to nuclear receptors inside the cell.

      "explanation_images": [],
      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Decreased action of LPL with increased action of HSL In Diabetes Mellitus, the liver produces more triglycerides (TG) and VLDL due to decreased action of LPL (Lipoprotein Lipase), which reduces the clearance of triglycerides, and increased action of HSL (Hormone-Sensitive Lipase), which promotes the breakdown of stored fat into free fatty acids. This leads to an excess of free fatty acids in the liver, increasing triglyceride and VLDL production. Hence, the correct answer is Decreased action of LPL with increased action of HSL.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>In Diabetes Mellitus, biochemical disturbances arise due to impaired insulin action or secretion, leading to altered carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism. The two main forms, Type 1 and Type 2 , involve different mechanisms but share common biochemical abnormalities. Carbohydrate Metabolism: In diabetes, either insulin deficiency (Type 1) or insulin resistance (Type 2) impairs glucose uptake into cells. This leads to hyperglycemia as glucose remains elevated in the bloodstream. Without insulin\u2019s action on muscle and adipose tissue, glucose cannot be efficiently transported into cells for energy or storage. The liver compensates by increasing gluconeogenesis (glucose production from non-carbohydrate sources) and glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen into glucose), further exacerbating hyperglycemia. Additionally, decreased glucose uptake in the liver leads to reduced glycogen storage. Lipid Metabolism: In diabetes, impaired insulin signaling leads to increased lipolysis in adipose tissue, driven by elevated levels of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). This releases free fatty acids into the bloodstream, which are taken up by the liver and converted into triglycerides. The liver then packages these triglycerides into VLDL (very low-density lipoproteins), contributing to hypertriglyceridemia. Simultaneously, decreased activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in peripheral tissues reduces triglyceride clearance from VLDL, further increasing VLDL levels. Protein Metabolism: Insulin normally promotes protein synthesis, but in diabetes, its reduced effect leads to increased protein catabolism. This breakdown of proteins releases amino acids, which the liver can use to enhance gluconeogenesis, worsening hyperglycemia. Chronic hyperglycemia can also result in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which accumulate in tissues and disrupt normal cellular function, contributing to diabetic complications. Ketone Body Production: In conditions of insulin deficiency or resistance, the body\u2019s inability to use glucose leads to fatty acid oxidation in the liver. This results in the production of ketone bodies (acetone, acetoacetate, and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate), which serve as an alternative energy source. However, excessive ketone production leads to ketoacidosis, particularly in Type 1 Diabetes, where insulin deficiency is more pronounced. Renal Dysfunction: Chronic hyperglycemia also results in excess glucose filtering through the kidneys, leading to glucosuria. The kidneys, in turn, increase the reabsorption of sodium and water, which may cause fluid imbalances and contribute to hypertension. Over time, high blood glucose levels damage the kidney's filtration system, promoting nephropathy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B. Decreased action of LPL with Decreased action of HSL : If both LPL and HSL were decreased, triglyceride breakdown in both adipose tissue and in the blood would be impaired. This would not lead to an increase in VLDL production, as free fatty acids would not be elevated, and VLDL production would be reduced, not increased. Option: C. Increased action of LPL with increased action of HSL : Increased LPL activity would enhance triglyceride clearance from the bloodstream, which would reduce VLDL levels. So, this option would not result in the increased VLDL production seen in diabetes. Option: D. Increased action of LPL with decreased action of HSL : While increased LPL would clear triglycerides from the blood, decreased HSL would limit the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue. This would reduce the supply of free fatty acids to the liver, thereby decreasing VLDL production, contrary to what is observed in diabetes.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Feature Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) Hormone-Sensitive Lipase (HSL) Location \u25cf       Endothelial cells of capillaries (mostly in adipose tissue, muscle) \u25cf       Adipocytes (fat cells) Function \u25cf       Hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins to release free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol \u25cf       Breaks down stored triglycerides in adipocytes to release FFA and glycerol Regulation \u25cf       Stimulated by insulin in the fed state \u25cf       Stimulated by catecholamines (e.g., epinephrine) during fasting or stress Substrate \u25cf       Lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL) \u25cf       Intracellular triglycerides in adipose tissue Role in Lipid Metabolism \u25cf       Facilitates lipid uptake and storage in tissues \u25cf       Involved in fat mobilization for energy production during fasting</p>\n<p></p>",

Skin manifestations include erythema nodosum and various types of lesions. The exact etiology remains uncertain, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition triggered by environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals.

In addition to mucosal and skin involvement, Behcet's disease can affect the gastrointestinal system, causing symptoms resembling inflammatory bowel disease, particularly Crohn's disease, and may lead to vascular complications, including thrombosis and aneurysms. Neurological involvement, such as encephalitis or stroke, is seen in a subset of patients. The pathergy test, where a needle prick causes an exaggerated skin reaction, is often positive and is included in the diagnostic criteria.

It is caused by a mutation in the PIGA gene, which affects the production of certain proteins that protect red blood cells from complement-mediated destruction. As a result, red blood cells become more susceptible to damage by the body's immune system. PNH is primarily caused by a somatic mutation in the PIGA gene, which is involved in the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These anchors are essential for attaching protective proteins (such as CD55 and CD59) to the surface of red blood cells. Without these protective proteins, red blood cells become vulnerable to destruction by the complement system, leading to hemolysis. The disorder is \"paroxysmal\" because the hemolysis often occurs intermittently and is triggered by factors such as infections or stress, typically at night. The hallmark feature of PNH is hemolysis, which results in symptoms like dark urine (especially in the morning), fatigue, pallor, and jaundice. Other common complications include thrombosis, particularly in unusual sites such as the abdominal veins and cerebral veins, which can lead to life-threatening conditions like stroke or deep vein thrombosis. Bone marrow failure can also occur, leading to anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. PNH is diagnosed through a combination of clinical features and laboratory tests. The flow cytometry of blood samples is used to detect the absence of GPI-anchored proteins (CD55 and CD59 ) on red blood cells and white blood cells. This finding is highly suggestive of PNH. Additionally, urinalysis may show hemoglobinuria, especially in the morning, due to red blood cell lysis. The main treatment for PNH is the use of complement inhibitors such as eculizumab, which blocks the activation of the complement system and reduces hemolysis. In cases of severe bone marrow failure, bone marrow transplantation may be considered as a curative option.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Decrease in Glomerular coefficient The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is influenced by several factors, including the glomerular filtration coefficient (Kf), which is a measure of the permeability of the glomerular capillaries. A decrease in the glomerular coefficient (Kf) reduces the ability of the glomeruli to filter blood, leading to a decrease in GFR.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is a critical parameter that reflects the kidney's ability to filter blood and is essential for assessing renal function. GFR is the volume of plasma filtered by the glomeruli per minute and is influenced by the dynamics of filtration across the glomerular capillary wall. The key factors determining GFR include: Glomerular Hydrostatic Pressure: The blood pressure within the glomerular capillaries, which drives fluid and solutes through the filtration barrier. This pressure is primarily determined by the systemic blood pressure and the resistance of the afferent and efferent arterioles. Glomerular Oncotic Pressure : The osmotic pressure exerted by plasma proteins (mainly albumin) within the glomerular capillaries. It opposes filtration by drawing water back into the capillaries. An increase in plasma protein concentration (e.g., in dehydration) raises oncotic pressure and decreases GFR. Bowman's Capsule Hydrostatic Pressure : The pressure exerted by the fluid within the Bowman's capsule, which opposes the flow of filtrate from the capillaries into the capsule. A rise in this pressure (e.g., due to obstruction in the urinary tract) reduces GFR. Glomerular Filtration Coefficient (Kf) : A measure of the permeability of the glomerular capillary membrane to water and solutes. It depends on the surface area and permeability of the glomerular capillaries. Any condition that affects the structural integrity of the glomerular capillaries, such as glomerulonephritis or diabetic nephropathy, can reduce Kf and decrease GFR. The regulation of GFR is a dynamic process that involves autoregulation, ensuring that GFR remains stable despite fluctuations in systemic blood pressure. This is primarily achieved through the myogenic mechanism (where vascular smooth muscle contracts or relaxes in response to changes in blood pressure) and the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism (where the macula densa cells in the distal convoluted tubule sense sodium concentration and adjust afferent arteriole tone). Additionally, neurohormonal regulation plays a significant role in modulating GFR. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) can constrict the efferent arteriole, increasing glomerular pressure and maintaining filtration in situations like low blood volume. Sympathetic nervous system activation can also constrict afferent arterioles during stress, reducing GFR to preserve blood pressure and blood flow to vital organs.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. A decrease in glomerular oncotic pressure (which is primarily determined by plasma protein concentration) would increase GFR, as it reduces the opposing force for filtration, making it easier for fluid to be filtered into the Bowman's space. Option: C. An increase in glomerular hydrostatic pressure typically increases GFR by driving more fluid through the filtration barrier. Option: D. A decrease in Bowman's hydrostatic pressure would increase GFR, as this pressure opposes filtration. Lowering this opposing pressure allows more fluid to be filtered from the glomerulus into the Bowman's capsule.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) is a mechanism where the macula densa cells in the distal convoluted tubule sense NaCl levels. If NaCl is high, they signal the afferent arteriole to constrict, reducing GFR. If NaCl is low, they signal the arteriole to dilate, increasing GFR. This helps maintain stable filtration rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Factors affecting GFR:- Glomerular cap pressure Peritubular cap pressure Nephron plasma flow GFR FF Constrict efferent \u2191 \u2193 \u2193 \u2191 \u2191 Dilate efferent \u2193 \u2191 \u2191 \u2193 \u2193 Constrict afferent \u2193 \u2193 \u2193 \u2193 \u2194 Dilate afferent \u2191 \u2191 \u2191 \u2191 \u2194</p>\n<p></p>",

This is typically not accompanied by dysuria, as painful urination is more common in lower urinary tract conditions like urinary tract infections or bladder stones, rather than in glomerular-related issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Glomerular hematuria refers to the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) in the urine due to damage or dysfunction of the glomeruli, the tiny filtering units in the kidneys. This can occur in various glomerular diseases, including glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and lupus nephritis. Features of Glomerular Hematuria: Brown-colored or tea-colored urine: The urine may appear dark brown or cola-colored due to the presence of disintegrated RBCs or hemoglobin. No dysuria: Painful urination (dysuria) is typically not associated with glomerular hematuria because it originates from the glomeruli, not the lower urinary tract. RBC casts: These are often seen in the urine and are a hallmark of glomerular damage. They form when RBCs pass through the damaged glomeruli and get trapped in the renal tubules. No crystals : Unlike in conditions such as kidney stones, crystals are not typically present in glomerular hematuria. Edema : While edema can occur in severe cases of glomerular disease (e.g., nephrotic syndrome), it is not always present, particularly in isolated hematuria. Common Causes: Acute glomerulonephritis (post-streptococcal, IgA nephropathy) Chronic glomerulonephritis Lupus nephritis Alport syndrome Goodpasture syndrome Diagnosis: Urinalysis shows RBCs and possibly RBC casts. Kidney biopsy may be required for definitive diagnosis and to identify the underlying cause of glomerular injury.

Their presence would suggest a different cause of hematuria, not glomerular origin. Option: D. In glomerular diseases, edema can be present due to fluid retention from kidney dysfunction, especially if the glomerular damage is significant (e.g., in nephrotic syndrome).

These tumors produce excessive amounts of catecholamines \u2014 primarily norepinephrine , and to a lesser extent epinephrine and dopamine\u2014which lead to episodic or sustained hypertension. Symptoms include paroxysms of high blood pressure, palpitations, headaches, excessive sweating, tremors, and a sense of impending doom. The tumor is often associated with other endocrine disorders in the context of genetic syndromes, such as Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, and Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Diagnosis begins with biochemical tests, particularly a 24-hour urine collection for metanephrines (the breakdown products of catecholamines) or plasma free metanephrines, both of which are highly sensitive for detecting pheochromocytoma. CT or MRI of the abdomen is the imaging modality of choice to localize the tumor, with MIBG (Metaiodobenzylguanidine) scans used if the tumor is not visible or if metastasis is suspected. Once diagnosed, the definitive treatment is surgical resection of the tumor, typically an adrenalectomy. Preoperative management is crucial and involves the use of alpha-blockers (e.g., phenoxybenzamine) to control blood pressure, followed by beta-blockers to manage tachycardia. It is critical to control blood pressure and heart rate to avoid hypertensive crises during surgery. After surgery, patients require monitoring for complications like hypotension, as the sudden removal of catecholamine production can cause a drop in blood pressure. Long-term follow-up is necessary, especially for those with hereditary forms of pheochromocytoma, as they are at risk for recurrence or metastasis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
