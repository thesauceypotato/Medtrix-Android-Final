      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Low hematocrit The patient presented with hemorrhagic shock, loss of blood causes blood pressure to fall and Heart rate to increase.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The baroreceptor reflex response to the fall in blood pressure causes a reflex increase in sympathetic outflow, causing an alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated increase in arteriolar resistance, which further decreases capillary perfusion pressure. Because whole blood is lost, the concentration of circulating proteins remains normal and, therefore, the oncotic pressure remains the same. The decreased capillary pressure and normal oncotic pressure result in the transfer of fluid from the interstitium to the vascular bed, decreasing the hematocrit .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Other Option:- Option: A. Metabolic alkalosis: Trauma patients are more prone to acidosis. Option: B . Dry skin: Sympathetic stimulation causes peripheral constriction and produces sweating, resulting in the classic sign of hemorrhage: cold, damp skin. Option: C. Polyuria: Hypovolemia patients will have decreased urine output.</p>\n<p></p>",

Because the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon monoxide is affected by their chemical reactions with hemoglobin, as well as their transfer through the membrane, the diffusing capacity of the lung is determined both by the diffusing capacity of the membrane itself, as well as by the reaction with hemoglobin. The diffusing capacity of the membrane can be calculated by rearranging Fick's law for diffusion and is related to the ratio of the surface area available for diffusion and the thickness of the alveolar-capillary interface.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Other Options:- Option: B. Fibrotic lung disease and Option D. Congestive heart failure : The   of the diffusional barrier is increased by interstitial fibrosis and by interstitial or alveolar edema found in congestive heart failure. Option: C. Pulmonary embolism: The area available for diffusion is decreased by alveolar-septal departitioning in emphysema and by obstruction of the pulmonary vascular bed by pulmonary emboli.</p>\n<p></p>",
