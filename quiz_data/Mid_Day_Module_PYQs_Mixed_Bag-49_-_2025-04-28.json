Given his age (65 years) and symptoms, a CURB-65 score calculation is necessary. The CURB-65 score assigns points based on confusion, urea level, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age \u2265 65. Here, the patient scores at least 3 points (confusion, tachypnea, age \u2265 65), indicating a need for hospital admission and potentially ICU care.</li><li>\u2022 In managing CAP with a high CURB-65 score, empirical antibiotic therapy typically includes a combination of a beta-lactam (like ceftriaxone) and a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (like levofloxacin).

Admit and give IV levofloxacin:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Treat at home with oral Amox-clav: Given the patient's high CURB-65 score, home treatment is inappropriate.
