      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>DEXA scan Sudden loss of consciousness not associated with seizure, rapid onset. Spontaneous and complete recovery point towards the diagnosis of Syncope. DEXA scan is used as a test for Osteoporosis and is not needed in patients with Syncope.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Syncope: Syncope is a transient, self-limited, loss of consciousness due to acute global impairment of cerebral blood flow . The onset is rapid, duration brief , and recovery spontaneous and complete . Typical presyncopal symptoms include dizziness, lightheadedness or faintness, weakness, fatigue, and visual and auditory disturbances. The causes of syncope can be divided into three general categories: (1) Neurally mediated syncope (also called reflex or vasovagal syncope ) (2) Orthostatic hypotension (3) Cardiac syncope.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option A. Echocardiography- should be performed in Syncope patients with a history of cardiac disease or if abnormalities are found on physical examination or the ECG. The echocardiographic diagnosis that may be responsible for syncope includes aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac tumours, aortic dissection, and pericardial tamponade. Echocardiography also has a role in risk stratification based on the left ventricular ejection fraction. Option B. Tilt table test- a tilt-table test with beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement). The hemodynamic abnormalities demonstrated on the tilt-table test may be useful in distinguishing orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic failure from the hypotensive bradycardic response of neurally mediated syncope. Similarly, the tilt-table test may help identify patients with syncope due to immediate or delayed orthostatic hypotension. Option: C. Carotid sinus massage- should be considered in patients with symptoms suggestive of carotid sinus syncope and patients >40 years with recurrent syncope of unknown etiology . This test should only be carried out under continuous ECG and blood pressure monitoring and should be avoided in patients with carotid bruits, possible or known plaques, or stenosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Dizziness- an imprecise symptom used to describe a variety of common sensations that include vertigo, light-headedness, faintness, and imbalance. Vertigo -a sense of spinning or other motion that may be physiological, occurring during or after a sustained head rotation, or pathological, due to vestibular dysfunction. Light-headedness-presyncope sensations resulting from brain hypoperfusion but as used by patients have little specificity, as they may also refer to other symptoms such as disequilibrium and Imbalance.</p>\n<p></p>",

Two forms of nystagmus that are characteristic of lesions of the cerebellar pathways are vertical nystagmus with downward fast phases ( downbeat nystagmus ) and horizontal nystagmus that changes direction with gaze ( gaze-evoked nystagmus). Option: D. Use of Frenzel eyeglasses (self-illuminated goggles with convex lenses that blur the patient\u2019s vision but allow the examiner to see the eyes greatly magnified) can aid in the detection of peripheral vestibular nystagmus because they reduce the patient\u2019s ability to use visual fixation to suppress nystagmus.</p>\n<p></p>",

Nystagmus from an acute peripheral lesion is unidirectional, with fast phases beating away from the ear with the lesion. Nystagmus that changes direction with gaze is due to a central lesion. Option: B.Absence of a head impulse sign in a patient with acute\u2002prolonged vertigo should suggest a central cause. Option: D. Unilateral hearing loss suggests peripheral vertigo . Findings\u2002such\u2002as diplopia, dysarthria, and limb ataxia suggest a central disorder.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Head impulse test- The most useful bedside test of peripheral vestibular function is the head impulse test , in which the Vestibulo ocular reflex (VOR) is assessed with small amplitude (~20 degrees) rapid head rotations. While the patient fixates on a target, the head is rotated to the left or right . If the Vestibulo ocular reflex is deficient, the rotation is followed by a catch-up saccade in the opposite direction (e.g., a leftward saccade after a rightward rotation ). The head impulse test can identify both unilateral (catch-up saccades after rotations toward the weak side) and bilateral vestibular hypofunction (catch-up saccades after rotations In both directions).</p>\n<p></p>",
