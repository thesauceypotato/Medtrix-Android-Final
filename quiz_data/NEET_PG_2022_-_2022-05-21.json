Subthalamic nuclei</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 Most probable diagnosis as per the clinical history is hemiballismus which is caused by a lesion in subthalamic nuclei.</li><li>\u2022 Hemiballismus is a disorder characterized by violent involuntary abnormal movements on one side of the body involving mostly the arm. While walking, the arm swings widely. These movements are called the flinging movements. These movements are due to the release phenomenon because of the absence of inhibitory influence on movements. Hemiballismus occurs due to degeneration of subthalamic nucleus of Luys.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Globus pallidus : Incorrect for hemiballismus. Lesions here typically result in different forms of dyskinesia, such as parkinsonism or dystonia, but not hemiballismus.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Globus pallidus</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Putamen : Also incorrect for this symptom. While putamen lesions are involved in many movement disorders, like Huntington's disease and some forms of Parkinson's disease, they do not typically cause hemiballismus.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Putamen</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Caudate nucleus : Incorrect. Lesions in the caudate nucleus are more often associated with Huntington's disease, which leads to chorea\u2014rapid, jerky movements\u2014not the large-amplitude flinging movements seen in hemiballismus.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Caudate nucleus</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 For a patient presenting with unilateral flinging, violent limb movements following a stroke, the subthalamic nuclei should be considered as the primary site of lesion. This knowledge is crucial for accurate diagnosis and guiding treatment decisions, such as the use of neuroleptics or other interventions to control these disruptive movements.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. B. Segment II is due to Laplace Law</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The true statement regarding the given cystometrogram is that segment lb is due to Laplace law.</li><li>\u2022 The law of Laplace correlates volume and wall tension, is applicable to urine storage.</li><li>\u2022 According to Law of Laplace, the pressure (P) in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension (T) divided by the radius (R). This is expressed as P= 2T/R.</li><li>\u2022 As the bladder gets filled, the radius increases along with the tension, hence there is a slight increase in pressure until the bladder is relatively full, which explains the flatness of the graph in segment II</li><li>\u2022 The first urge to void is felt at a bladder volume of about 150 mL. A marked sense of fullness is felt at a bladder volume of 400ml.</li><li>\u2022 Cystometrogram is a plot of intravesical pressure against the volume of fluid in the bladder. The curve shows three segments:</li><li>\u2022 Initial Filling Phase (or Low-Pressure Phase ): This phase represents the storage phase of bladder function. Rapid Filling Phase (or High-Pressure Phase): In this phase, the intravesical pressure increases more rapidly as the bladder volume reaches a certain threshold. The detrusor muscle, which contracts to initiate bladder emptying, starts to generate increased pressure as the bladder approaches its capacity. This phase represents the transition from storage to voiding phase. Voiding Phase (or Micturition Phase): In the voiding phase, the intravesical pressure rises to its highest level as the detrusor muscle contracts forcefully to empty the bladder. The pressure exceeds the urethral resistance, resulting in urine expulsion. This phase is associated with the sensation of needing to urinate and the act of micturition (urination).</li><li>\u2022 Initial Filling Phase (or Low-Pressure Phase ): This phase represents the storage phase of bladder function.</li><li>\u2022 Initial Filling Phase (or Low-Pressure Phase</li><li>\u2022 Rapid Filling Phase (or High-Pressure Phase): In this phase, the intravesical pressure increases more rapidly as the bladder volume reaches a certain threshold.

Segment Ia is due to residual urine : Incorrect. Segment I, particularly the initial part of the curve, typically represents the early filling phase of the bladder, not necessarily residual urine.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Segment Ia is due to residual urine</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Micturition fails to happen in segment II : Incorrect. Segment II represents the continuation of the filling phase; micturition (urination) does not occur here because it typically begins when the bladder reaches its threshold capacity and the detrusor muscle contracts, which would be represented later in the graph.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Micturition fails to happen in segment II</li><li>\u2022 Option D. The dotted line represents that micturition has occurred : Incorrect. The dotted line likely indicates phase transitions within the bladder's filling and voiding cycle, not necessarily the occurrence of micturition.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Small fistulas can heal spontaneously; however, most established fistulas require surgical repair. The surgical repair is usually performed vaginally after approximately 3 months to allow inflammation to subside. Post-operatively, continuous bladder drainage for 14 days along with antibiotics is recommended to facilitate healing. Following VVF repair, it is recommended that the patient abstain from sexual activity for 3 months to allow the surgical site to heal properly and avoid complications. Additionally, pregnancy should be avoided for a year to ensure the integrity and strength of the repair before subjecting the area to the stresses of pregnancy and childbirth.</li><li>\u2022 Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) is a type of urinary fistula that commonly arises due to obstetric trauma.</li><li>\u2022 Small fistulas can heal spontaneously; however, most established fistulas require surgical repair.</li><li>\u2022 The surgical repair is usually performed vaginally after approximately 3 months to allow inflammation to subside.</li><li>\u2022 Post-operatively, continuous bladder drainage for 14 days along with antibiotics is recommended to facilitate healing.</li><li>\u2022 Following VVF repair, it is recommended that the patient abstain from sexual activity for 3 months to allow the surgical site to heal properly and avoid complications.</li><li>\u2022 Additionally, pregnancy should be avoided for a year to ensure the integrity and strength of the repair before subjecting the area to the stresses of pregnancy and childbirth.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

The spiral artery supplies blood to the endometrium. In normal pregnancy, there is an invasion of the extravillous trophoblasts (specifically, endovascular trophoblasts) into the walls of the spiral arteries. This process takes place in two waves: First wave (10-12 weeks): Endovascular trophoblasts invade up to the decidual segments. Second wave (16-18 weeks): Endovascular trophoblasts invade up to the myometrial segments. This invasion results in the distension of the spiral arterioles, transforming them into a low-resistance, low-pressure, and high-flow system. In preeclampsia, the failure of the second wave of endovascular trophoblastic invasion into uterine vessels leads to decreased placental perfusion.</li><li>\u2022 Preeclampsia occurs due to the failure of the invasion of extravillous trophoblasts into the spiral artery.</li><li>\u2022 The spiral artery supplies blood to the endometrium.
