It is effective for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, which is hormone-dependent. Tamoxifen works by blocking the effects of estrogen in the breast tissue, thereby preventing cancer cells from growing and spreading.</li><li>\u2022 Mechanism of Action : Tamoxifen competes with estrogen for binding to estrogen receptors in breast tissue. By blocking estrogen's effects, it inhibits the growth and proliferation of estrogen-dependent cancer cells. Administration : Tamoxifen is taken orally, usually once a day for five years. Side Effects : Common side effects include hot flashes, mood changes, vaginal dryness, and an increased risk of blood clots (DVT).</li><li>\u2022 Mechanism of Action : Tamoxifen competes with estrogen for binding to estrogen receptors in breast tissue.

If the encephalopathy develops rapidly after the onset of jaundice (i.e., within 7 days), it suggests a more acute and potentially reversible cause, such as acute viral hepatitis, which might recover without transplantation.</li><li>\u2022 Given the information, the incorrect parameter in the King's College criteria for transplantation, would be \"Jaundice less than 7 days before development of encephalopathy\" (Option D).</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

PT >100s: Prothrombin time (PT) reflects the liver's ability to synthesize clotting factors.

Bilirubin >300 mmol/L : An elevated bilirubin level indicates significant liver dysfunction.

Arterial ulcer - Arterial (ischemic) ulcers occur at distal locations like toes and dorsum of foot.
