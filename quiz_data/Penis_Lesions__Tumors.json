      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Bowenoid papulosis Bowenoid papulosis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) that presents as red-brown papules in the genital area and does not progress to carcinoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Bowenoid papulosis Seen predominantly in young, sexually active males. Solitary or multiple, rapidly growing, red-brown to violaceous, flat-topped papules that may coalesce into larger plaques on the penile shaft or the perineum. The papules are nonpruritic , range in size from 2- 10 mm, and usually lack scale Histopathology: Bowenoid papulosis shows the typical features of Bowen's disease. Full-thickness epidermal atypia with crowding and an irregular, \" windblown\" arrangement of the nuclei, many of which are large, hyperchromatic, and pleomorphic Dyskeratotic and multinucleated keratinocytes are also present, as are atypical mitoses. The basement membrane is intact.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Bowen's disease: It is a type of squamous cell carcinoma in situ, which means it has not yet invaded the underlying tissue. Without treatment, Bowen's disease can progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Option: C. Leukoplakia: It is a condition characterized by white patches on the mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, or gums. While leukoplakia itself is not cancerous, it can be a precancerous lesion that has the potential to progress to squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated. Option: D. Erythroplakia: It is a red patch that can occur on the mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, or gums. Like leukoplakia, erythroplakia is a precancerous lesion that can progress to squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Pre-malignant lesions of Invasive Penile SCC: Erythroplasia of Queyrat Condyloma accuminata Bowen\u2019s disease</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Bowen\u2019s disease Vs Bowenoid papulosis Features Bowen\u2019s disease (carcinoma in\n  situ) Bowenoid papulosis Age >30 years <30 years Lesion Solitary, Gray-white Multiple, reddish brown Progression Increase risk of invasive\n  Squamous cell carcinoma Does not progress to invasive\n  Squamous cell carcinoma Visceral malignancies Increased risk of visceral\n  malignancies No Histology Carcinoma in situ (HPV-16) Same as Bowen\u2019s (HPV-16)</p>\n<p></p>",
