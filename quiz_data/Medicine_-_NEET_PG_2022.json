      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Sickle Cell Anemia If results of electrophoresis shows \u201cS\u201d spike with HbF concentration of less than 30%, the diagnosis is sickle cell anemia. Pain in extremities suggests hand foot syndrome. The hemoglobin electrophoresis with beta thalassemia trait usually has reduced or absent HbA, elevated levels of HbA2, and increased HbF. If HbS and HbC are present in roughly equal amounts, the diagnosis is HbSC disease. Acute painful episodes are the most common critical events in sickle cell disease. It is characterised by unprovoked severe pain in the extremities or torso that is often symmetrical and stereotypical and usually requires treatment with potent opioids. Provocative factors include infection, fever, excessive exercise, anxiety, abrupt changes in temperature, hypoxia, or hypertonic dyes. All patients will experience it at some point. It is the most common reason for hospitalization. Vaso-occlusive episode -defined as new onset pain lasting for> 4 hours with no alternative explanation, requiring analgesics. Sudden deaths-due from Arrhythmias or pulmonary embolism Predictors of severe crisis or multi-organ failure- drastic drop in hemoglobin, a drastic drop in platelet counts, and extreme leukocytosis. Pathophysiology- In SCA, the intracellular concentration of HbS is almost 100% . The fundamental event in pathophysiology is the polymerisation of HbS. The damaged RBCs are less flexible and highly adhesive. Repeated cycles of sickling and unsickling- SHORTEN the RBCs lifespan\u2014>Occlusion of blood vessels in every body organ\u2014--> trigger inflammatory cascade\u2014- ->vascular endothelial dysfunction and chronic organ damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A - THALASSEMIA: Alpha thalassemia is caused by alpha-globin gene deletion which results in reduced or absent production of alpha-globin chains. Alpha globin gene has 4 alleles and disease severity ranges from mild to severe depending on the number of deletions of the alleles. Four allele deletion is the most severe form in which no alpha globins are produced and the excess gamma chains (present during the fetal period) form tetramers. It is incompatible with life and results in hydrops fetalis. Beta thalassemia results from point mutations in the beta-globin gene. It is divided into three categories based on the zygosity of the beta-gene mutation. A heterozygous mutation (beta-plus thalassemia) results in beta-thalassemia minor in which beta chains are underproduced. It is mild and usually asymptomatic. Beta thalassemia major is caused by a homozygous mutation (beta-zero thalassemia) of the beta-globin gene, resulting in the total absence of beta chains. It manifests clinically as jaundice, growth retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, endocrine abnormalities, and severe anemia requiring life-long blood transfusions. Option C - Anemia of inflammation, also called anemia of chronic disease or ACD, is a type of anemia that affects people who have conditions that cause inflammation, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, cancer link, and chronic kidney disease Option D - Unlike sickle cell trait in which major Hb is HbA, in the coexistence state the major Hb is HbS which constitutes more than 60% of Hb depending on the nature of the disease (beta-zero or beta-plus0.)</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Anemia in a patient of sickle cell disease can be due to aplastic crisis, hemolysis, sequestration, or Epo deficiency(CKD -renal complication) Aplastic crisis: Typically seen in infections with human parvovirus B19, pneumococcus, EBV.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Desferrioxamine Iron toxicity is one of the leading causes of deaths by poisoning in children < 6 years. Pathophysiology Absorption of excessive quantities of ingested iron can lead to: Cellular toxicity: Impaired oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction \u2192 cellular death The liver is the most affected organ. In chronic overload, iron deposits into myocardial cells \u2192 myocardial siderosis and death Corrosive toxicity : Iron is corrosive to GI mucosa. Leads to GI symptoms and potential blood loss</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option A: Dimercaprol, also known as British anti-Lewisite (BAL), is mostly used as antidote for poisoning of heavy metals such as lead and arsenic. Arsenic and some other heavy metals act by chelating with adjacent thiol residues on metabolic enzymes, creating a chelate complex that inhibits the affected enzyme's activity. Dimercaprol competes with the thiol groups for binding the metal ion, which is then excreted in the urine. Option C: As a degradation product of penicillin antibiotics, penicillamine chelates with heavy metals and increases their urinary excretion. Oral chelation therapy with d-penicillamine (d-PCN) has been proven to be effective in the treatment of mild-to-moderate lead poisoning. Penicillamine is chelating agent used to decrease copper stores in Wilson disease, which also has immunomodulatory activity in rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma and systemic lupus erythematosus. Option D: - Activated Charcoal - Activated charcoal, also known as activated carbon, is a medication used to treat poisonings that occurred by mouth. To be effective it must be used within a short time of the poisoning occurring, typically an hour. It does not work for poisonings by cyanide, corrosive agents, iron, lithium, alcohols, or malathion.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Gluten Restricted Diet This is a classic case scenario of Gluten -sensitive enteropathy or, as it is more commonly called, celiac disease. It commonly manifests as \u201csilent\u201d celiac disease (i.e., minimal or no symptoms) and is precipitated by the ingestion of gluten, a component of wheat protein, in genetically susceptible persons. Serologic tests for antibodies against endomysium, transglutaminase, and gliadin identify most patients with the disease. Fewer than 10 percent of adults with gluten-sensitive enteropathy present with dermatitis herpetiformis. The rash of dermatitis herpetiformis is intensely pruritic and typically occurs on the back, buttocks, knees, and elbows. Unexcoriated lesions are remarkably like those of herpes simplex (thus, the term \u201cherpetiformis\u201d).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. - High Fibre Diet - A high fiber diet changes the bacterial makeup of the colon toward a more favorable balance. For instance, it is known that those people with obesity, diabetes type 2 and inflammatory bowel disease have a predominance of bad bacteria in the colon. Option: C. - A low-carb diet limits carbohydrates \u2014 such as those found in grains, starchy vegetables and fruit \u2014 and emphasizes foods high in protein and fat. Many types of low-carb diets exist. Each diet has varying restrictions on the types and amounts of carbohydrates you can eat. Option: D. - Fat Restricted Diet - A fat-restricted diet often limits fat to 50 grams per day. Fat has nine calories per gram. So, if a person needs 2,000 calories each day, this means about 22% of those calories can be from fat. The rest should be from carbs and proteins. Granular IgA deposition on immunofluorescence of a skin biopsy specimen is diagnostic. The primary treatment for celiac disease is the removal of gluten and related proteins from the diet. Complete exclusion of dietary gluten generally results in rapid and complete healing of small-bowel inflammation.</p>\n<p></p>",
