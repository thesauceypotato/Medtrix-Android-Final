Some of these wounds may be mistaken for traumatic wounds, e.g. a surgical chest stab wound for putting a drainage tube. Sometimes, a traumatic wound may be enlarged and included in the surgical procedure, or a drainage tube may be put in a homicidal stab wound.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For incorrect Options:- Options A, C & D: Wounds intentionally created by a doctor are therapeutic wounds and never traumatic, unintentional or unexpected. Hence these three options are not the correct answers.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Gaping in stab wounds Cleavage lines of Langer: Stab and incised wounds are slit-shaped with two acute angles or gape open depending on their location and orientation, about the so-called cleavage lines of Langer. The pattern of fibre arrangement of the dense feltwork of intimately intermingled dermal collagen and elastic fibres is called the cleavage direction or lines of cleavage of the skin. Their linear representation on the skin is called. Langer's lines are almost the same in all persons. Cleavage lines in the dermal layers of skin are primarily arranged in parallel rows. The extremities tend to run longitudinally, in the neck and trunk circumferentially. A stab wound which runs parallel to the cleavage lines will remain slit-shaped and narrow, and the dimensions of the blade will be represented with considerable accuracy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Options A, C & D: The above image shows Lines of Langer, unrelated to death due to hanging, postmortem changes or internal organ injuries. Hence these three options are not the correct answers.</p>\n<p></p>",

Heat Ruptures: In severe burning or charring skin contracts, heat ruptures occur before or after death.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option B: These ruptures or splits in the skin may be several centimetres long; superficially, they may resemble lacerations or even incised wounds. Option D: They are produced by splitting the soft part. These splits may be anywhere but are usually seen over fleshy body areas, like calves, thighs and extensor surfaces, joints and on the head. Splits of abdominal walls occur parallel to muscle fibres. They can be differentiated by: The bleeding in the wound and surrounding tissues is absent since heat coagulates the blood in the vessels. Option A: Irregular margins. Absence of bruising or other signs of a strong reaction in the margins. The underlying muscle usually ruptures due to heat when the skin is completely burnt.</p>\n<p></p>",
