It is one of the most prominent arteries located in the temporal region of the head. In the given MR angiogram, the marked vessel corresponds to a superficial, external branch that is located in the temporal region, supporting the identification as the superficial temporal artery .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Branches of external carotid artery: MNEMONIC - \u2018 SALFOPMS\u2019 S: superior thyroid artery A: ascending pharyngeal artery L: lingual artery F: facial artery O: occipital artery P: posterior auricular artery M: maxillary artery S: superficial temporal artery</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Basilar Artery is a midline vessel located in the posterior intracranial region. It is formed by the union of the vertebral arteries and supplies blood to the posterior part of the brain, including the brainstem and cerebellum. Option: C. Middle Meningeal Artery The middle meningeal artery is a branch of the maxillary artery (from the external carotid system). It supplies the dura mater and is located deeper within the cranial vault, primarily visualized in the middle cranial fossa. Option: D. Occipital Artery The occipital artery is another branch of the external carotid artery. It runs posteriorly toward the occiput to supply the scalp in the back of the head.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Eosinophilic granuloma The radiograph shows multiple lytic lesions in the pelvis The lytic appearance is sharp and well-defined, typical of a benign or less aggressive lesion The patient\u2019s inability to bear weight after a trivial trauma indicates the presence of a pathological fracture . Eosinophilic granuloma often weakens the cortical bone, predisposing it to fracture. In eosinophilic granuloma, periosteal reaction is typically absent or minimal, differentiating it from more aggressive pathologies</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Eosinophilic granuloma aka Langerhans cell histiocytosis can affect any bone in the body but has a predilection for: Skull Mandible Long bones (e.g., femur, humerus) Vertebrae (thoracic spine is most commonly affected) Radiographic findings- Lytic Lesions: Well-demarcated osteolytic lesion with sharp borders. Often described as \"punched-out lesions,\" especially in the skull. Can have a beveled edge in the skull due to asymmetrical erosion of the inner and outer tables. Cortical Thinning/Destruction : No Periosteal Reaction : Minimal or absent periosteal reaction differentiates EG from more aggressive lesions like osteosarcoma. In Long Bones (Femur, Humerus): Diaphyseal or Meta diaphyseal Location: Most lesions are found in the midshaft or metaphysis. Endosteal Scalloping : The lesion can erode the inner surface of the cortex. Pathological Fractures : Common, as lesions weaken the bone significantly. Vertebra Plana: A classic feature where the vertebral body collapses completely, appearing flattened on lateral X-rays. The intervertebral disc spaces remain preserved. In the Skull: Geographic Skull Lesions: Well-defined, round, punched-out lesions without sclerotic margins. Multiple lesions can coexist, giving a \"geographic map\" appearance.\\ Well defined lytic bony lesions with beveled edges. Pulmonary involvement in LCH- HRCT is the gold standard for identifying pulmonary involvement in LCH. Small, irregularly shaped centrilobular nodules are more commonly seen along with cystic lesions. These nodules correspond to Langerhans cell granulomas.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Disseminated Tuberculosis: Tuberculosis typically involves the spine (Pott\u2019s disease) or large joints. Isolated long bone involvement is rare, and systemic signs like fever and night sweats are not present Option: C. Brown Tumor: Brown tumors result from severe hyperparathyroidism (often secondary to chronic kidney disease). There can be features of hypercalcemia or other skeletal findings (e.g., \"salt-and-pepper\" skull, subperiosteal bone resorption) makes this diagnosis unlikely. Option: D. Metastasis: Metastasis is a strong consideration in this age group, it typically presents with multiple lesions or systemic evidence of malignancy. The imaging findings here are more consistent with a benign lesion, as metastatic lesions often appear more aggressive.</p>\n<p></p>",
