OPTION C- Horse face deformity is not seen anywhere. OPTION D- Frog face deformity is seen in juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Adenoid facies. Chronic nasal obstruction and mouth breathing lead to characteristic facial appearance called adenoid facies. The child has an elongated face with dull expression, open mouth, prominent and crowded upper teeth and hitched up upper lip. Nose gives a pinched-in appearance due to disuse atrophy of alaenasi . Hard palate in these cases is highly arched as the moulding action of the tongue on palate is lost</p>\n<p></p>",
