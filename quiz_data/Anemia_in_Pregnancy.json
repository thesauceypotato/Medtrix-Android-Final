Preeclampsia may be related to hypoproteinemia and malnutrition, which leads to anemia . Statement 2. Intercurrent infection \u2014Not only does anemia diminish disease resistance , but any pre-existing lesion, if present, will flare up . It should be noted that the condition itself impairs erythropoiesis by bone marrow depression. Statement 3.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>None of the above</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Because of chronic debility, complications caused by pregnancy, and the predictably shortened life span of women with sickle-cell anemia, contraception and possibly sterilization are essential considerations. Many clinicians do not recommend combined hormonal pills because of potential adverse vascular and thrombotic effects after a systematic review. However, it was concluded that there was no increase in complications with their use in women with sickle cell syndromes . Option: B. The CDC (2013b) regards the contraceptive pill, patch, and ring, along with the copper intrauterine device (IUD), as having \u201c advantages that generally outweigh theoretical or proven risks . Option: C. Progesterone-only methods may be used without restrictions because progesterone has long been known to prevent painful sickle-cell crises . Low-dose oral progestins or progesterone injections, or implants seem ideal .</p>\n<p></p>",
