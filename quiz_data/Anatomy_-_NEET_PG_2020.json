      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pretracheal Fascia Pretracheal fascia prevents upward extension of thyroid swelling. Pretracheal fascia: It encloses and suspends the thyroid gland and forms its false capsule. Attachments Superiorly : Hyoid bone in the median plane oblique line of thyroid cartilage (laterally), Cricoid cartilage, (more laterally). Inferiorly : Below the thyroid gland it encloses the inferior thyroid veins, passes behind the brachiocephalic veins, and finally blends with the arch of the aorta. On either side : It fuses with the front of the carotid sheath deep to the sternocleidomastoid. The posterior layer of the thyroid capsule is thick and forms a ligament of Berry. Capsule of Thyroid gland</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The pretracheal fascia is a layer of the deep cervical fascia at the front of the neck. It attaches to the hyoid bone above, and - extending down into the thorax - blends with the fibrous pericardium below. It encloses the thyroid gland and parathyroid glands, trachea, and esophagus. It extends medially in front of the carotid vessels. It assists in forming the carotid sheath. The back portion of the pretracheal fascia is known as the buccopharyngeal fascia.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B-Investing Fascia The investing layer of deep cervical fascia is the most superficial part of the deep cervical fascia, and encloses the whole neck. Option C- Thyrohyoid membrane The thyrohyoid membrane (or hyothyroid membrane ) is a broad, fibro-elastic sheet of the larynx. It connects the upper border of the thyroid cartilage to the hyoid bone. Option D- Sternothyroid muscle The sternothyroid muscle , or sternothyroideus , is an infrahyoid muscle in the neck. It acts to depress the hyoid bone. It is below the sternohyoid muscle. It is shorter and wider than the sternohyoid.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The pretracheal fascia is continued behind the depressor muscles of the hyoid bone. After enveloping the thyroid gland, it is prolonged in front of the trachea to meet the corresponding layer of the opposite side. The pretracheal layer of the deep cervical fascia passes in front of the carotid sheath (i.e., common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and vagus nerve) and in front of the cervical viscera (larynx, oesophagus, and pharynx). The muscular layer ensheaths the infrahyoid muscles.</p>\n<p></p>",
