Cardiac catheterization shows elevated right atrial pressure with the loss of the descent Both result in distended neck veins or a high central venous pressure (CVP). Both may not improve after fluid resuscitation as both of them are classified under obstructive shock. Pericardial tamponade involves the following : Pulsus paradoxus : Exaggerated decrease in arterial pressure during inspiration (>10 mm Hg drop) Electrical alternans : This is alterations of the axis of the QRS complex on ECG, manifested as the height of the QRS complex. Distant (muffled) heart sounds. CXR : Clear chest with normal air entry. Enlargement of cardiac silhouette when >250 mL has accumulated. Tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension with the onset of cardiogenic shock.m Breath sound present in pericardial tamponade. Tension pneumothorax i nvolves the following: Look for respiratory distress CXR: Shift of trachea away from side of pneumothorax Breath sounds absent Hyperresonance to percussion on the side of pneumothorax</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Tension pneumothorax occurs when communication between injured lung and parietal pleura becomes a one-way valve without any outflow from the pleural space. The pressure in the pleural space increases causing hypoxia, mediastinal shift, and can compromise venous return as well. Clinical presentation of a pneumothorax can range anywhere from a symptomatic to chest pain and shortness of breath. A tension pneumothorax can cause severe hypotension (obstructive shock) and even death. Beck's triad describes symptoms commonly associated with tension pneumothorax. The three components of Beck's triad are: Distended neck veins Muffled heart sounds Hypotension Other symptoms include tachypnea, dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia. Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis and treatment should never be delayed by waiting for radiological confirmation. Management - Immediate decompression by insertion of a large bore needle into the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line of the affected side then followed by insertion of a chest tube through the fifth intercostal space in the anterior axillary line.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Pneumothorax refers to the presence of air in the pleural space.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Start thrombolysis It is a case of ischemic stroke. Treatment of Stroke Thrombolytics : Before anticoagulating in order to rule out a hemorrhagic stroke see the head NCCT (non contrast CT). In this case, CT brain is normal suggesting there is no hemorrhage. Patient is in a window period (4.5 hours), so the next step is thrombolysis with Alteplase/Tenecteplase. Thrombolytic agent [ recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA)] use between 3 and 4.5 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms is useful in selected patients. Ideally, thrombolysis done within 3 hours produces better neurologic outcomes. <20 % of patients with a stroke come in time to get thrombolytics (<3 hours). Catheter retrieval of clot : If the patient is coming after 5 hours, his/her clot has to be removed with a catheter. This is useful up to 6\u201312 hours after stroke.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>BP Control Antihypertensive agents given if the following three conditions are present: The patient\u2019s BP is very high\u2014SBP > 220, DBP > 120, or mean arterial pressure > 130 mmHg). The patient has a significant medical indication for antihypertensive therapy. Examples include the following: Aortic dissection Hypertensive encephalopathy Acute MI Severe heart failure IV Nicardipine/Clevidipine or Labetalol is the first-line agent to control blood pressure. Surgery Surgical management: Decompression to prevent herniation if cerebellar hematoma or superficial hemorrhage of cerebral white matter is there. Carotid artery stenosis is managed by endarterectomy .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Contraindications to thrombolytic therapy : Presence of bleeding disorder Stroke within 1-year of cerebral trauma or brain surgery within 6 months Presence of intracranial neoplasm/mass Active bleeding or surgery within 6 weeks Previous history of hemorrhagic stroke CPR within 3 weeks that was traumatic (e.g., chest compressions) Suspicion of aortic dissection There is no standard role for double antiplatelet  therapy (Aspirin + Clopidogrel)  in ischemic stroke (except in certain extremely special scenarios). Even if aspirin is given it has to be given \u226524 hours post-thrombolysis . Only if thrombolysis or any intervention cannot be done/need not be done, Aspirin can be given as soon as possible after CT. Antiplatelet medication : Aspirin or clopidogrel or aspirin combined with dipyridamole is acceptable as an initial antiplatelet medication to prevent a subsequent stroke. Aspirin : Best initial therapy for those coming too late for thrombolytics. Aspirin is given only after 3 hours of stroke. It is best if given within 24 hours of symptom onset. Clopidogrel : If the patient has developed a stroke on aspirin, then switch to clopidogrel. Dipyridamole : If the patient is already on aspirin when a new stroke or transient ischemic attack occurs, add dipyridamole or switch to clopidogrel.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

The three principal features of tamponade (Beck's triad) are hypotension, soft or absent heart sounds, and jugular venous distention with a prominent x (early systolic) descent but an absent y (early diastolic) descent. Paradoxical Pulse: This important clue to the presence of cardiac tamponade consists of a greater than normal (10 mmHg) inspiratory decline in systolic arterial pressure. When severe, it may be detected by palpating weakness or even the disappearance of the arterial pulse during inspiration. Because both ventricles share a tight incompressible covering, i.e..., the pericardial sac and the inspiratory enlargement of the right ventricle cause leftward bulging of the interventricular septum, reducing left ventricular volume, stroke volume, and arterial systolic pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
