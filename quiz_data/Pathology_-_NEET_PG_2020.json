      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>PML-RARA All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is used in the treatment of tumors associated with B. PML-RARA. PML-RARA is a fusion gene resulting from a chromosomal translocation between the PML gene on chromosome 15 and the RARA gene on chromosome 17. This translocation is characteristic of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). ATRA is a derivative of vitamin A a nd acts as a differentiating agent in APL treatment. It binds to the abnormal PML-RARA protein, promoting the differentiation of leukemia cells into mature granulocytes, and inducing remission in APL patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. BCR-ABL: This fusion gene is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and the standard treatment for CML involves tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, not ATRA. Option C. cMYC: cMYC is a proto-oncogene that can be involved in the development of various cancers, but ATRA is not the specific treatment for cMYC-associated tumors. Option D. CEBPA: CEBPA is a transcription factor gene, and mutations in this gene are associated with a specific subtype of AML.

Folate (vitamin B9) and vitamin B12 (cobalamin) are both essential for DNA synthesis and red blood cell maturation. They play crucial roles in the formation of healthy red blood cells. Folate deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by large, immature red blood cells. When a patient with vitamin B12 deficiency (pernicious anemia) is treated with folate alone, it can improve the anemia, but it may mask the underlying vitamin B12 deficiency. Folate therapy can correct the megaloblastic anemia caused by folate deficiency but does not address the neurological symptoms associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neurological problems due to demyelination of nerves, resulting in sensory and motor disturbances. Prolonged vitamin B12 deficiency can cause irreversible nerve damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Folate not absorbed: If folate was not absorbed, the anemia would not have improved with folate therapy. Option B.

Deficiency of folate reductase in the CNS: Deficiency of folate reductase in the central nervous system would not be the cause of worsening neurological symptoms in the context of folate therapy.</p>\n<p></p>",

Interleukins are signaling proteins that play a crucial role in regulating the immune system and inflammation. IL-4 is known as an interleukin-4 and is produced by T helper 2 (Th2) cells and mast cells. It is a key cytokine involved in promoting the differentiation and activation of eosinophils. IL-4 stimulates the production and release of eosinophils from the bone marrow and enhances their survival in peripheral tissues. Additionally, IL-4 also induces the expression of cell surface receptors on eosinophils, making them more responsive to other proinflammatory signals.

Emphysema is not a characteristic feature of this condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Emphysema Vs Chronic Bronchitis Emphysema Chronic Bronchitis Aka Pink puffers Blue bloaters Presentation Shortness of breath and scanty sputum production Chronic productive cough General Appearance Thin, sometimes cachexic, with rosy skin tones Often overweight, obese Sputum Scanty , Mucoid Copious , Purulent Cor Pulomonale Rare, except in the late stages More prominent Chest X-ray findings Hyperinflated lungs , small heart. Diaphragm: low and flat Normal-sized lungs, Right ventricular hypertrophy.

Macrocytosis is frequently linked to alcoholism, with or without liver disease. In fact, it is purported to be one of the most common causes of non megaloblastic macrocytosis In cases of macrocytosis related to alcoholism the elevated MCV may be due to the direct effect of the alcohol, liver disease and/or folate deficiency.</p>\n<p></p>",

Between 20% and 60% of people with a solid organ transplant develop a symptomatic CMV infection. These symptoms are similar to the flu \u2013 fever, body aches, sore throat \u2013 and may be difficult to control. The disease caused by post-transplant CMV (PT-CMV) occurs due to:- Transmission from the transplanted organ, Due to reactivation of latent infection, or After a primary infection in seronegative transplant patients.</p>\n<p></p>",
