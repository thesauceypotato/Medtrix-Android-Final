HCG released from the placenta is the initial stimulus for testosterone production in the male fetus. Later by the eighth week of gestation, fetal pituitary LH (luteinizing hormone) stimulates the Leydig cells of the testes to produce testosterone. Sex differentiation of the embryo depends on the Y chromosome, which contains the testis-determining gene called the SRY (sex-determining region on Y) gene.
