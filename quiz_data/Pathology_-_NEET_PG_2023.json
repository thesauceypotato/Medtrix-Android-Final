      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Strychnine poisoning Strychnine poisoning can be fatal to humans and other animals and can occur by inhalation, swallowing or absorption through eyes or mouth. It produces some of the most dramatic and painful symptoms of any known toxic reaction, making it quite noticeable and a common choice for assassinations .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The given clinical vignette suggests the diagnosis of strychnine poisoning. Strychnine poisoning occurs if a person ingests crushed seeds of Strychnos nux vomica . If swallowed uncrushed, the seeds of nux vomica have no poisonous action. The fatal dose is 15-30 mg of strychnine or one crushed seed. Strychnine is a competitive antagonist of glycine at the postganglionic receptors in the motor neurons of the anterior horn of the spinal cord . This leads to increased activity in the motor neurons. Patients typically present with convulsions which are clonic initially but eventually become tonic. Risus sardonicus results from the contraction of the jaws and facial muscles in which the corners of the mouth are drawn back. The convulsions are most marked in anti- gravity muscles so that the body typically arches in hyperextension, the posture known as opisthotonus .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Datura poisoning : Datura poisoning causes respiratory depression, arrhythmias, fever, delirium, hallucinations, psychosis, and even death if taken internally. Datura stramonium is a hallucinogenic plant which causes serious poisoning. Option C. Aspirin poisoning  : Salicylate poisoning, also known as aspirin poisoning, is the acute or chronic poisoning with a salicylate such as aspirin. The classic symptoms are ringing in the ears, nausea, abdominal pain, and a fast breathing rate. Complications can include swelling of the brain or lungs, seizures, low blood sugar, or cardiac arrest. Option D. Organophosphate poisoning : Organophosphates are used as insecticides, medications, and nerve agents. Symptoms include increased saliva and tear production, diarrhea, vomiting, small pupils, sweating, muscle tremors, and confusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Feature Strychnine Tetanus History Of poisoning (may be) Injury (usually available) Onset of symptoms Sudden Gradual Early symptoms Uneasiness, Restlessness Lock jaw Relaxation in between spasms Complete Never complete Fatal period Few hours Several days Chemical analysis Poison + No poison</p>\n<p></p>",

Podocytes cover the walls of glomerular capillaries, interdigitating with each other and forming narrow slits between their projections.

Alcoholic hepatitis:It is also less likely because although chronic alcoholism is associated with alcoholic hepatitis, the elevated AFP level is not typically seen in this condition. Alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by inflammation of the liver due to chronic alcohol consumption, but it does not typically present with significantly elevated AFP levels. Option D.

The next step in his management should be flow cytometry.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a peripheral B-cell neoplasm usually affecting adults, more commonly men. Patients are often asymptomatic at diagnosis. When symptomatic, it presents non-specifically with easy fatigability, weight loss, and anorexia. Generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are present in most symptomatic patients. The chromosomal defects in CLL include Deletion of 13g (commonest and has a good prognosis) Deletion of 11q Trisomy 12q Deletion of 17p (poor prognosis) The peripheral blood smear in cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) contains small round lymphocytes having condensed chromatin and scant cytoplasm. Some of these cells may get disrupted while preparing the smears, producing smudge cells. An absolute lymphocyte count of >5000/mm\u00b2 is required for diagnosis . Hypogammaglobulinemia is commonly seen, making the patient susceptible to infections.

It may be considered in certain high-risk patients or those with refractory disease, but only after confirming the diagnosis and assessing the disease stage.

Flow cytometry is the preferred diagnostic method. Option D: Start high-dose chemotherapy - This is not the first step in managing CLL. Treatment decisions should be based on clinical stage, prognostic factors, and the patient's overall health.
