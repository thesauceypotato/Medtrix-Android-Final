      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>An ipsilateral paracentral disc herniation at L4-L5 An ipsilateral paracentral disc herniation at L4-L5, most commonly results in L5 radiculopathy and thus weakness of the gluteus medius.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>A Trendelenburg gait results from weakness of the gluteus medius, which is innervated by the L5 nerve root. A paracentral disc herniation at L4-L5 most commonly results in L5 radiculopathy and thus weakness of the gluteus medius. A paracentral herniation at L5-S1 most commonly affects the S1 nerve root. A paracentral herniation at L3-L4, a central herniation at L3-L4, and a far lateral herniation at L4-L5 all affect the L4 root. Trendelenburg's test: This is a test to establish the stability of the hip. A hip is stable if the abduction mechanism of the hip is effective in preventing the pelvis from dipping on the opposite side, when weight is borne on the limb. The test and its explanation are as follows: Trendelenburg's test. (a) The patient stands on the normal limb, the opposite ASIS goes up. (b) The patient stands on the affected limb, the opposite ASIS dips down. Box shows the abductor mechanism Test: The ASISS of both sides should be exposed. The patient is asked to stand on the normal leg. As he does so, the opposite ASIS will be lifted up i.e., the pelvis will be tilted towards the side bearing weight (Fig-2). Now, the patient is asked to stand on the affected side. If the hip on this side is not stable, the opposite ASIS will dip down. In order to avoid falling, the patient will tilt his torso to the affected side and thus balance himself. Explanation: When a person stands on both legs, the centre of gravity falls in between the two feet (the base). As soon as one leg is lifted off the ground, the centre of gravity of the body falls outside the base (single foot this time). The pelvis on the opposite side tends to dip. This is prevented by the balancing done by the body by tilting the pelvis toward the side on which the person is standing. The tilting is possible due to 'effective contraction' of the abductor muscles of the hip (mainly gluteus medius). This abductor mechanism can be compared to a lever (Fig-2. box). The fulcrum of the lever is the centre of the hip, the load is the weight of the body trying to tilt the pelvis down. This load is counter-acted by the abductor muscle force which acts through the lever-arm (the neck of the femur). Any failure in the effectivity of the abductor mechanism causes dipping of the ASIS on the opposite (normal) side. This could occur if: (a) there is no fulcrum-e.g., dislocation of the hip, destruction of the head; (b) ineffective lever-arm (the neck of the femur) - e.g., fracture of the neck of the femur; (c) ineffective contraction of abductor muscles - e.g., weakness of the muscles due to polio or abductor muscles acting ineffectively through a short lever-arm (as in coxa vara).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. A Trendelenburg gait results from weakness of the gluteus medius, which is innervated by the L5 nerve root. A central disc herniation at L3-L4 is less likely to cause L5 compression Option: B. An ipsilateral paracentral disc herniation at L3-L4 affects L4 not L5 Option: D. A paracentral herniation at L5-S1 most commonly affects the S1 nerve root.</p>\n<p></p>",

Complications of Pelvic Fracture Injury to urethra Injury to bladder Injury to rectum or vagina Injury to diaphragm Injury to nerves - lumbosacral plexus Injury to major vessels - a common iliac artery and its branches</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>COMPLICATIONS Rupture of urethra : This is commonly associated in cases where wide disruption of symphysis pubis and pubic rami fractures is present. The urethra in males is more commonly injured - membranous urethra being the commonest site. The rupture may be complete or incomplete, partial thickness or full thickness. Diagnosis may be made by three cardinal signs of urethral injury i.e., blood per urethra, perineal haematoma and distended bladder. Treatment: It may be possible to pass a catheter gently in a case with partial and incomplete urethral tear. In case this fails, the help of a uro-surgeon should be sought. Principles of treatment are: (i) drainage of the bladder by suprapubic cystostomy; and (ii) micturating cysto-urethrogram after 6 weeks to assess the severity of urethral stricture, and treatment accordingly Rupture of bladder: The bladder is ruptured in pubic symphysis disruption or pubic rami fractures. In case the bladder is full at the time of injury, the rupture is usually extra-peritoneal, and urine extravasates into perivesical space. Diagnosis may be suspected if a patient has not passed urine for a long time after the fracture. Catheterisation may be successful but only a few drops of blood- stained urine come out. A cysto-urethrogram will distinguish between a bladder and a urethral rupture. Treatment: An urgent operation is required, preferably by a urologist. The principles of treatment are: (i) to repair the rent in the bladder; (ii) drainage of the bladder by an indwelling catheter, and (ii) to drain the urine in the prevesical space. Injury to rectum or vagina : There may be disruption of the perineum with damage to the rectum or vagina. General surgeons and gynaecologists suitably manage these injuries Injury to major vessels: This is a rare but serious complication of a pelvic fracture. The common iliac artery or one of its branches may be damaged by a spike of bone. Aggressive management is crucial. If facilities are available, embolisation of the bleeding vessel under X-ray control is a good procedure. In other cases, the vessel is explored surgically and ligated or repaired. Injury to nerves: In case of major disruption of the pelvic ring with marked vertical displacement of half of the pelvis, it is common for the nerves of the lumbo-sacral plexus to be injured. The damage may be caused by a fragment pressing on the nerves, or by stretching. Treatment is conservative. Recovery occurs in some cases, but in most the injury is irreversible and the consequent paralysis permanent. Rupture of the diaphragm: A traumatic rupture of the diaphragm sometimes occurs in cases with severely displaced pelvic fractures. It is worthwhile getting an X-ray of the chest in case a patient with pelvic fracture complains of breathing trouble or pain in the upper abdomen. Treatment is by surgical repair</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. It's a complication of pelvic fracture. Option: B.

Indications: There is a considerable diversity of opinion regarding indications for arthroplasty. Broadly, it is used for painful joints where joint mobility is desirable. It is commonly performed for: (i) osteoarthritis of the hip and knee; (ii) ankylosis of the elbow; and (iii) un-united femoral neck fracture. Types of arthroplasty : There are three types of arthroplasty in general use. Excision arthroplasty: In this type, one or both of the articular ends are excised so that a gap is created between them. The fibrous tissue that fills this gap, by virtue of its flexibility, provides movement at the joint. Commonly this is performed for the hip and elbow. Hemiarthroplasty or half joint replacement: In this type, only one of the articulating surfaces is removed and is replaced by a prosthesis of a similar type. The prosthesis is made of metal, silicon or rubber. Commonly, it is performed for fractures of the neck of the femur in elderly people (eg. Austin-Moore hemiarthroplasty). (Details on pages 136). c. Total replacement arthroplasty: Both the apposing articulating surfaces are excised and replaced by prosthetic components. Commonly, it is performed for hip osteoarthritis - Total hip replacement (THR). (Details on page 339).
