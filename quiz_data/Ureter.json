Thus, following blockage of the portal vein, portal blood may enter the superior vena cava via the azygos system. Other important portocaval connections include the superior rectal vein with the middle and inferior rectal veins; paraumbilical and epigastric veins (engorgement of these vessels results in caput-medusae); and the colic and splenic veins with renal veins and veins of the posterior body wall. The gonadal veins exclusively drain the gonads (although in the female, the ovarian vein communicates with the uterovaginal plexus). These vessels have no anastomoses with portal veins. The internal iliac veins, which drain most of the pelvis and much of the inferior extremities, have no demonstrated portal anastomoses. The splenic vein is incorrect because it is a component of the portal venous system. The vesical venous plexus, situated well within the pelvis and drains the bladder and the prostate (or uterus and vagina),1 has no association with portal vessels.</p>\n<p></p>",
