      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>CPD Engagement is said to occur when the greatest transverse diameter of the presenting part, has passed through the pelvic inlet. In all cephalic presentations, the greatest transverse diameter is always biparietal. Engagement occurs in multipara with the commencement of labour in the late Ist stage after rupturing of membranes and in nullipara during the last few weeks of pregnancy, e. \u2248 38 weeks. In primi, the most common cause of non-engagement at term is the deflexed head or occipitoposterior position followed by cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD). Since deflexed head or occipitoposterior is not given an option, we will go for CPD as the answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Causes of non-engagement of the head at term: Deflexed head bringing the larger diameter to engage.

The slope of the pelvic floor: Two halves of levator ani fibres run backwards and toward the midline. Thus, during each contraction, the head, occiput in particular, in a well-flexed position, stretches the levator ani, particularly that half which is in relation to the occiput. After the contraction passes off, elastic recoil of the levator ani occurs bringing the occiput forward toward the midline . The process is repeated until the occiput is placed anteriorly. This is called rotation by the law of the pelvic floor (Hart\u2019s rule). Option B. Law of unequal flexibility: The internal rotation is primarily due to inequalities in the flexibility of the component parts of the fetus. Option C. Pelvic shape: Forward inclination of the side walls of the cavity, narrow bispinous diameter and long anteroposterior diameter of the outlet result in putting the long axis of the head to accommodate the maximum available diameter.

Uterine distension: Uterine stretch increases gap junction proteins, receptors for oxytocin and specific contraction-associated proteins (CAPs). Option: B. Fetoplacental contribution: It plays a very important role as fetal ACTH acts on fetal adrenal glands which leads to increased cortisol secretion and in turn increases the production of estrogen and progesterone from the placenta. Option: C. Prostaglandins from amnion, chorion, decidual cells, and myometrium. Prostaglandins enhance gap junction (the intermembranous gap between two cells through which stimulus flows) formation.</p>\n<p></p>",
