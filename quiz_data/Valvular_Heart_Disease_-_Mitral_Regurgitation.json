Her murmur is very quiet and short. In the setting of acute, severe valvular regurgitant lesions, the pressure gradient between the two chambers (in this case the aorta and left ventricle) quickly equilibrates during the regurgitant period . In this case, the goal is to reduce the regurgitant volume and thus increase effective stroke volume (total stroke volume \u2013 regurgitant volume). Nitroprusside will reduce systemic vascular resistance, and thus reduce the driving pressure for regurgitation. Careful administration of nitroprusside, often with concomitant invasive hemodynamic monitoring, may stabilize organ perfusion and allow surgical correction.

Interventions that increase systemic vascular resistance (vasopressin or norepinephrine) will increase regurgitant volume- and blood outflow will decrease. Option: B .

However, suddenly, he becomes severely short of breath and manifests signs of acute pulmonary edema. On auscultation, you can now appreciate a soft, short apical systolic murmur (in addition to his prior-appreciated murmur of aortic stenosis) that was not present previously. You suspect that he has suffered a ruptured mitral valve chordae and now has severe, acute mitral regurgitation.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Ejection fraction Ejection fraction (EF), however, will increase as the LV will be better able to contract in the state of relatively lower afterload. This highlights a misconception that higher EF is \u201calways better.\u201d Left ventricular EF is highly dependent not only on the contractile state of the ventricle but also on its afterload state. This patient is in a precarious situation and likely will require emergent surgical intervention to survive. The combination of severe obstruction to left ventricular (LV) outflow (severe aortic stenosis) and acute, severe regurgitant mitral valve disorder will inevitably lead to intractable pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock unless both structural abnormalities are corrected.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. The aortic valve gradient will decline merely because there is less volume going across the aortic valve with each contraction. Option: B. Likewise, since both catheter-derived and echocardiographic- derived calculations of aortic valve area are dependent on the gradient for calculation, they will decline . Option: C. Likewise, with more of the stroke volume going ineffectively into the left atrium, the effective stroke volume (total stroke volume \u2013 regurgitant volume) will decline .</p>\n<p></p>",
