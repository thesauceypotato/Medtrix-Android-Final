Paroxysmal AF is often initiated by small reentrant or rapidly firing foci in sleeves of atrial muscle that extend into the pulmonary veins (PV).

Initial management of atrial flutter includes electrical cardioversion or rate control drugs. For a first episode, no antiarrhythmic drug is needed for rhythm control (i.e. conversion to sinus rhythm) For recurrent episodes, antiarrhythmic drug therapy with sotalol, dofetilide, disopyramide, and amiodarone may be used.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. For recurrent episodes of common atrial flutter, catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus abolishes the arrhythmia in >90% of patients sawtooth flutter waves in leads II, III, and aVF and positive P waves in lead V1. Option: B. Electrical cardioversion is warranted for hemodynamic instability or severe symptoms. Option: C.
