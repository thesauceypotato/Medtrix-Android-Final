Chronic kidney disease refers to a reduction in renal function regardless of etiology and degree of dysfunction. As nephrons are damaged, renal function and GFR decreases and biomarkers such as creatinine are used to identify the extent of disease. Levels of BUN and creatinine show dramatic changes only after total GFR decreases to 50 percent. Initially, nephrons show adaptability.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. - Inulin clearance decreases with decreases in GFR Option: C. - There is normocytic normochromic anemia due to a decrease in erythropoietin.
