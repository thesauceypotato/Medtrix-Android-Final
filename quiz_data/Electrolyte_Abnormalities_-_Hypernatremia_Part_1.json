      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Central diabetes mellitus There are 3 main types of polyuria polydipsia syndrome, namely, central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. In addition, gestational diabetes insipidus can occur owing to increased arginine vasopressin metabolism during pregnancy. Copeptin, the C-terminal segment of the arginine vasopressin prohormone, is an easy-to-measure arginine vasopressin surrogate. Copeptin can be used as a reliable biomarker to discriminate between different forms of the polyuria polydipsia syndrome, therefore the osmotic stimulated copeptin levels will probably replace the classical water deprivation test in the future. Copeptin measurement upon osmotic stimulation with hypertonic saline or upon nonosmotic stimulation improves the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. Treatment of central diabetes insipidus includes Desmopressin which is the treatment of choice, in oral or nasal form. Now, as per the algorithm shown above, This patient has a random copeptin <21.4 pmol/l With a stimulated copeptin level of <3.8 pmol/l Therefore this is a case of central diabetes insipidus</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hypernatremic patients with NDI \u2192 High serum AVP and copeptin.
