Rare since the introduction of vaccination. The younger the fetus when infected the more severe the illness. In the first 2 months of gestation, there is an up to 85% chance of being affected by either multiple defects or abortion. third month \u2013 30% chance of developing a single defect (e.g. deafness) 10% in the fourth month and nil after 20 weeks. Temporary defects include low birthweight, low platelets, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatitis, meningitis, and jaundice. Permanent defects include hearing loss, cardiac abnormalities, microcephaly, inguinal hernia, cataract, and glaucoma. Developmental defects may become apparent as the infant grows, e.g. myopia, mental retardation, diabetes, and behavioural and language disorders.</p>\n<p></p>",

This phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) occurs when virus-antibody complexes bind to the Fc gamma R via the Fc portion of the Ig. As the dengue virus has many serotypes, the previous infection with one serotype can cause catastrophic consequences if the patient is infected with another serotype due to the sub-optimal neutralization of the new serotype virus by the previous serotype antibodies. This is an important phenomenon with dengue vaccines. Therefore these vaccines are used only in extremely endemic countries where the pros of the vaccine outweigh the cons.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dengue haemorrhagic fever On secondary infection of the dengue virus, the exaggerated immune response can be seen due to antibody-dependent enhancement resulting in more tissue damage and virus replication. This is a known phenomenon with dengue virus secondary infection. This causes Dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>It is known that antibodies to dengue viruses at sub-neutralizing concentrations enhance dengue virus infection of Fc gamma R+ cells. This phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) occurs when virus-antibody complexes bind to the Fc gamma R via the Fc portion of the Ig. As the dengue virus has many serotypes, the previous infection with one serotype can cause catastrophic consequences if the patient is infected with another serotype due to the sub-optimal neutralization of the new serotype virus by the previous serotype antibodies. This is ALSO an important phenomenon with dengue vaccines. Therefore these vaccines are used only in extremely endemic countries where the pros of the vaccine outweigh the cons.</p>\n<p></p>",
