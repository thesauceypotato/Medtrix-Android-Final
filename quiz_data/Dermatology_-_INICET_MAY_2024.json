During the test: Application : Small amounts of potential allergens are applied to the skin, usually on the back, using adhesive patches. Observation : The patches are left on the skin for 48 hours, after which they are removed, and the skin is examined for reactions. A follow-up examination is often done at 72 or 96 hours. Interpretation : A positive reaction, indicated by redness, swelling, or vesicles at the site, suggests that the substance is a cause of allergic contact dermatitis. Slit Skin Smear - Leprosy A Slit Skin Smear is a diagnostic procedure used to detect the presence of Mycobacterium leprae , the bacterium responsible for leprosy. The procedure involves: Collection : A small incision or slit is made in the skin, usually on earlobes, elbows, or lesions, and a small sample of tissue fluid is collected. Staining and Examination : The sample is stained using Ziehl-Neelsen staining and examined under a microscope. Result : The presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in the smear indicates infection with Mycobacterium leprae . Biopsy - Lupus Vulgaris Lupus Vulgaris is a form of cutaneous tuberculosis. A skin biopsy is performed to diagnose the condition. The process involves: Procedure : A small piece of skin tissue is removed from the lesion using a biopsy needle or scalpel. Histopathological Examination : The tissue sample is examined under a microscope for characteristic histological features, such as granulomas, giant cells, and necrosis. Diagnosis : The presence of these histological features, along with clinical correlation and special stains for acid-fast bacilli, supports the diagnosis of lupus vulgaris. KOH Mount - Tinea Corporis KOH (Potassium Hydroxide) Mount is a simple diagnostic test used to identify fungal infections, such as Tinea Corporis (ringworm). The process involves: Sample Collection : A scraping is taken from the edge of a skin lesion. Preparation : The sample is placed on a slide with a few drops of potassium hydroxide solution. Microscopic Examination : The KOH dissolves keratin in the skin cells, making it easier to visualize fungal elements under the microscope. Result : The presence of hyphae or spores confirms a fungal infection, specifically dermatophytes causing tinea corporis.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Gonorrhoeae Drug resistance is primarily associated with Gonorrhoeae Gonorrhea : This sexually transmitted infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae has increasingly shown resistance to multiple antibiotics over time. This resistance includes to commonly used treatments like penicillins, tetracyclines, and more recently, to cephalosporins, making it a significant concern in managing the infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Donovanosis : Caused by Klebsiella granulomatis, it is generally sensitive to antibiotics like azithromycin or doxycycline, and resistance is not a major issue. Option: B. Syphilis : Caused by Treponema pallidum, it is effectively treated with benzathine penicillin, and drug resistance is not a significant problem. Option: D. Chancroid : Caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, resistance is not a widespread issue, and it is typically treated with antibiotics like azithromycin or ceftriaxone. Thus, gonorrhoeae is notably associated with drug resistance, making it the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Syndromic management of STI Kit no.
