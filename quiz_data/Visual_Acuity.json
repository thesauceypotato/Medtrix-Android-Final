The lesion almost always is associated with compression at the level of optic chiasma and causes heteronymous hemianopia (bitemporal hemianopia). Heteronymous hemianopia is the loss of half of the visual field on different sides in both eyes. It is separated into two categories: Binasal hemianopia: the loss of the fields surrounding the nose. Bitemporal hemianopia: the loss of the fields closest to the temples.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Optic chiasma lesions Central -bitemporal hemianopia Pituitary adenoma -bitemporal superior quadrantanopia Craniopharyngioma -bitemporal inferior quadrantanopia Lateral -binasal hemianopia Proximal optic nerve injury causes junctional scotoma</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - A ,B and C are incorrect option.
