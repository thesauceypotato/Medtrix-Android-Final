      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Nearest the oval window The feature of the traveling wave is that it travels fast along the initial portion of the basilar membrane but becomes progressively slower as it goes farther into the cochlea .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The cause of this difference is the high coefficient of elasticity of the basilar fibers near the oval window and a progressively decreasing coefficient farther along the membrane. This rapid initial transmission of the wave allows the high-frequency sounds to travel far enough into the cochlea to spread out and separate from one another on the basilar membrane. Without this rapid initial transmission, all the high-frequency waves would be bunched together within the first millimeter or so of the basilar membrane, and their frequencies could not be discriminated against.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The portion of the basilar membrane vibrated by a sound depends on the frequency of the sound. High-frequency sounds produce a vibration of the basilar membrane at the base of the cochlea (near the oval and round windows); low-frequency sounds produce a vibration of the basilar membrane at the apex of the cochlea (near the helicotrema) The modiolus is the bony center of the cochlea from which the basilar membrane emerges, the spiral ganglion contains the cell bodies of the auditory nerve fibers, and the stria vascularis is the vascular bed located on the outer wall of the scala media of the cochlea responsible for endolymph secretion.</p>\n<p></p>",
