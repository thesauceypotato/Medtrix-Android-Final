The role of prolactin around ovulation is less pronounced compared to its surge after delivery, where it is critical for initiating and sustaining lactation.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 24 hours after ovulation</li><li>\u2022 Option C. NREM Sleep : Prolactin levels naturally rise during sleep, especially during the deeper stages of NREM sleep, due to reduced dopamine activity, which normally inhibits prolactin secretion. Despite this increase, the levels achieved during sleep are usually not as high as those observed after childbirth, where prolactin plays a direct and significant role in breastfeeding.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. NREM Sleep</li><li>\u2022 Option D. After running for 1 hour : Physical activities and stress can lead to an increase in prolactin levels as part of the body's response to physiological stress or exertion. However, these increases are generally transient and significantly lower than the sustained high levels required for lactation post-delivery.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

As the night progresses and sleep deepens, dopamine levels decrease, leading to a decrease in the inhibition of prolactin release. Consequently, prolactin levels rise, reaching their peak in the early morning hours.</li><li>\u27a4 Prolactinoma: The most common cause of hyperprolactinemia is a noncancerous tumour of the pituitary gland called a prolactinoma.</li><li>\u27a4 Prolactinoma:</li><li>\u27a4 Medications: Certain medications can increase prolactin levels.
