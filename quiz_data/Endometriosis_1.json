For the diagnosis of rectal endometriosis, TVS is highly operator-dependent, and experience is often lacking. Option D - Magnetic Imaging Resonance: MR imaging may clarify anatomy for equivocal sonographic findings and offers superior resolution at soft tissue interfaces.

These refluxed endometrial fragments invade the peritoneal mesothelium and develop a blood supply for implant survival and growth. Supporting data include a report that surgical obliteration of the outflow tract in baboons induces endometriosis. Importantly, however, most women have retrograde menstruation.

Option A: Lymphatic spread: Lymphatic spread of endometriosis to pelvic sentinel lymph nodes is noted in affected women. Findings of endometriosis in unusual locations, such as the groin, is the reason to bolster this theory Option B: Coelomic metaplasia: coelomic metaplasia theory suggests that the parietal peritoneum is pluripotent and can undergo metaplastic transformation to tissue histologically identical to normal endometrium. Because the ovary and the progenitor of the endometrium, the m\u00fcllerian ducts, are both derived from coelomic epithelium, such metaplasia may help explain endometriosis involving the ovary. This process may also underlie cases of endometriosis in those without menstruation, such as premenarchal girls and males treated with estrogen and orchiectomy for prostate cancer. Option D: Abnormal differentiation of Mullerian \u00fcllerian remnants . This theory purports that Mullerian remnants left along their embryonic path undergo abnormal differentiation.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Adenomyosis Hysteroscopy is the endoscopic technique of visualizing the interior of the uterus directly. It is both diagnostic and therapeutic.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hysteroscopy is the endoscopic technique of visualizing the interior of the uterus directly. It is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Patient Preparation: In premenopausal women, hysteroscopy is ideally performed in the early proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, when the endometrium is relatively thin. This allows small masses to be easily identified and removed. Alternatively, agents like progestins, combined pills, danazol, and GnRH agonist can be administered prior to anticipated surgery. The cervix has to be dilated to 4 mm for the insertion of hysteroscopes. Distension media: Because the anterior and posterior uterine walls are in apposition, a distention medium is required to expand the endometrial cavity for viewing. Distension media includes CO2, saline, and low viscous fluids such as sorbitol, mannitol, and glycine solutions. To expand the cavity, the intrauterine pressure of these media must reach 45 to 80 mmHg. It should not exceed 100mmHg because high pressure can result in increased intravasation of the medium into the patient\u2019s circulation and fluid volume overload. Contraindications: Infection (except in case of misplaced IUCD) Pregnancy Genital malignancy A hysteroscopy can visualize the interior of the uterus so, it can diagnose: Any congenital malformation of the uterus can also help in differentiating between a bicornuate uterus from a septate uterus. Any uterine synechiae (as in asherman syndrome). Misplaced IUCD. Submucous fibroid A hysteroscope can visualize the cornua so, it can diagnose: Any cornual pathology Hysteroscope can directly visualize the endometrium so, it can diagnose: Endometrial lesions like \u2013 endometrial polyp, endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial cancer, and endometrial TB. Pregnancy-related conditions like: Molar tissue or products of conception. Besides these hysteroscopy is also indicated in: Unexplained abnormal uterine bleeding Premenopausal Postmenopausal Selected infertility cases: In the case of Abnormal HSG Unexplained infertility Recurrent spontaneous abortion The therapeutic indications of hysteroscope are To excise uterine septum To lyse adhesions in Ashermann\u2019s syndrome To retrieve lost IUCD Hysteroscopic myomectomy Polypectomy Endometrial ablation for menorrhagia Tubal occlusion for control of fertility Intratubal ballooning in tubal blockage</p>\n<p></p>",
