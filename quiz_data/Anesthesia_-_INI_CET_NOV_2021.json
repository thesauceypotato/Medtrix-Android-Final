      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>10L Nasal cannulae Deliver 24-30% oxygen Flow rate 1-4L/min (4L will dry the nose, 2L is more comfortable) Used in non-acute situations or if only mildly hypoxic (e.g. saturations stable at 92% in a patient without lung disease) Hudson mask Delivers 30-40% oxygen Flow rate 5-10L/min Venturi mask Delivers 24-60% oxygen Types: BLUE = 2-4L/min = 24% O2 WHITE = 4-6L/min = 28% O2 YELLOW = 8-10L/min = 35% O2 RED = 10-12L/min = 40% O2 GREEN = 12-15L/min = 60% O2 Often used in COPD , where it is important not to over-oxygenate the patient. Non-rebreather mask Delivers 85-90% oxygen 15L flow rate Bag on mask with valves stopping almost all rebreathing of expired air Used for acutely unwell patients Note that saturations should be maintained at 94-98%, not 100%. Do not keep patients on 15L for longer than necessary as over-oxygenating for prolonged periods can be harmful</p>\n<p></p>",

So, chest tube drainage should be reserved only for life-threatening cases. Conservative measures like 100 % oxygen, and reducing intra abdominal pressure improve the hypoxia and are sufficient to manage pneumothorax by CO2 in most cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. In CO2 embolism ETCO2 will show a rise followed by a fall. Moreover, there will not be an increase in airway pressures. Option B. In bronchospasm generally, ETCO2 remains normal, only the graph shows a shark fin pattern. Moreover, hypotension will not be seen in bronchospasm. Option C. ETCO2 will rise and show bifid pattern in endobronchial intubation.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Sevoflurane Sevoflurane has the smoothest induction, therefore, is the inhalational agent of choice for induction in children. All inhalational agents are used for maintenance. In rare cases, particularly neonates, infants, and patients with neuromuscular diseases patients are directly intubated without muscle relaxants under the effect of volatile agents Difference between sevoflurane and isoflurane : Aspect Sevoflurane Isoflurane Onset of Action Rapid onset of action. Slightly slower onset compared to sevoflurane. Blood-Gas Solubility Low blood-gas solubility, leading to rapid emergence from anesthesia. Moderate blood-gas solubility, slightly longer emergence time compared to sevoflurane. Irritation and Odor Generally has a pleasant odor and is less irritating to airways. Characteristic odor and Considered slightly more irritating than sevoflurane. Use in Pediatrics Commonly used in pediatric anesthesia due to its rapid induction and emergence properties. Also used in pediatric anesthesia but  have a slightly longer emergence time. Special Considerations Known for low pungency and lower potential for airway irritation. May require a higher fresh gas flow rate due to its higher blood-gas solubility.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A- Isoflurane has unpleasant induction therefore cannot be used for induction and intubation Option B- Desflurane also has irritation induction therefore cannot be sued for induction and intubation Option D- Halothane has got pleasant induction however at high doses needed for intubation it is highly toxic</p>\n<p></p>",
