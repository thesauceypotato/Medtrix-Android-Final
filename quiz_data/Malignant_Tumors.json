In the absence of other findings, a metastatic carcinoma involving bone should be suspected. In addition, parathyroid hormone-related peptides elaborated by neoplasms can be a cause of hypercalcemia or malignancy.

Chondrosarcoma can occur over a wide age range, but these focal lesions involving bone are not likely to elevate serum calcium. Option: B. Gouty arthritis may be accompanied by some local bone destruction, but without a marked increase in serum calcium and the lesions are typically in peripheral joints. Option: D.
