The surgical team discusses the advantages, limitations, and technical considerations of robotic surgery. Which of the following statements about robotic surgery is true? Robotic-assisted surgery eliminates the need for pneumoperitoneum, making it safer for patients with cardiopulmonary compromise. The master-slave telemanipulation system allows the surgeon to control robotic arms with enhanced precision and motion scaling. Robotic surgery provides 3D high-definition vision, wristed instruments with 7 degrees of freedom, and tremor filtration. Haptic feedback is a major advantage of current robotic systems, allowing the surgeon to feel tissue resistance. Robotic surgery is associated with shorter hospital stays, less blood loss, and faster recovery compared to open surgery.",
