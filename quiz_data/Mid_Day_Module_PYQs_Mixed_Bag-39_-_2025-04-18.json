Adhesive otitis media:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Tympanosclerosis: Tympanosclerosis involves the formation of calcium plaques within the fibrous layer of the tympanic membrane or middle ear due to recurrent infections.

B) Total Laryngectomy with Neck Dissection.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The clinical presentation (hoarseness of voice, weight loss) and the laryngoscopic findings (ulceroproliferative growth with fixed vocal cord) suggest advanced glottic carcinoma. The fixed vocal cord indicates at least T3 stage, as it suggests tumor infiltration into the paraglottic space or fixation due to deeper invasion. Weight loss in an elderly patient further supports an advanced stage malignancy.</li><li>\u2022 This is the preferred treatment for T3 or T4 laryngeal cancers, especially when the vocal cords are fixed, and there is a high likelihood of regional spread. If the patient has significant lymph node involvement or is symptomatic (e.g., weight loss), a neck dissection is warranted along with total laryngectomy.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Radical Radiotherapy: Radical radiotherapy is usually preferred for early-stage laryngeal cancers (T1 or T2) with mobile vocal cords. It is less effective for advanced stages (T3 or T4) due to higher chances of recurrence.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Radical Radiotherapy:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy alone is not the primary treatment for advanced laryngeal carcinoma unless the patient is unsuitable for surgery or radiation. It is primarily used for palliative care or in cases with distant metastasis.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Chemotherapy:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Concurrent Chemoradiation: Concurrent chemoradiation is a consideration for organ preservation in advanced laryngeal cancers. However, for patients with a fixed vocal cord and significant weight loss, total laryngectomy provides better local control and survival outcomes.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Concurrent Chemoradiation:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 For advanced glottic carcinoma with vocal cord fixation (T3/T4) and evidence of regional spread, the best treatment option is Total Laryngectomy with Neck Dissection.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
