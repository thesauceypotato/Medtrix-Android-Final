The m ucociliary mechanism is compromised in this case, due to immotile cilia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mucociliary mechanism A mucous blanket consists of a superficial mucus layer and a deeper serous layer, floating on the top of cilia, constantly beating to carry it like a \u201cconveyer belt\u201d towards the nasopharynx. It moves at a speed of 5\u201310 mm/min and the complete sheet of mucus is cleared into the pharynx every 10\u201320 min. The inspired bacteria, viruses, and dust particles are entrapped on the viscous mucous blanket and then carried to the nasopharynx to be swallowed. cilia beat 10\u201320 times per second at room temperature. They have a rapid \u201ceffective stroke\u201d and a slow \u201crecovery stroke.\u201d In the former, the extended cilia reach the mucus layer. At the same time, in the recovery stroke, they bend and travel slowly in the reverse direction in the thin serous layer, thus moving the mucous blanket in only one direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In immotile cilia syndrome, cilia are defective and cannot beat effectively, leading to stagnation of mucus in the nose and sinuses and bronchi causing chronic rhinosinusitis and bronchiectasis.</p>\n<p></p>",

It can result from nasal obstruction due to nasal polypi, enlarged turbinates, or oedema of mucous membrane as in common cold, allergic or vasomotor rhinitis. Option: B. Phantosmia is an olfactory hallucination which makes you detect smells that aren't really there in your environment. Option: D. Olfactory agnosia is an inability to recognize odour sensations despite olfactory processing, language, and intellectual function intact.</p>\n<p></p>",
