Hyaluronic acid is the only GAG that is not synthesized by the Golgi apparatus. It is formed at the plasma membrane. Statement: B. True GAGs are polymers made of tandem repeats of amino sugar and uronic acid These amino sugars present are N acetyl glucosamine and N acetyl galactosamine and are highly sulfated while uronic acids are glucuronic acid and Iduronic acid. Keratan sulfate is only GAG without any uronic acid. Statement: C . True GAGs are found in ECM. In bone and cartilage, they provide strength and flexibility (Hyaluronic acid, Chondroitin Sulfate) In the eyes they are responsible for the transparency of the cornea (keratan sulfate) Heparin is the only GAG that is present intracellularly. Statement: D. False GAGs are highly sulfated and have number of carboxy, sulfate and acetyl group which provide a large negative charge on them. The repulsion of these charges makes them slimy and slippery. Due to these charges, GAGs can hold a lot of water, so hygroscopic in nature. Statement: E.  True GAGs are attached to proteins, therefore called Proteoglycans. On the Hyaluronic acid backbone, many core proteins and link proteins are attached. Linear GAG chains of Amino sugars and Uronic acid (tandem repeats) are covalently attached to core proteins by a core trisaccharide (Galactose-Galactose-Xylose).</p>\n<p></p>",

Reducing sugars can donate H (e - ) to these cupric ions to reduce them to cuprous (Cu 1+ ) which combines with oxygen to form cuprous oxide (CuO) which forms small to large size starch. The color of these CuO precipitates depends on the size and is either yellow (small size ppt) or Red (large size ppt). Depending on the amount of red CuO formed, we will see different colors in the tube. But these colors can only tell the approximate amount of sugar. So, it\u2019s a semi-quantitative test.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Sucrose Sugars may be called reducing or non-reducing based on their ability to reduce copper during Benedict\u2019s test. The reducing property of sugar is based on the presence of free aldehyde or ketone group in them. Most monosaccharides and disaccharides are reducing sugars, while Sucrose & Trehalose is a non-reducing sugar. In contrast to reducing sugars, sucrose & trehalose do not contain free anomeric carbon atoms therefore a non-reducing sugar.</p>\n<p></p>",
