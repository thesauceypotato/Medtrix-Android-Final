      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Aerobic glycolysis In cancer cells, pyruvate is converted to lactate even in the presence of O 2 . This is known as the Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis. Lactic acid makes the local environment acidic helping in metastasis. Energy derived from the conversion of pyruvate to lactate is just 2 ATPs, so, cancer cells take up a large amount of glucose compared to normal cells. This leads to glucose wastage by cells and weight loss (cachexia).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B: Anaerobic glycolysis The glycolysis occurring under the absence of oxygen is known as anaerobic glycolysis e.g. glycolysis in exercising muscle. This process also produces lactic acid as the end-product by converting pyruvate to lactate using the enzyme LDH and regenerates NAD from NADH that is required to keep the glycolysis going. Option C: Inhibition of glycolysis by oxygen This is known as Pasteur\u2019s effect. In this effect, in the presence of oxygen, anaerobic glycolysis (simply known as glycolysis) is inhibited. It saves the wastage of glucose. Option D: Inhibition of oxygen uptake by glycolysis This is known as the Crabtree effect and is mainly observed in ethanol-fermenting yeast such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When the O2 supply is kept constant & glucose concentration is increased, then the O 2 consumption by cell falls.</p>\n<p></p>",

One may argue that fructose enters glycolysis bypassing the energy investment step (fructose-1-phosphate to fructose 1,6 bisphosphate) and thus 1 ATP should be obtained extra. but one extra ATP is used for the conversion of glyceraldehyde to GAP. So, ATP consumption (total 2 per fructose) is the same as glycolysis of glucose. Look at the ATP used in kinase reaction in the image when fructose enters glycolysis. Hence Net ATP yield is also 4 ATP produced- 2 ATP used = 2 ATPs</p>\n<p></p>",

In the red blood cells, which lack mitochondria, this is the only pathway through which NADPH can be generated. In the absence of NADPH, the molecule which protects against oxidative damage (glutathione) is oxidized preferentially to protect membrane lipids and proteins. There is only limited glutathione in the membrane, so once it is oxidized, it needs to be converted back to reduced glutathione (the protective form). The enzyme that does this, glutathione reductase, requires NADPH to supply the electrons to reduce the oxidized glutathione. In the absence of NADPH, the glutathione cannot be reduced (Option D is false) , and the protection offered by reduced glutathione is eliminated, leading to membrane damage and cell lysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- In G6PD deficiency, there will be no effect on NADH as this enzyme does not produce or use NADH.

Now to complete the non-oxidative phase, at least three molecules of ribulose-5-P need to enter this phase (see fig in treasure attached). To form three ribulose-5-P, 3 glucose 6-P will need to be oxidized initially out of which 2 molecules are recovered again at the end. Hence, the total reaction of HMP pathway can be written as: So, in net reaction, a single molecule of glucose is broken into glyceraldehyde-3-P and 3 CO2 and 6 NADPH or, for a complete cycle with 3glucose-6-P molecules, 6NADPH are produced Or we can say, the final products of HMP are 6NADPH.</p>\n<p></p>",
