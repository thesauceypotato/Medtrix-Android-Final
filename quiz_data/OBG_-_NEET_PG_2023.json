Parity is defined as the number of times that she has given birth to a fetus with a gestational age of 24 weeks or more , regardless of whether the child was born alive or was stillborn. For example, a woman who is described as 'gravida 2, para 2 (sometimes abbreviated to G2 P2) has had two pregnancies and two deliveries after 24 weeks, and a woman who is described as 'gravida 2, para 0' (G2 P0) has had two pregnancies, neither of which survived to a gestational age of 24 weeks. If they are both currently pregnant again, these women would have an obstetric history of G3 P2 and G3 P0 respectively. Sometimes a suffix is added to indicate the number of miscarriages or terminations a woman has had. So if the second woman had had two miscarriages, it could be annotated G3 P0+2. A nulliparous woman (nullip) has not given birth previously (regardless of outcome). A primigravida is in her first pregnancy. A primiparous woman has given birth once. A multigravida has been pregnant more than once. A multiparous woman (multip) has given birth more than once.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options A, C and D are false.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>A grand multipara is a woman who has already delivered five or more infants who have achieved a gestational age of 24 weeks or more, and such women are traditionally considered to be at higher risk than the average in subsequent pregnancies. A grand multigravida has been pregnant five times or more. A great grand multipara has delivered seven or more infants beyond 24 weeks of gestation. A more elaborate coding system used is GTPAL (G = gravidity, T = term deliveries, P = preterm deliveries, A = abortions or miscarriages, L = live births).</p>\n<p></p>",
