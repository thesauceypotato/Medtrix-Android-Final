Near the lumen, the lateral margins of the cells are united by prominent junctional complexes. More basally the lateral margins are separated by enlarged intercellular spaces into which complex folds of plasma membrane extend. Numerous blood capillaries are present near the bases of the cells. These features indicate that bile is concentrated by the absorption of water at the luminal surface of the cell. This water is poured out of the cell into basal intercellular spaces from where it passes into blood. Absorption of salt and water from bile into the blood is facilitated by the presence of Na+ and K+ ATPases in cell membranes of cells lining the gallbladder.</p>\n<p></p>",
