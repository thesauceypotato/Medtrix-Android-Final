ATLL is a neoplasm driven by HTLV-1, Often contracted through the breast milk of infected mothers. There are 4 common variants- acute(60%),lymphomatous(20%),chronic(15%) and smoldering(5%) . Most common presentations include hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions and opportunistic infections. Combination chemotherapy is generally used. Other active agents in this disease include the antiretroviral agent zidovudine, interferon \u03b1, and arsenic. In non-responders to therapy, allogeneic stem cell transplants should be considered.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A.
