      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>A receives touch sensations from the upper limbs, and B receives touch sensations from the lower limbs. The gracile fasciculus carries sensory information from the lower half of the body entering the spinal cord at the lumbar level. The cuneate fasciculus carries sensory information from the upper half of the body (upper limbs, trunk, and neck) entering the spinal cord at the cervical level. They both relay into their respective nucleus.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The Romberg test, tests the function of the Dorsal Column Medial Lemniscal Pathway, the neural pathways by which sensory information from the peripheral nerves is transmitted to the cerebral cortex.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options C and D . Touch sensations are carried by lateral spinothalamic tracts and not anterior spinothalamic tracts.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The finger-nose test is used to assess the coordinated, target-driven movement of the upper limb; this is lost in the context of cerebellar pathology.</p>\n<p></p>",
