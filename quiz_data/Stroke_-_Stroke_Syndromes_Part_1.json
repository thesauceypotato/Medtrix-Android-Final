Diagnosis- Bubble-contrast echocardiography (IV injection of agitated saline coupled with either transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography ) can demonstrate a right-to-left cardiac shunt , revealing the conduit for paradoxical embolization. Alternatively, a right-to-left shunt is implied if immediately following IV injection of agitated saline, the ultrasound signature of bubbles is observed during transcranial Doppler insonation of the MCA; pulmonary arteriovenous malformations should be considered if this test is positive yet an echocardiogram fails to reveal an intracardiac shunt. Both techniques are highly sensitive for the detection of right-to-left shunts. Etiology- Venous clot, fat and tumour emboli, bacterial endocarditis, IV air, and amniotic fluid emboli at childbirth. The importance of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) as a cause of stroke is debated, particularly because they are present in ~15% of the general population. The presence of a venous source of embolus, most commonly a deep-venous thrombus, may provide confirmation of the importance of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with an accompanying right-to-left shunt in a particular case. Meta-analysis of three recent randomized trials reported a hazard ratio of 0.41 for recurrent stroke (about a 1% per year absolute reduction) using percutaneous occlusion devices in patients with no other explanation for their stroke. Guidelines now endorse patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure with percutaneous devices after consultation with a neurologist and a cardiologist.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A, B.

However, in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke , anticoagulants have minimal or no role .

Stroke centers -Stroke centres use clinical pathways and staff are dedicated to stroke patients . This can be beneficial to the patient. It can reduce the mortality rate of patient care in stroke units followed by rehabilitation services improves neurologic outcomes and reduces mortality. The use of clinical pathways and staff dedicated to stroke patients can improve care. Option D. rehabilitation -Proper rehabilitation of stroke patients includes early physical, occupational and speech therapy .
