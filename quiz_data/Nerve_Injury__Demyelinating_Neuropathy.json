      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy Onion bulb appearance on nerve biopsy is a characteristic feature of chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP). The onion bulb appearance is seen on nerve biopsy due to the presence of multiple concentric layers of Schwann cells around the nerve fibers. This is a result of the process of demyelination and remyelination that occurs in CIDP.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>CIDP- Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy It is a chronic, immune-mediated neuropathy that affects peripheral nerves, causing weakness and sensory loss. Presentation: Progressive, symmetric, and proximal muscle weakness with sensory symptoms in a stocking-glove distribution . Diagnosis: Nerve conduction studies and nerve biopsy Treatment: Corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and plasma exchange.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option:A. Autoimmune neuropathy: Autoimmune neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by damage to the peripheral nerves due to an autoimmune response. The typical histological findings in autoimmune neuropathy include lymphocytic infiltration, axonal degeneration, and segmental demyelination. Option:C. Vasculitis-associated neuropathy: Vasculitis is a group of disorders characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels. Vasculitis-associated neuropathy can affect both the peripheral and central nervous systems. The typical histological findings in vasculitis-associated neuropathy include perivascular inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Option:D. Toxic neuropathy: It is caused by exposure to toxic substances, such as heavy metals, solvents, and drugs. The typical histological findings in toxic neuropathy include axonal degeneration, segmental demyelination, and fiber loss. neuropathy.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Different variants of CIDP Variant Description Typical CIDP Symmetric, progressive, proximal, and distal muscle weakness, and sensory symptoms Atypical CIDP CIDP with atypical features such as asymmetric involvement or more focal presentation Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) Purely motor neuropathy with asymmetric weakness and partial conduction block Sensory CIDP CIDP with predominant sensory symptoms Distal acquired demyelinating symmetric neuropathy (DADS) CIDP with predominant distal symptoms Lewis-Sumner syndrome (LSS) Asymmetric or multifocal neuropathy with predominant distal involvement and conduction block Chronic immune sensory polyradiculopathy (CISP) Chronic sensory ataxic neuropathy with anti-GD1b antibodies IgG4-associated neuropathy (IgG4-RD) CIDP-like neuropathy associated with IgG4-related disease</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Difference between Myasthenia Gravis and Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic\n     Syndrome Characteristics Myasthenia Gravis Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome Incidence Most common NMJ disorder Typically occurs in young <40 years old More common in females Uncommon Typically occurs in old >40 years old More common in males Pathophysiology Postsynaptic transmission defect Autoantibodies to postsynaptic ACh\n       receptor Presynaptic transmission defect Autoantibodies to pre-synaptic Ca2+\n       channels Muscle weakness pattern Weakness worsens with sustained activity EMG on repetitive nerve stimulation shows the decremental response Weakness improves with sustained activity EMG on repetitive nerve stimulation shows\n       the incremental response Reflexes Spared reflexes Hyporeflexia Associated conditions Thymus abnormalities present in 75% of patients Associated with small cell lung cancer in 50% of\n  patients AChE inhibitor administration Reverses symptoms Minimal effect</p>\n<p></p>",
