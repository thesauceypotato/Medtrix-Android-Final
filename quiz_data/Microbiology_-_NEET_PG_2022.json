Hence, it is essential to differentiate between these lesions. The given image shows oral mucosal white patches with malignancy potential that cannot be scraped off which is a significant pointer for oral Leukoplakia. Associated conditions: squamous cell carcinoma Risk factors: Tobacco use Alcohol use Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection Histopathology of oral leukoplakia often reveals hyperkeratosis or parakeratosis with varying degrees of inflammation. Hyperplastic epithelium may be present, in addition to mild, moderate, or severe dysplasia. Differentials: Oral hairy leukoplakia Differentiating factors: seen in immunocompromised patients and caused by Epstein-Barr virus Pseudomembranous candidiasis] Differentiating factors: can be scraped off</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Oral submucous fibrosis is a separate entity that is caused specifically by betel nut use. Chronic betel quid use results in submucosal fibrosis, leading to progressive oral cavity scarring leading to ulceration, xerostomia, trismus, dysphagia, or odynophagia. Oral submucous fibrosis may present in isolation but can also be found concurrently with leukoplakia or Erythroplakia. It is characterized by abnormal collagen deposition. It is a precancerous disorder and transforms into a malignant tumor in 1.5\u201315% of all cases. Erythroplakia often has similar features on histological evaluation, including varying degrees of dysplasia; Erythroplakia lesions harbor carcinoma more frequently than leukoplakic lesions. Leukoplakia will present as a white patch or plaque in the oral cavity, which cannot be wiped off, whereas Erythroplakia may present as a firm red patch or plaque; both are usually non-tender lesions. The lesion can be diffuse or well-circumscribed and may involve the wet border of the lip, floor of the mouth, oral tongue, or buccal mucosa. Malakoplakia is a rare inflammatory condition that typically occurs in immunocompromised individuals and is thought to be secondary to a bactericidal defect in macrophages. Malakoplakia typically affects the urinary tract, but the involvement of nearly every organ system has been reported.</p>\n<p></p>",

The B subunit is responsible for binding to the monoganglioside GM1 receptor on intestinal epithelial cells. The A subunit is responsible for activation of adenylate cyclase located on the basolateral cellular membrane. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) activates protein kinase A, which causes the opening of ion channels in the membrane, leading to chloride and bicarbonate secretion by intestinal crypt cells and disruption in absorption by villus cells. V. cholerae also produces additional toxins that may contribute to diseases, including the zonula occludens toxin, that alter intestinal permeability by acting on intestinal epithelial cell tight junctions, and the accessory cholera enterotoxin.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B: GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of pathologies characterized by GM2 ganglioside accumulation into the lysosome due to mutations on the genes encoding for the \u03b2-hexosaminidases subunits or the GM2 activator protein.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Trichophyton Rubrum Trichophyton rubrum is a dermatophytic fungus in the phylum Ascomycota. It is an exclusively clonal, anthropophilic saprotroph that colonizes the upper layers of dead skin, and is the most common cause of athlete's foot, fungal infection of nail, jock itch, and ringworm worldwide. The colonies are velvety and contain deep red velvety pigment on their reverse side. Trichophyton rubrum grows slowly in culture with sparse production of teardrop or peg-shaped microconidia laterally on fertile hyphae . Macroconidia, when present, are smooth-walled and narrowly club-shaped, although most isolates lack macroconidia . Growth is inhibited in the presence of certain sulfur-, nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing compounds. Pencil shaped macroconidia are typically seen. Approximately 80\u201393% of chronic dermatophyte infections in many parts of the developed world are thought to be caused by rubrum including cases of tinea pedis(foot), tinea unguium(nail), tinea manum (hand), tinea cruris(groin), and tinea corporis(arms and leg), as well as some cases of tinea barbae(beard). Trichophyton rubrum has also been known to cause folliculitis in which case it is characterized by fungal element in follicles and foreign body giant cells in the dermis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. violaceum is a slow growing organism with waxy (and not velvety unlike in T. rubrum) colonies that produce purple pigmentation (hence the name). It is an anthropophilic dermatophyte causing mainly tinea capitis, a fungal infection of the scalp occurring particularly in children and adolescents , and occasionally tinea corporis. Option: C. Trichophyton tonsurans may be identified through analysis of its fast-growing colonies. Colonies tend to be flat, powdery, and yellow with a reddish undercolour. It develops into a folded colony, and may vary in colour On Sabouraud agar the fungus grows peripherally and develops into a flatter, creamy disk with raised edges. Trichophyton tonsurans also produces many inflated, pear-shaped microconidia , borne on matchstick-like stalks. Trichophyton tonsurans is the most common causal organism of tinea capitis, representing greater than 90% of cases; followed by Microsporum canis , and M . audouinii . The disease varies from noninflamed scaling patches to inflamed, pustule-studded plaques (kerion) that may leave scars. Tinea capitis can appear as seborrheic-like dermatitis with minimal inflammation, patchy alopecia with broken hair shafts leaving residual black stumps (\u201cblack dot\u201d ringworm). Occipital lymph nodes are often present. A more severe infection with indurated, boggy plaques (kerion) covered with pustules and crusting, accompanied by lymphadenopathy , can result in scarring. Option: D. - Trichophyton Schoenleinii   - Favus or tinea favosa is in most cases a severe form of tinea capitis. It is caused by the dermatophyte fungus Trichophyton schoenleinii and results in a honeycomb destruction of the hair shaft. Although rare, it may sometimes occur as onychomycosis, tinea barbae, or tinea corporis.</p>\n<p></p>",
