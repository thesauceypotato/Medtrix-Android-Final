It is caused by the hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the Pylorus, which results in constriction and obstruction of the gastric outlet. First-born male infants are at the highest risk for developing CHPS. Projectile, non-bilious vomiting is a common symptom in infants with CHPS. A palpable olive-shaped mass is usually felt in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, and visible peristalsis can be observed moving from left to right, followed by projectile vomiting. Infants with CHPS develop a characteristic metabolic abnormality including hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria. Loss of hydrochloric acid leads to metabolic alkalosis and hypochloremia due to persistent vomiting. The kidneys try to compensate for alkalosis by secreting Na+ and HCO3, but the loss of sodium stimulates aldosterone secretion leading to the loss of potassium ions (hypokalemia). Loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH resulting in paradoxical aciduria. Treatment involves rehydration and correction of metabolic abnormalities before surgery, and the Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is the standard surgical procedure for CHPS.</li><li>\u27a4 CHPS (congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis) is most commonly seen in infants between 2 to 8 weeks of age.</li><li>\u27a4 It is caused by the hypertrophy of the circular muscle of the Pylorus, which results in constriction and obstruction of the gastric outlet.</li><li>\u27a4 First-born male infants are at the highest risk for developing CHPS.</li><li>\u27a4 Projectile, non-bilious vomiting is a common symptom in infants with CHPS.</li><li>\u27a4 A palpable olive-shaped mass is usually felt in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, and visible peristalsis can be observed moving from left to right, followed by projectile vomiting.</li><li>\u27a4 Infants with CHPS develop a characteristic metabolic abnormality including hypokalemic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria.</li><li>\u27a4 Loss of hydrochloric acid leads to metabolic alkalosis and hypochloremia due to persistent vomiting.</li><li>\u27a4 The kidneys try to compensate for alkalosis by secreting Na+ and HCO3, but the loss of sodium stimulates aldosterone secretion leading to the loss of potassium ions (hypokalemia).</li><li>\u27a4 Loss of H+ ions in urine lowers the urinary pH resulting in paradoxical aciduria.</li><li>\u27a4 Treatment involves rehydration and correction of metabolic abnormalities before surgery, and the Ramstedt pyloromyotomy is the standard surgical procedure for CHPS.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. A. CMV esophagitis</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 CMV (Cytomegalovirus) esophagitis is an infection of the esophagus caused by the Cytomegalovirus. It predominantly affects immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS or transplant recipients. The characteristic endoscopic finding in CMV esophagitis is the presence of large, linear or serpiginous (snake-like) ulcers, often located in the distal esophagus. These ulcers typically have well-defined edges and are surrounded by relatively normal mucosa, which helps to differentiate them from other types of esophagitis.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Candida Esophagitis: Candida esophagitis is a fungal infection caused by Candida species, most commonly Candida albicans. It is common in immunocompromised patients or those on prolonged antibiotics or inhaled steroids. Endoscopic findings typically show white-yellow plaques or patches that can be scraped off, often described as having a \"cottage cheese-like\" appearance, rather than serpiginous ulcers.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Candida Esophagitis:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Herpetic Esophagitis: Herpetic esophagitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and can affect both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. It is characterized by odynophagia (painful swallowing) and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Endoscopically, herpetic esophagitis usually presents with small, well-circumscribed ulcers that resemble \"volcano-like\" or \"punched-out\" lesions, which are different from the serpiginous ulcers seen in CMV esophagitis.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Herpetic Esophagitis:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Radiation Esophagitis: Radiation esophagitis is a side effect of radiation therapy, particularly for cancers in the chest area, such as lung cancer. It manifests with symptoms like pain, difficulty swallowing, and a sensation of something stuck in the throat. Endoscopic findings may include mucosal redness, swelling, and non-specific ulcerations, but not the distinct serpiginous ulcers typical of CMV esophagitis.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Radiation Esophagitis:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Serpiginous ulcers in the esophagus observed during endoscopy are characteristic of CMV esophagitis, especially in immunocompromised patients. This feature helps differentiate it from other forms of esophagitis such as Candida, herpetic, and radiation-induced esophagitis.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

This approach balances the need to prevent excessive bleeding during surgery while managing the risk of thromboembolic complications.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options</li><li>\u2022 Other Options</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 0.5-0.8 : This range is too low for general surgical preparation and would indicate a significant reversal of anticoagulation, which is not typically required.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 0.5-0.8</li><li>\u2022 Option C. 1.5-2 : While this range might be acceptable for some minor procedures, major surgeries generally require an INR of less than 1.5 to ensure safety.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. 1.5-2</li><li>\u2022 Option D. 2-3 : This range is appropriate for therapeutic anticoagulation but is too high for surgical procedures due to the increased risk of bleeding.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. 2-3</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objectives:</li><li>\u27a4 For patients on warfarin undergoing major surgery, the target INR should be less than 1.5 to minimize bleeding risk.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
