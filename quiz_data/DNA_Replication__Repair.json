      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>DNA polymerase I DNA polymerases are the main enzymes involved in DNA replication. In prokaryotes such as E. coli, there are three DNA polymerases named DNA polymerase I, II, and III performing different functions. Other enzymes required for replication include helicase, topoisomerases, primase, and ligase. Before polymerization can occur, the two parental DNA strands are unwounded using helicase for cutting and topoisomerases by removing supercoiling. As DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the exiting chain hence a short RNA primer is synthesized by primase enzyme using DNA as a template. One primer is required for the leading strand, but multiple primers are required for the lagging strand. The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the 5\u2019 \u2192 3\u2019 direction (See Fig.) and it needs only one RNA primer while the lagging strand is synthesized in short stretches in the 5\u2019 \u2192 3\u2019 direction and requires many RNA primers. After the proofreading, DNA polymerase I remove RNA primers by 5\u2019-3\u2019exonuclease activity and fills the gap by synthesizing DNA using 5\u2019-3\u2019 polymerase activity. DNA ligase catalyzes the formation of a phosphodiester bond between DNA synthesized by DNA polymerase III and that formed by DNA polymerase I using energy (ATP).</p>\n<p></p>",
