      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>It facilitates mucosal adherence of bacteria This patient most likely has disseminated gonorrheal infection (a triad of arthritis, dermatitis, and tenosynovitis in a sexually active woman) due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In mucosal regions as well as in secretions, lgA exists in its secretory form, composed of an IgA dimer joined by a peptide J chain) and a peptide secretory component. lgA antibodies usually bind to pili and other membrane proteins involved in bacterial adherence to the mucosa , thus inhibiting mucosal colonization by the microorganism. Certain bacteria (eg, N. gonorrhoeae, N. Meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae) produce lgA proteases that cleave lgA at its hinge region (yielding Fab and compromised Fc fragments), thus decreasing its effectiveness. This facilitates bacterial adherence to the mucosa (possibly due to easier bacterial access to the mucosal surface or immune disguise by binding to released Fab fragments, among others).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B: IgA is a weak activator of the classic complement pathway. Impairment of complement-mediated cell lysis can be accomplished by staphylococcal protein A, which binds the Fc portion of lgG, preventing complement fixation. Option C: Although lgA Fc-mediated functions such as opsonization are compromised by lgA protease, secretory IgA is a poor opsonin. Impairment of opsonization and phagocytosis is most frequently accomplished by encapsulated bacteria such as S pneumoniae, N meningitidis, and H influenzae. Option D: IgA does not play a role in the induction of memory lymphocytes necessary for mounting a secondary immune response (which requires the formation of memory B and T lymphocytes after initial antigen exposure).</p>\n<p></p>",

The diagnosis is confirmed when the organism is isolated on Thayer-Martin media, chocolate agar infused with antibiotics. N gonorrhoeae is spread primarily via infected genital secretions during sexual contact. Therefore, most cases can be prevented by the consistent use of condoms, which act as a mucosal barrier between sexual partners. Patients with genitourinary N gonorrhoeae infections may have purulent cervicitis or urethritis, but many are asymptomatic.

However, it is not associated with tendonitis/pustules, and spirochetes cannot be cultured on Thayer-Martin media. Option B: N gonorrhoeae undergoes a dramatic antigenic variation of its surface molecules, which prevents the formation of protective antibodies against future infection. this phenomenon is associated with repeated infections when exposure occurs.

Some STDs/STIs, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, etc can be passed from mother to infant perinatally.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum, an infection of the eye in newborns, is acquired during passage through an infected birth canal. The initial conjunctivitis rapidly progresses and, if untreated, results in blindness. To prevent gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum, the instillation of erythromycin ointment into the conjunctival sac of newborns is done in many developed countries. Neonatal chlamydial infection , which manifests principally as ophthalmia neonatorum (ON) or pneumonia , is a significant cause of neonatal morbidity. Widespread use of silver nitrate drops resulted in a dramatic decline in the incidence of gonococcal ophthalmia but had much less impact on the incidence of neonatal chlamydial infection. Chlamydia trachomatis has become the most common infectious cause of ON in developed countries. Prophylaxis with 0.5% erythromycin ophthalmic ointment or 1% tetracycline ointment has comparable efficacy for the prevention of chlamydial ophthalmia.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - Syphilis is not responsible for any congenital eye infection. Options C and D - Herpes is transmitted perinatally but it does not cause any eye infection per se. It can cause vesicles near the eye. PID is not transmitted in utero and neither does it cause eye infection. HPV is not associated with any neonatal ophthalmic infection.</p>\n<p></p>",
