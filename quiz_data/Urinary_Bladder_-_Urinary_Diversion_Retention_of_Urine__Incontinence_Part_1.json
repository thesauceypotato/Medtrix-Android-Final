      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Beetroot consumption Consumption of large quantities of beetroot can result in red discolouration of the urine. This discolouration is due to the excretion of betalain (betacyanin) pigments such as betanin.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Discolouration of the urine : Many drugs and foodstuffs have been reported to produce abnormal discolouration of the urine. Most colours have been reported but the most frequently encountered clinically are red/orange and brown. Red Urine : Haematuria, the presence of haem in the urine also produces red discolouration and generates a positive dipstick test. Red urine discolouration due to haemoglobinuria may present in haemolytic disorders such as \u2018march haematuria\u2019, classically seen in dehydrated soldiers after prolonged marching. Likewise, myoglobinuria due to myocyte destruction, e.g. caused by rhabdomyolysis after crush injury or compartment syndrome, can also result in red discolouration of the urine. Disordered haem production, seen in porphyria, can result in red discolouration that may change to brown or purple with exposure to sunlight. Consumption of large quantities of beetroot can result in red discolouration of the urine. This discolouration is due to the excretion of betalain (betacyanin) pigments such as betanin. Red/Orange Urine : Several medications can cause red/ orange discolouration of the urine, most commonly rifampicin, isoniazid or phenazopyridine. Others include chlorpromazine, thioridazine, senna and laxatives containing a phenolphthalein component. Brown Urine : The commonly used antibiotics nitrofurantoin and metronidazole can lead to brown urine. Brown urine due to high levels of circulating bilirubin is a feature of obstructive jaundice</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Options: A, B, D. The commonly used antibiotics nitrofurantoin and metronidazole can lead to the urine being discoloured  brown. Brown urine due to high-circulating bilirubin is also a feature of obstructive jaundice.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>White urine is a complaint seen in two distinct conditions. One is in young men who may report the presence of a white substance in urine. This substance is usually semen and requires no treatment other than reassurance. The second condition is chyluria where lymphatic fluid, from channels obstructed by filarial inflammation, leaks into the renal pelvicalyceal system</p>\n<p></p>",

It is important to image the patient after drainage of contrast because the full bladder may mask extravasation</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Bladder rupture: This can be intraperitoneal (20%) or extraperitoneal (80%). Intraperitoneal rupture is usually secondary to a blow or falls on a distended bladder, and more rarely to surgical damage. Extraperitoneal rupture is caused by blunt trauma or surgical damage. Gross haematuria can be absent. It may be difficult to distinguish extraperitoneal rupture from rupture of the membranous urethra. Intraperitoneal rupture is associated with sudden severe pain in the hypogastrium, often accompanied by syncope. The shock subsides and the abdomen distends and there is no desire to micturate. Peritonitis does not follow immediately if the urine is sterile; varying degrees of rigidity is present on examination. Investigations : Retrograde cystogram or CT cystogram confirms the diagnosis and identifies whether the injury is intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal. Postdrainage views should be obtained as a small amount of contrast extravasation may be missed with a full bladder. With intraperitoneal perforation, contrast is seen to outline loops of bowel</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Intravenous urography (IVU) may confirm a leak. Option: B. Computed tomography (CT) is ideal. Plain erect radiographs may show a ground-glass appearance (fluid).</p>\n<p></p>",
