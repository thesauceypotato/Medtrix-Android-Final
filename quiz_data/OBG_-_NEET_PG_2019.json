It may be related to repeated childbirth, vigorous curettage or excess estrogen effect. There is a diffuse symmetrical enlargement of the uterus. Uterine endometriosis was observed frequently in elderly women, symmetrically enlarged around 14 weeks. The clinical symptoms of adenomyosis include menometrorrhagia (irregular and heavy menses), colicky dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and pelvic pain , particularly during the premenstrual period. There are foci of hemorrhagic cysts within the uterine wall. IOC is MRI. NSAIDs are commonly used to control pain and bleeding. Definitive treatment is surgical. The presence of functioning endometrium in sites other than uterine much is called endometriosis. Sites include ovaries, pelvic peritoneum, pouch of Douglas, uterosacral ligaments, umbilicus etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options B, C and D are false.</p>\n<p></p>",

Therefore, cloxacillin and its congeners tend to treat cellulitis well, but they are less effective in eradicating adenitis, the most likely precursor of breast abscess. When patients are allergic to penicillins, cephalexin or clindamycin may be the alternative to erythromycin. Combinations like co-amoxiclav should be avoided because of fear of inducing MRSA.

A partial hydatidiform mole can be identified by ultrasound showing placenta tissue, some hygromatous cysts, and some fetal oddities, but no clear fetus structure. Ultrasound is strictly an indicator. After spontaneous abortion or dilation and curettage, tissue needs to be examined by pathology and cytogenetics needs to be determined. If a triploid karyotype is determined as 69XXX, 69XXY, or 69 XYY, then a partial mole can be confirmed. Complete Mole Complete moles have a 46XX karyotype (85%), the molar chromosomes are derived entirely from the father. The ovum nucleus may be either absent (empty ovum) or inactivated which has been fertilized by a haploid sperm. It then duplicates its own chromosomes after meiosis. This phenomenon is known as Infrequently, the chromosomal pattern may be 46XY or 45X.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options A, B and C are false.</p>\n<p></p>",

It\u2019s a common condition in postmenopausal women because as estrogen levels drop , the tissue that lines the vagina becomes thinner and more easily damaged. Women with atrophic vaginitis may also experience vaginal itching, burning, frequent urination, or vaginal discharge. Women can treat this condition topically with estrogen creams, tablets (Vagifem), or an estrogen-releasing ring placed in the vagina (Estring). Oral estrogen, available with a doctor\u2019s prescription, will also restore vaginal tissue. Vaginal lubricants offer an alternative for women wary of using estrogen.

The double decidual sign consists of two echogenic rings surrounding the hypoechoic gestational sac. The inner ring represents the chorion, embryonic disc and decidua capsularis. The outer ring represents the decidua parietalis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options B, C and D are false.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Intrauterine GS should be seen by TVS when the maternal serum \u03b2-hCG level is 1,000\u20131,200 mIU/mL and by TAS with the level of \u03b2-hCG 6,000 mIU/mL. The presence of a yolk sac or fetal pole within the gestation sac confirms pregnancy. True gestational sac size increases by 1 mm/day. The pseudo gestational sac or pseudo sac is irregular in outline, usually centrally located in the uterus, has no double decidua sign and the sac remains empty.</p>\n<p></p>",
