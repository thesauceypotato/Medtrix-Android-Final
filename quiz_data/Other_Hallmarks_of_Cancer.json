      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>No evidence of systemic inflammation</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Cancer cachexia: Cancer cachexia is a hypercatabolic state defined by a loss of muscle mass (with or without loss of fat) that cannot be explained by diminished food intake . Individuals with cancer commonly suffer progressive loss of body fat and lean body mass accompanied by profound weakness, anorexia, and anemia , referred to as cachexia . Cancer cachexia is associated with the following: Equal loss of both fat and lean muscle Elevated basal metabolic rate Evidence of systemic inflammation Inflammation related to the interplay between cancer and the immune system will likely have a role. The precise causes of cancer cachexia are unknown, but inflammatory mediators, particularly TNF\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6 , appear to have essential roles.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Equal loss of both fat and lean muscle. True . Option: B. Elevated basal metabolic rate. True . Option: D. TNF\u03b1 (cachectin) plays an important role. True .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>TNF\u03b1 (known initially as cachectin ) is a leading suspect among several mediators released from immune cells that may contribute to cachexia. However, it must also be recognized that therapies directed against individual cytokines (e.g., TNF) in cancer patients have not been effective in reversing cachexia, suggesting that either an assortment of inflammatory cytokines, or other factors entirely, are also involved in its pathogenesis.</p>\n<p></p>",
