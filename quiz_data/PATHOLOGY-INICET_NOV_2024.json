Each zone has its own architectural and stromal features. Stroma The prostate's stroma is fibromuscular, meaning it contains smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, blood vessels, and nerves. The stroma surrounds the glandular tissue, or parenchyma. Epithelial lining The ducts and acini of the prostate are lined with secretory epithelium. The glandular epithelium is mostly simple columnar and cuboidal epithelial cells, but may also have regions of pseudostratified columnar epithelium. Basal cells A layer of basal cells is present beneath the secretory lining in each zone. These are small, round stem cells that rest on the basement membrane.

If a tourniquet is needed, tie and release as soon as sample is collected Syringe filling Errors can occur if the syringe is not filled to its nominal volume, especially for small specimens. Sample handling Errors can occur if the sample is contaminated, hemolyzed, or inappropriately mixed. Dietary intake : Ionized calcium levels can decrease by about 5% within 2 hours of eating. Physical activity : Moderate-intensity physical activity can increase ionized calcium levels. Circadian rhythm : Ionized calcium dosage is strongly associated with circadian rhythm. pH : pH levels can affect ionized calcium levels by impacting how it complexes with proteins and other anions.</p>\n<p></p>",
