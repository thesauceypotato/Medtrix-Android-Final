Pain was aggravated when bending forward or in reaching out position. In his history, he had a back condition from birth and later had an accident that resulted in fracture of the lumbar vertebrae. His MRI two months prior to this aggravation, showed degeneration of L1, disc degeneration, and protrusion of the disc at the S1 level. He was prescribed strong non-steroid pain medication that made him feel drowsy, but did not provide a full pain relief. Seeking resolution for his pain, he decided to try InterX therapy and treatment was aimed at whole Lumbosacral zone, dermatomes L1/L2 and L4, L5, S1-S3, left buttock, right buttock, left back of the knee. After two and a half weeks use, he reported no pain, no discomfort, he stopped taking pain medication and started with the core exercise program to stabilize the lumbar spine. Advice to limit driving, prolong sitting, rest, good nutrition, and gentle stretching exercises. Six months follow up confirmed that the patient still did not have pain, actively working and travelling. All of the following anatomical statements are true about this case except:",
