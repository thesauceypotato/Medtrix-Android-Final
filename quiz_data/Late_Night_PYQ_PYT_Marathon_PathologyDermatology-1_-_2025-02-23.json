These abnormal inclusions represent accumulations of mucopolysaccharides (glycosaminoglycans) within the cytoplasm of these cells. Mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of inherited lysosomal storage disorders characterized by defective degradation of glycosaminoglycans due to enzyme deficiencies, leading to their accumulation in various tissues including blood cells.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.
