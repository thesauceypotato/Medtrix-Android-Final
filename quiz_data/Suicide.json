      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Electroconvulsive therapy after admission. The patient is having severe depression and suicidal risk . In this case, the first choice of management is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and it\u2019s always preferable to admit a patient with active suicide ideation and then give it instead of giving ECT on an outpatient basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A \u2013 Though antidepressants are the first-line agents for the management of depression, they are slow to work and aren\u2019t of much use in an acutely suicidal patient. Option B - Behavior therapy can be tried along with antidepressants in the long run once the patient is not at risk for suicide. Option D- ECT is done after admission of the patient.</p>\n<p></p>",
