Langerin (CD 207) is a Langerhans cell specific c type lectin which is localized to Birbeck granules and act as a endocytic receptor for antigen processing. Proliferation of Langerhans cells is termed as Histiocytosis X/eosinophilic granuloma and if presents as systemic disease; is termed as Letterer-Siwe disease /Hand-Sch\u00fcller-Christian disease.</p>\n<p></p>",

All types of Burkitt lymphoma are characterized by dysregulation of the c-myc gene by one of three chromosomal translocations . This gene is found at 8q24 . The most common variant is t(8;14), which accounts for about 85% of cases. Also, t(2;8). t(8;22) The c-myc gene found on chromosome 8 is part of the MYC family of genes that serve as regulators of cellular transcription and is associated with Burkitt lymphoma. Expression of the c-myc gene results in the synthesis of transcriptional factors that increase the expression of other genes involved in aerobic glycolysis . Ultimately, an increase in aerobic glycolysis plays a role in providing the necessary energy for cellular growth to occur. The translocation of the c-myc gene to the IGH, IGK, or IGL region moves the gene to a location in the genome near immunoglobulin enhancers which increases the expression of the c-myc gene. Overall, this translocation leads to increased cellular proliferation that is found in Burkitt lymphoma.

Delayed-type hypersensitivity and granuloma play a major role in tissue damage observed during infections with slow-growing intracellular organisms, such as M. tuberculosis (tuberculosis), M. leprae (leprosy) and H. capsulatum. Type IV hypersensitivity reactions, also known as delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, are mediated by antigen-specific effector T cells. They are distinguished from other hypersensitivity reactions by the lag time from exposure to the antigen until the response is evident (1 to 3 days). Antigen is taken up, processed, and presented by macrophages or dendritic cells. Type 1 helper T (T H 1) effector cells that recognize the specific antigen (these are scarce and take time to arrive) are stimulated to release chemokines , which recruit macrophages to the site and release cytokines that mediate tissue injury. IFN-\u03b3 activates macrophages and enhances their release of inflammatory mediators, whereas TNF-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b2 activate endothelial cells, enhance vascular permeability , and damage local tissue. The prototypical type IV hypersensitivity reaction is the tuberculin test.</p>\n<p></p>",

All are correct Colon cancer can be prevented by Metformin : True . Some studies have suggested a potential preventive effect of Metformin against colon cancer. However, more research is needed to establish it as a definitive preventive measure. Right and left colon cancers can have different clinical presentations: This statement is true . Right-sided colon cancers and left-sided colon cancers can have distinct clinical features due to variations in tumor location, blood supply, and anatomical characteristics. Colon cancers can be hereditary: This statement is true . Certain colon cancers can have a hereditary component, such as those associated with genetic syndromes like familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC/Lynch syndrome), as well as specific genetic mutations. Colon cancers frequently metastasize to the liver: This statement is true .

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Bone marrow biopsy Chloroma/ myeloid sarcoma is an extramedullary manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia (solid tumor) that is caused by an abnormal proliferation of immature precursors of white blood cells (myeobasts). Definitive diagnosis of a chloroma requires biopsy of the lesion in question. However, in this case where orbita involvement is seen, BM biopsy should also be done. This is because Orbital involvement is uncommon and primary orbital presentation without any evidence of systemic involvement is rare. Also, PBS may or may not be a/w pathologic findings; thus making bone marrow biopsy and aspiration essential. Ocular structures can be involved in AML via two distinct mechanisms. Direct infiltration of leukemic cells may occur as anterior segment uveal infiltration, orbital infiltration, or central nervous system (CNS) involvement with neuro-ophthalmic signs which is known as primary involvement . Hematologic abnormalities seen in leukemia leads to secondary involvement. Anemia and thrombocytopenia can produce tissue ischemia and hemorrhage, while leukostasis and immunosuppression may predispose to occlusion injury and infection, respectively. Chloroma may develop at any age even though nearly 60 % of cases are seen in children under 15 years of age with a median age of 7 years old. Myeloid sarcoma-associated AML is more frequently seen in boys than girls. In the pediatric population, acute leukemias account for about 30 % of the malignancies in which acute leukemia accounts for about 15 %.</p>\n<p></p>",

Changes in the permeability of the tumor cell membranes or necrosis of tumor cells may release enzymes into the circulation, but in such cases one should expect other enzymes to be as markedly elevated as LDH. Yolk sac tumor:  HCG AFP and beta- hCG represent the characteristic tumor markers of malignant epithelial liver tumors and malignant germ cell tumors (GCT) of apparent yolk sac origin. Among nonreproductive tumors, hepatobiliary tumors (hepatoblastomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and cholangiocarcinoma\u2019s) and neuroendocrine tumors (eg, islet cell tumors and carcinoids) are those most commonly associated with hCG production. Epithelial cell tumor: CA125 Release or secretion of CA125 appears directly linked to the epithelial growth factor receptor signal transduction pathway. It is expressed as a membrane-bound protein at the surface of cells that undergo metaplastic differentiation into a M\u00fcllerian-type epithelium, or released in soluble form in bodily fluids. Up to 80% of women with ovarian carcinoma of epithelial origin (including fallopian tube and primary serous peritoneal carcinoma ) have elevated serum CA 125 levels, with the frequency of elevation correlating with the clinically detected stage. The degree of elevation has also been shown to correlate with tumor burden and FIGO pathologic stage. The reference range of CA 125 is 0-35 units/mL (0-35 kU/L).</p>\n<p></p>",

Metacentric Chromosomes Metacentric chromosomes have the centromere in the center, such that both sections are of equal length. Human chromosome 1 and 3 are metacentric. Submetacentric Chromosomes Submetacentric chromosomes have the centromere slightly offset from the center leading to a slight asymmetry in the length of the two sections. Human chromosomes 4 through 12 are submetacentric. Acrocentric Chromosomes Acrocentric chromosomes have a centromere which is severely offset from the center leading to one very long and one very short section. Human chromosomes 13,15, 21, and 22 are acrocentric. Telocentric Chromosomes Telocentric chromosomes have the centromere at the very end of the chromosome.
