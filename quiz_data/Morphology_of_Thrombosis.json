Superficial venous thrombi typically occur in the saphenous veins in the setting of varicosities . Such thrombi can cause local congestion, swelling, pain, and tenderness, but rarely embolize, but predispose the overlying skin to develop infection and ulcers (varicose ulcers) . Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) involving one of the large leg veins\u2014 at or above the knee (e.g., the popliteal, femoral, and iliac veins) \u2014is more serious because such thrombi more often embolise to the lungs and give rise to pulmonary infarction . DVTs are asymptomatic in approximately 50% of affected individuals and are recognised only in retrospect after embolisation . Common predisposing factors include: Bed rest and immobilisation Trauma Recent surgery (joint replacement especially) Trauma Obesity Malignancy Smoking OCP use Pregnancy and postpartum</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
