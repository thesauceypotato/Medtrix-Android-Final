Irreversible, long-acting \u03b1-blockers such as phenoxybenzamine are started 1 to 3 weeks preoperatively at doses of 10 mg twice daily \u03b2-Blockers such as propranolol are often added preoperatively in patients who have persistent tachycardia and arrhythmias . \u03b2-Blockers should only be instituted after adequate \u03b1-blockade to avoid the effects of unopposed \u03b1 stimulation. Patients also should be volume repleted preoperatively to avoid postoperative hypotension, which ensues with the loss of vasoconstriction after tumor removal. Adrenalectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with pheochromocytoma. Most pheochromocytomas < 6cm in diameter can be safely resected laparoscopically. The open anterior approach is only used: For the detection of bilateral tumors, For operating extra-adrenal lesions, or In metastatic lesions</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Medical Management of Pheochromocytomas: Alpha and beta blockers used to control hypertension and prevent hypertensive crisis during surgery. Alpha blockers used first to prevent vasoconstriction, followed by beta blockers to prevent tachycardia and arrhythmias.

The best test for diagnosis is the measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines.

MRI has a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 100% for pheochromocytoma. CT scan should be performed without contrast administration to prevent the hypertensive crisis. MIBG scan is helpful for extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma , but MRI is still the preferred imaging modality for extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For All Statements:- Statement 1. Measurements of 24-hour urine levels of metanephrine and normetanephrine level are still the most reliable tests available today. Statement 2 . Plasma-free metanephrines testing carries an extremely high sensitivity, approaching 99%, and being a one-time blood test, it is more convenient than 24-hour urine testing. Statement 3. MRI scans are 95% sensitive and almost 100% specific for pheochromocytomas because these tumors have a characteristic appearance on T2-weighted images or after gadolinium. MRI is also the study of choice in pregnant women as there is no risk of radiation exposure. Statement Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is taken up and concentrated by vesicles in the adrenal medullar cells because its structure is similar to norepinephrine. Normal adrenal medullary tissue does not take up appreciable MIBG. 131I-radiolabeled MIBG is, therefore, useful for localizing pheochromocytomas in ectopic positions.</p>\n<p></p>",

Laparoscopic Transperitoneal approach is more popular as it offers a better view of the adrenal region than open surgery. Statement 3.

Open adrenalectomy provides a direct view of the surgical site, allows for more precise dissection, and can remove lymph nodes for cancer staging.
