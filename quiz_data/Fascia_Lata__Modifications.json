      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Gluteus minimus Gluteus minimus lies deep to gluteus medius. Both gluteus medius and gluteus minimus are supplied by superior gluteal nerves. The fan-shaped muscle arises from the outer surface of the ilium between the anterior and inferior gluteal lines and, behind, from the margin of the greater sciatic notch. The fibers converge below to the deep surface of an aponeurosis that ends in a tendon attached to an anterolateral ridge on the greater trochanter and contributes an expansion to the capsule of the hip joint.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A : Tensor fasciae Latae Option B : Gluteus maximus Option D : Few fibers of vastus lateralis</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>The iliotibial band is the thickened band of fascia lata. It receives insertion of the following muscles: The iliotibial tract or iliotibial band (also known as Maissiat's band) is a longitudinal fibrous reinforcement of the fascia lata. The action of muscles associated with the ITB (tensor fasciae latae and some fibers of gluteus maximus) flex, extend, abduct, and laterally and medially rotate the hip. The ITB contributes to lateral knee stabilization. At its distal aspect, the iliotibial tract lies superficially to the vastus lateralis head of the quadriceps femoris, where some of the vastus lateralis fibers may blend with the tract . Its insertion at Gerdy's tubercle is anterior to that of the bicep femoris insertion into the head of the fibula.</p>\n<p></p>",

The superficial lamina is attached to the tubercle of the iliac crest and the deep lamina to the capsule of the hip joint.

The lateral septum, thicker and stronger than the medial one, extends from the attachment of the gluteus maximus to the lateral femoral condyle Saphenous opening: The saphenous opening is an aperture in the deep fascia, inferolateral to the medial end of the inguinal ligament, which allows passage for the long saphenous vein and other smaller vessels</p>\n<p></p>",
