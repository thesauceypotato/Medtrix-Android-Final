Even myocardial infarction occurred in a few cases The withdrawal syndrome is due to upregulation or super sensitivity of \u03b2 adrenoceptor. Following abrupt withdrawal, the normal concentrations of circulating catecholamines Have access to an increased population of beta-adrenoceptors due to the up-regulation of Receptors that lead to withdrawal symptoms.

Rosuvastatin (t=19 hours) and atorvastatin (t=14 hours) are long-acting drugs, therefore can be administered at any time of the day. In addition to lipid-lowering effects, statins also possess additional antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative properties. These are known as pleiotropic effects of statins and are responsible, in part for lowering the risk of stroke and MI. Pravastatin also causes a decrease in plasma fibrinogen levels. Option: D. Metformin and phenformin are biguanides and are preferred agents for obese patients (as these are weight neutral and may even cause weight loss).

Alpha 1 agonist & beta 2 agonist Alpha-adrenergic agonists are a class of sympathomimetic agents that selectively stimulates alpha adrenergic receptors. The alpha-adrenergic receptor has two subclasses \u03b11 and \u03b12. Alpha 2 receptors are associated with sympatholytic properties. B. M2 AND M3 AGONIST We conclude that M (2) and M (3) receptor expression within the same cell undergoes differential agonist-induced regulation being accompanied by distinct regulation of G-protein expression leading to differential effects on signal transduction by other receptor systems. C.Alpha 1 agonist & beta 1 agonist The adrenergic receptors or adrenoceptors are a class of G protein-coupled receptors that are targets of many catecholamines like norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline) produced by the body, but also many medications like beta blockers, beta-2 (\u03b2 2 ) agonists and alpha-2 (\u03b1 2 ) agonists, which are used to treat high blood pressure and asthma, for example. Many cells have these receptors, and the binding of a catecholamine to the receptor will generally stimulate the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The SNS is responsible for the fight-or-flight response, which is triggered by experiences such as exercise or fear-causing situations</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Beta-1 receptor actions Organ/Tissue Action Result Heart (\u1e9e1) (Usual rule is \u1e9e is\n  depressant, but heart is an exception) Cardiac stimulation \u2191 force, \u2191rate, \u2191cardiac output, \u219102 consumption, \u2191 BP Kidneys (B1) (Juxta glomerular\n  cells) Stimulation Renin Secretion Beta-2 receptor actions Organ Action Result Bronchus Relaxation Bronchodilation Uterus Relaxation Uterus relaxes Skeletal muscle BVs Relaxation Vasodilation \u2192\n  Increased blood flow Liver Glycogenolysis Increased blood\n  glucose</p>\n<p></p>",
