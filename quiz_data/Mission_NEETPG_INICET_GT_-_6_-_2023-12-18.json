Airway obstruction or increased airway resistance</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation for each option:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.  Kinked endotracheal tube . A kinked endotracheal tube can lead to significant resistance in the airway, but it typically results in a complete blockage of the airway, causing a sudden and complete loss of CO2 waveform. The gradual upslope observed in this case is not consistent with a kinked tube.</li><li>\u2022 Option A.  Kinked endotracheal tube</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Hyperventilation . Hyperventilation typically leads to a decrease in ETCO2 values, but it doesn't cause a gradual upslope during the expiratory phase. Instead, it results in a faster exhalation of CO2 and a steeper downslope of the waveform.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Hyperventilation</li><li>\u2022 Option C.  Airway obstruction or increased airway resistance . This is the most likely explanation for the observed changes in the capnography waveform. Increased airway resistance or partial airway obstruction can cause a gradual upslope during the expiratory phase as the exhalation of CO2 is slowed down or impeded. This is often seen as a characteristic waveform change in conditions like bronchospasm or when there is a partial obstruction in the airway.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.  Airway obstruction or increased airway resistance</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Equipment malfunction in the CO2 monitoring system . While equipment malfunction is a possibility, it's less likely in this case because the gradual upslope and decreased ETCO2 values are indicative of a physiological change in the patient's airway, such as increased resistance or partial obstruction. Equipment malfunction would typically result in an erratic or non-interpretable waveform rather than the specific changes described.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

For instance, a low-cardiac-output state generates a low end-tidal CO 2 because there is simply not enough flow across the pulmonary circulation.

Clomiphene citrate is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that blocks the negative feedback of estrogen on the hypothalamus, leading to increased production and release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This promotes follicular growth and ovulation.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Clomiphene citrate</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor that reduces the conversion of androgens to estrogen, leading to decreased estrogen levels and increased FSH production. It has been found to be equally effective or even superior to clomiphene citrate in some cases, particularly in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Letrozole</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are not typically used for primary ovulation induction.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. A. Fasciotomy</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation for each option:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Fasciotomy. In cases of tibia fractures associated with swelling, a compromised vascular supply, and elevated compartment pressure, there is a risk of compartment syndrome. Compartment syndrome occurs when increased pressure within a closed anatomical compartment (such as the leg) impairs blood flow, potentially leading to tissue ischemia and necrosis. A feeble but palpable pulse is an indication that blood flow is compromised. The definitive treatment for compartment syndrome is fasciotomy, which involves making a surgical incision to relieve pressure within the affected compartment, thereby restoring blood flow and preventing tissue damage.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Fasciotomy.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. External fixation. External fixation may be considered in certain cases, but it does not address the issue of compartment syndrome directly. It is typically used to stabilize the fracture temporarily and may not relieve the pressure within the compartment.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. External fixation.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Interlock nail. Intramedullary nailing (interlock nail) is a surgical technique used to stabilize the fractured bone but does not directly address compartment syndrome or elevated compartment pressures.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Interlock nail.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Lower limb venography. Lower limb venography is not the primary diagnostic or therapeutic option for compartment syndrome. It is used to evaluate the venous system and is not indicated in the acute management of a tibia fracture with signs of compartment syndrome.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Lower limb venography.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
