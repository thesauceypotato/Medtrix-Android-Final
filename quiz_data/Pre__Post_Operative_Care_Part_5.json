An estimate of the patient\u2019s peak oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) can be calculated from their point score. Although it correlates with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), some patients who score poorly on DASI go on to score well on CPET CPET (CardioPulmonary Exercise Testing) CPET is the gold standard measurement of a patient\u2019s fitness. The oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) of the patient are measured while they undergo a 10\u00adminute period of incrementally demanding exercise (usually on a cycle ergometer) up to their maximally tolerated level Principle : When a subject\u2019s delivery of O2 to active tissues becomes inadequate, anaerobic metabolism begins; lactate is buffered by bicarbonate and the resulting CO2 increases out of proportion to the escalation in physical difficulty and O2 consumption The \u2018anaerobic threshold\u2019 (AT) is the VO2 in mL/kg/min at which this occurs. Peak oxygen consumption is also measured. This is the end product of a subject\u2019s combined fitness Subjects with either an AT below 11 mL/kg/min or a VO2 peak below 15 mL/kg/min are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality after major surgery</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All of the above The three most common objective measures of surgical risk in cirrhotic patients are the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score, the MELD score, and residual liver volume</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>CTP Scoring System A CTP score of 5 to 6 is considered class A (well-compensated), 7 to 9 is considered class B (significant compromise), and 10 to 15 is considered class C (decompensated). While outcomes vary by type of procedure, broad estimates of mortality for abdominal operations are 10%, 20%, and 60% for CTP A, B, and C, respectively MELD SCORE : The MELD score is predictive of survival in patients with cirrhosis and was originally developed primarily for transplant selection. In recent years, the MELD score has gradually supplanted the CTP classification for both liver-directed operations and nonhepatic surgical risk stratification CTP & MELD Unlike the CTP score, which includes subjective components such as encephalopathy and ascites, the MELD score is comprised only of objective measures: total bilirubin (mg/dL), creatinine (mg/dL), and international normalized ratio (INR, %). While some studies suggested that a MELD score of 10 to 14 was a better predictor of death or need for transplantation after abdominal surgery than CTP class C, CTP score and ASA classification were predictive of mortality among patients selected for nonhepatic abdominal operations and MELD was not. Overall, the predictive utility of both MELD and CTP scores may be greater for urgent than for elective operations For all patients with cirrhosis, the operative risk increases with higher CPT (B\u2013C) and higher MELD (>18\u201320)</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>MELD Score = 9.57 Ln(SCr) + 3.78 Ln(Tbil) + 11.2 Ln(INR) + 6.43 where Ln represents natural logarithm, SCr is serum creatinine level (in milligrams per deciliter), and Tbil is serum bilirubin level (in milligrams per deciliter)</p>\n<p></p>",
