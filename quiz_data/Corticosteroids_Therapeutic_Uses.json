Such patients may need protection with a corticosteroid (oral or i.v.) if a stressful situation develops up to one year after withdrawal. Administration of ACTH during withdrawal does not hasten recovery because it has been found that adrenals recover earlier than the pituitary and hypothalamus If a patient on corticosteroid therapy develops an infection -the steroid should not be discontinued despite its propensity to weaken host defense and delay healing. Rather, the dose may have to be increased to meet the stress of infection. Surgery in such a patient should be covered by intraoperative and postoperative i.v. hydrocortisone till the condition stabilizes, followed by oral prednisolone. Measures that minimize HPA axis suppression are: Use shorter-acting steroids (hydrocortisone, prednisolone) at the lowest possible dose. Use steroids for the shortest period possible. Give the entire daily dose at one time in the morning. Switch to alternate-day therapy if the condition does not deteriorate on the \u2018off\u2019 day. It has been found that a moderate dose of a short-acting steroid (e.g. prednisolone) given at 48 hr intervals did not cause HPA suppression, whereas the same total amount given in 4 divided 12 hourly doses produced marked HPA suppression. Alternate-day therapy also resulted in less immunological suppression -lower risk of infection. The longer-acting steroids (dexamethasone , etc.) are not suitable for alternate-day therapy. The only problem with alternate-day therapy is that many steroid-dependent patients are incapacitated on the \u2018off day\u2019.
