B) Intestine</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 RNA editing of Apo B mRNA occurs specifically in the intestine, where a cytidine deaminase enzyme converts a specific cytidine (C) to uridine (U) in the mRNA. This creates a premature stop codon, resulting in the production of the shorter Apo B-48 protein. This tissue-specific editing does not occur in the liver, where the unedited mRNA produces full-length Apo B-100.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Liver: In the liver, no RNA editing occurs, allowing the full translation of the mRNA to produce Apo B-100. The editing machinery is not active in hepatic tissue.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Liver:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Both liver and intestine: RNA editing of Apo B mRNA is tissue-specific and occurs only in the intestine, not in both organs. If editing occurred in both tissues, Apo B-100 would not be produced.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Both liver and intestine:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Neither liver nor intestine: This is incorrect as RNA editing definitely occurs in intestinal cells, where the specific cytidine deaminase is expressed and active.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

In this case, intestine-specific RNA editing creates Apo B-48, while the absence of editing in the liver allows production of full-length Apo B-100</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
