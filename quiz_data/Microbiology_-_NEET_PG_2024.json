Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a gram positive cocci which is non hemolytic, catalase positive and coagulase/DNase negative and Novobiocin resistant.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Symptomatic UTI need to be treated with even lower bacterial counts. A count of 10 5 CFU/ml is required for asymptomatic bacteriuria. The Staphylococci are Gram-positive cocci that form clusters, pairs and, rarely, short chains. The catalase test (with 3% hydrogen peroxide) differentiates Streptococci (catalase-negative) from Staphylococci (catalase-positive). The ability to clot blood plasma (slide and tube coagulase tests) separates Staphylococci into two groups: the coagulase-positive Staphylococci, which constitutes the most pathogenic species Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), which constitutes S. epidermidis, S. Saprophyticus, S. hemolyticus, and 30+ other species. The coagulase-negative staphylococci exist as part of the normal flora on the skin and in the throat and nose, and only some species can cause infections. saprophyticus is a common cause of urinary tract infection; it is responsible for almost half of all UTIs in sexually active young women. S. saprophyticus is resistant to novobiocin. When catalase-positive, coagulase-negative gram-positive cocci in clusters are isolated from urine specimens of the above group of patients, the laboratory performs a novobiocin test to distinguish this organism from other similar pathogens.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. The patient is symptomatic for UTI so it cannot be asymptomatic bacteriuria. Option: B. The isolation of pure colonies of Gram-positive cocci in symptomatic patient which is novobiocin resistant is suggestive of S saprophyticus infection so no need to repeat sampling. Option: D. S saprophyticus  is an important cause of UTI in sexually active young females.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Multiplex PCR Advanced microbiology technologies such as multiplex molecular assays (i.e. syndromic diagnostic tests) are a novel approach to the rapid diagnosis of common infectious diseases including meningitis. Multiplex PCR and multiplex real-time PCR can be used for simultaneous detection of common agents of A meningitis/encephalitis (ME) panel is able to detect the most common bacterial, viral and fungal causes of community-acquired CNS infections concurrently with a single CSF sample.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Molecular tests are highly sensitive, detect even few bacteria in CSF with less turnaround time than culture and also help in serogroup identification. Multiplex PCR (mPCR) tests (also known as \u2018syndromic\u2019 panels) combine tests for numerous pathogens and resistance genes into a single test i.e. Biofire FilmArray. These syndromic panels have the ability to impact infection control, antimicrobial stewardship, and patient outcomes by significantly reducing time to diagnosis and clinical decision making. BioFire FilmArray: An automated nested multiplex PCR system where all the steps from sample preparation to amplification, detection and analysis are performed automatically by the system, which can simultaneously detect common agents of meningitis (both pyogenic and viral) in CSF, with a turnaround time of 1 hour. Four panels are available such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, meningitis-encephalitis and blood culture identification panels; each panel comprises of primers targeting 20\u201325 common pathogens infecting the respective systems Except for the blood panel which detects pathogens from positively flagged blood culture bottles, the other panels detect pathogen(s) directly from the specimen. It has excellent sensitivity and specificity with a turnaround time of 1 hour. However, the higher cost of the panels limits its wide use, so need to be used judiciously, only for those samples with findings indicative of infectious meningitis (e.g. positive Gram stain, leucocytes, or cases where clinicians maintained a high suspicion of infection).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Real time PCR is based on PCR technology, which is used to amplify and simultaneously detect or quantify a targeted DNA molecule on a real-time basis. Reverse transcriptase real-time PCR formats can detect and quantify RNA molecules of the test organism in the sample on a real-time basis. It uses a different thermocycler than the conventional PCR. It is very expensive. Option: B. Nested PCR is modification of PCR, where two rounds of PCR amplification are carried out by using two primers that are targeted against two different DNA sequences of the same organism. The amplified products of the first round PCR are subjected to another round of amplification using a second primer which targets the same organism but a different DNA sequence. It is more sensitive as a double round of amplification yields a high quantity of DNA More specific: Use of two primers targeting two regions of DNA of the same organisms makes the test more specific. Option: C. Conventional PCR amplifies only the DNA. For amplifying RNA, RT PCR is done After RNA extraction, the first step is addition of a reverse transcriptase enzyme that converts RNA into DNA. Then, the amplification of DNA and gel documentation steps are similar to conventional PCR. It is extremely useful for detection of RNA viruses or 16S rRNA genes of the organisms.</p>\n<p></p>",

Paratyphi A,B and C (paratyphoid fever). Pathogenesis: Salmonellae are transmitted by oral route, through ingestion of contaminated food or water. Infective dose of Salmonella is higher than that of Shigella. Minimum 10 3 \u201310 6 bacilli are needed to initiate the infection. Entry through epithelial cells (M cells) lining the intestinal mucosa \u2014 Salmonellae can trigger the formation of membrane ruffles on the cell membrane of M cells. These ruffles reach out and enclose the adherent bacteria within the large vesicles. This process of uptake is called bacteria-mediated endocytosis (BME); which is mediated by a specialized type III secretion system. Following entry, the bacilli remain inside the vacuoles in the cytoplasm. Entry into macrophages: Salmonellae containing vacuoles cross the epithelial layer to reach submucosa, where they are phagocytosed by the macrophages where they survive leading to bacteremia. Clinical manifestations: Fever (step ladder pattern of remittent fever) Other symptoms: Headache, chills, cough, sweating, myalgia and arthralgia. Rashes (called rose spots): Faint, salmon-colored, blanching, maculopapular rash on the trunk and chest seen in 30% of patients at the end of the first week. Early intestinal manifestations such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and anorexia. Important signs include hepatosplenomegaly, epistaxis and relative bradycardia. Complications: Gastrointestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation can occur mostly in the third and fourth weeks of illness Neurologic manifestations occur rarely which include meningitis, cerebellar ataxia and neuropsychiatric symptoms Lab diagnosis: Culture isolation Blood and bone marrow culture (in first week of illness): Conventional/Automated blood culture systems Stool culture (in 3\u20134 weeks of illness): Enrichment broth such as Selenite F broth, tetrathionate broth and gram-negative broth Low selective medium: MacConkey agar (translucent NLF colonies) Highly selective media: DCA, XLD agar and Wilson Blair\u2019s Bismuth sulphite medium.

A number of virulence factors (e.g. P fimbriae, mannose resistant fimbriae in E. coli) help in adhesion. Fimbriae are organs of adhesion that help in bacterial adhesion. They help in bacterial adhesion to epithelial surface helping in colonization. They are very small, measuring 0.5 \u00b5m long and 10 nm in thickness. A single bacterium can have as many as 1,000 fimbriae. They are present in gram-negative and some gram positive bacteria. Pili are made up of a protein called pilin. They are antigenic; however, the antibodies against pilin antigens are not protective. They are not related to motility and can be found both in motile as well as in nonmotile organisms. A special type of pilus (called sex pilus) also exists which helps in bacterial conjugation by forming a conjugation tube through which the bacterial gene transfer takes place. Most of the urinary tract infections that involve the bladder or kidney in an otherwise healthy host are caused by a small number of O antigen types that have specifically elaborated virulence factors that facilitate colonization and subsequent clinical infections. These organisms are designated as uropathogenic E. coli. Typically, these organisms produce hemolysin, which is cytotoxic and facilitates tissue invasion.

A biofilm is a well-organized community of bacteria that adheres to surfaces and is embedded in an extracellular slime layer. Once a bacterium attaches to a surface, it activates a whole different set of genes that gives the bacterium different characteristics from those that it had as a free-floating organism.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Biofilm appears to act as a barrier, protecting bacteria from host defense mechanisms as well as from antibiotics. Bacteria i.e. S. epidermidis produce the extracellular polysaccharide material (glycocalyx or slime) that facilitates formation of a protective biofilm on the device surfaces. Similarly, mucoid strains of Pseudomonas have a slime layer or alginate layer which facilitates biofilm formation, thus helps in adhesion to host cells and purulent mucus. Such strains can cause infections in patients with cystic fibrosis</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A.

Biofilm is a group of bacterial cells which stick to each other on a surface and are embedded within a layer (called slime layer) of a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substance called glycocalyx. Apart from adhesion, biofilms also help them to escape immune mediated killing. Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP): The organism begins to form biofilm both inside and outside the endotracheal tube within a day of placement, which acts as a reservoir of infection, preventing the entry of antimicrobials and the host immune system.</p>\n<p></p>",

The arrangement of flagella is unique to the species observed. A bacterial flagellum is made up of several protofilaments, each made up of thousands of molecules of a protein subunit called flagellin. The flagellins of different bacterial species presumably differ from one another in primary structure. They are highly antigenic (H antigens), and some of the immune responses to infection are directed against these proteins. The flagellum is attached to the bacterial cell body by a complex structure consisting of a hook and a basal body. The hook is a short curved structure that appears to act as the universal joint between the motor in the basal structure and the flagellum. The basal body bears a set of rings, one pair in Gram-positive bacteria and two pairs in Gram-negative bacteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A, B & D.

In severe cases of dengue, hematocrit levels should be monitored every 3-4 hours,</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Dengue virus (DENV) - most common arbovirus found in India. Belongs to family Flaviviridae. Enveloped virus, containing ssRNA. Has four serotypes (DEN-1 to DEN-4) & recently, the fifth serotype (DEN-5) was discovered (2013- Bangkok) Aedes aegypti is the principal vector followed by Aedes albopictus . They bite during the day time. aegypti - nervous feeder (so, it bites repeatedly to more than one person to complete a blood meal) and resides in domestic places - most efficient vector. Aedes albopictus - found in peripheral urban areas - aggressive and concordant feeder; hence is less efficient in transmission. Aedes becomes infective only when it feeds on viremic patients Extrinsic incubation period - 8\u201310 days (needed before it become infective) and once infected, it remains infective for life Transmission cycle : Man and Aedes - principal reservoirs. Transmission cycle of four serotypes do not involve other animals. Fifth serotype follows the sylvatic cycle. PATHOGENESIS: Primary dengue infection - infected for the first time with any one serotype. Months to years later, a more severe form of dengue illness may appear (called secondary dengue infection ) due to infection with another second serotype which is different from the first serotype causing primary infection. Antibody response: Neutralizing antibodies : Protective in nature. Such antibodies are produced against the infective serotype (which last lifelong ) as well as against other serotypes (which last for some time). Non-neutralizing antibodies Last lifelong and are heterotypic in nature - they are produced against other serotypes but not against the infective serotype. Such antibodies produced following the first serotype infection - bind to a second serotype during secondary dengue infection - but instead of neutralizing the second serotype, it protects it from host immune system by inhibiting the bystander B-cell activation against the second serotype. Above phenomena is called antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) . Non-neutralizing antibodies promote recruitment of mononuclear cells followed by release of cytokines. Among all the serotypes combinations, ADE - remarkably observed when serotype 1 infection is followed by serotype 2, which also claims to be the most severe form of dengue infection. Denue classification based on severity (WHO- 2009) Clinical features: IP: 3\u201314 days Febrile phase: Sudden onset high grade fever with headache, retrobulbar pain, photophobia accompanied by facial flushing, skin erythema and pain in the back & limbs (break-bone fever), lymphadenopathy and maculopapular rash. The fever is typically biphasic (saddleback). This phase usually lasts 2-7 days. Critical phase: Patients become worse around time of defervescence. usually on 3-8 days of illness. Progressive leukopenia followed by a rapid decrease in platelet count usually precedes plasma leakage. An increasing hematocrit above the baseline may be one of the earliest sign. Factors determining outcome: Infecting serotype: Type 2 - more dangerous than other serotypes Sequence of infection: Serotype 1 followed by serotype 2 Age: Though all age groups are affected equally, children less than 12 years are more prone to develop DHF and DSS. Lab diagnosis: NS1 Antigen Detection ELISA and ICT formats are available for detecting NS1 antigen in serum. NS1 antigen becomes detectable from day 1 of fever Antibody Detection In primary infection: IgM appears first after 5 days of fever and disappears within 90 days. IgG is detectable at low titer in 14\u201321 days of illness, and then it slowly increases In secondary infection: IgG antibody titers rise rapidly. IgG is often cross reactive with many flaviviruses and may give false positive result after recent infection or vaccination with yellow fever virus or JE . MAC-ELISA (IgM antibody capture ELISA) Neutralization tests such as plaque reduction test, and microneutralization tests are available. Virus Isolation - mosquito cell line (such as C6/36 and AP61) Molecular Method Detection of specific genes of viral RNA (3\u2019-UTR region) by real time RT-PCR Genotype detection Treatment: No specific antiviral therapy . Treatment is symptomatic and supportive such as: Replacement of plasma losses Correction of electrolyte and metabolic disturbances Platelet transfusion if needed. Dengue vaccine: CYD-TDV Licensed for human use since 2015. Chimeric Yellow Fever-Dengue, Live-Attenuated, Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine (CYD-TDV); commercially available as dengvaxia (developed by Sanofi Pasteur) Uses live attenuated yellow fever 17D virus as vaccine vector. Age: Indicated for 9\u201345 years of age Schedule: 3 injections of 0.5 mL administered subcutaneously at 6 month intervals WHO also recommends Dengvaxia - used only in people previously infected with dengue.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B, D.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Candida The given clinical vignette is suggestive of central line associated bloodstream infection by Candida sp. which is seen as gram positive budding yeast cells in microscopy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Candidiasis Lab Diagnosis: Specimens and microscopic examination: Tissue biopsies, centrifuged spinal fluid, and other specimens may be examined in Gram-stained smears or histopathological slides for pseudo hyphae and budding cells. Skin or nail scrapings are first placed in a drop of KOH and calcofluor-white. Culture: All suspected specimens are cultured on fungal or suitable bacteriologic media at room temperature or at 37\u00b0C. Budding yeast cells and the presence of pseudo hyphae can be seen. Candida albicans is identified by the production of germ tubes or chlamydospores. Other yeast isolates are speciated phenotypically by using any of several commercial kits to test for the metabolic assimilation of a battery of organic substrates. CHROMagar is a useful commercial medium for the rapid identification of several Candida species based on fungal enzymatic action on chromogenic substrates in the medium. After incubation for 1\u20134 days on CHROMagar, colonies of C. albicans are green, C. tropicalis is blue, C. glabrata is dark purple, and C. parapsilosis, C. lusitaniae, C. guilliermondii, and C. krusei acquire a pinkish hue. Molecular methods: In many clinical laboratories, blood cultures for Candida are augmented by real-time PCR with species-specific primers, which are commonly designed from sequences of the multicopy ribosomal DNA genes. The specificity of DNA tests for candidemia is excellent, but the sensitivity can be compromised by a low census of yeast cells in the blood sample. Yeast cultures, especially non-C. albicans species often take several days for definitive identification. With its ease of sample preparation and automation, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), has become a popular rapid method of identifying species of Candida, as well as other pathogenic fungi and bacteria. Serology: Serum antibodies and cell-mediated immunity are demonstrable in most people as a result of lifelong exposure to Candida. In systemic candidiasis, antibody titers to various candidal antigens may be elevated, but there are no clear criteria for establishing a diagnosis serologically. The detection of circulating Candida cell wall mannan, using a latex agglutination test or an enzyme immunoassay, is much more specific, but the test lacks high sensitivity because many patients are only transiently positive or because they do not develop significant and detectable antigen titers until late in the disease. Nevertheless, a positive test can be most helpful. The biochemical test for circulating (1,3)-\u03b2-D-glucan, is widely used to screen for fungemia in patients at risk who often have negative blood cultures.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A & B. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus are gram positive cocci in gram stain. Option D: Aspergillus spp. is a mold, which shows hyaline septate hyphae and dichotomous branching in microscopy.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The interpretation of positive cultures varies with the specimen. Any positive culture from normally sterile body sites is significant. Positive blood cultures may reflect systemic candidiasis or transient candidemia due to a contaminated intravenous line. The diagnostic value of a quantitative urine culture depends on the integrity of the specimen and the yeast census. Contaminated Foley catheters may lead to \u201cfalse-positive\u201d urine cultures. Sputum cultures have no value because Candida species are part of the oral microbiota. Cultures of skin lesions are confirmatory and distinguish cutaneous candidiasis from dermatophytosis or another infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA albicans is yeast like fungus showing pseudo hyphae Cryptococcus is the only true yeast which is pathogenic Dimorphic Fungi (Thermal Dimorphism) are mycelial forms at 25\u00b0C and yeast forms at 37\u00b0C, e.g. Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum etc.</p>\n<p></p>",
