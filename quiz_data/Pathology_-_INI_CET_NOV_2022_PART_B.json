TH1 cells secrete IFN-\u03b3 and promote classical macrophage activation. TH2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which attract and activate eosinophils and induce alternative macrophage activation Cytokines produced IFN-Y IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 IL-17, IL-22 Cytokines that induce this subset IFN- \u03b3 , IL-12 IL-4 TGF-B, IL-6, IL-1, IL-23 Immunological reactions triggered Macrophage activation Stimulation of IgE production, activation of mast cells and eosinophils Recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes Host defense against Intracellular microbes Helminthic Extracellular bacteria, fungi Role in disease Immune-mediated chronic inflammatory diseases (often autoimmune) Allergies Immune-mediated chronic inflammatory diseases (often autoimmune) IL-4 functions to promote class switching to IgE in B cells and to stimulate the proliferation of TH2 cells. IL-5 is important in the development and activation of eosinophils , which play a crucial role in type I hypersensitivity reactions. IL-13 stimulates IgE production and induces mucus secretion in epithelial cells. TH2 cells and other cells, such as mast cells , produce chemokines that attract other TH2 cells and leukocytes to the site of the reaction. IL-13 can also induce differentiation in dendritic cells and shares functional similarities with IL-4 IL-9 Main function is promote mast cell growth and function</p>\n<p></p>",

E-cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule, and its loss or dysfunction is a characteristic feature of diffuse-type gastric carcinoma, also known as signet ring cell carcinoma. The loss of E-cadherin contributes to the invasive and diffusely infiltrative growth pattern seen in this type of gastric cancer.

The Wnt signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development of the intestinal-type of gastric cancer. Depth of invasion has no prognostic value: This statement is incorrect.

The histology shows folded nuclei and immunohistochemistry shows positive S100 and CD1a. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is an idiopathic condition characterised by proliferation of abnormal Langerhans (antigen-presenting) cells. The disease has characteristics of both an abnormal reactive process and a neoplastic process. It may present initially as a rash. It can be disseminated and involve the bone marrow, lungs, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and pituitary gland. Prognosis varies depending on presentation and organ involvement. LCH can occur at any age but is most common from birth to age 15 years Langerhans cells are dendritic antigen-presenting cells. The abnormal cells in LCH have abnormal proliferation and lower antigen-presenting capability. LCH lesions also contain inflammatory cells and cytokines such as T lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages.</p>\n<p></p>",

Hereditary spherocytosis is a hereditary hemolytic anaemia mostly inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is characterised by mutation of spectrin and ankyrin, RBC surface proteins, which cause disruption of membranes and hemolysis. The disease presents at a young age with severe jaundice and fatigue. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia causes gallstones in early adulthood. Peripheral smear shows spherical RBCs without central pallor. MCHC is increased in spherocytosis, whereas MCH is slightly lower due to the anaemia. Splenectomy is the specific treatment. It prevents hemolysis, anaemia and other complications such as gallstones.</p>\n<p></p>",
