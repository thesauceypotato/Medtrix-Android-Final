The activation energy barrier separating wild-type PrPC from PrPSc could be crossed on rare occasions when viewed in the context of a population. Most individuals would be spared, but presentations in older people, with an incidence of 1 per million, would be seen. PrPSc may be present at low levels in some normal cells , where it performs an important, but as yet unknown, function. The level of PrPSc in such cells is hypothesized to be sufficiently low as not to be detected by routine bioassay. In some altered metabolic states , the cellular mechanisms for clearing PrPSc might become compromised , and the rate of PrPSc formation would then begin to exceed the capacity of the cell to clear it. It suggests that PrPSc is not simply a misfolded protein , as proposed for the first and second mechanisms, but that it is an alternatively folded molecule with a function . Moreover, the multitude of conformational states that PrPSc can adopt, as described above, raises the possibility that PrPSc or another protein might function in a process such as short-term memory, where information storage is thought to occur in the absence of new protein synthesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options A , C, and D are incorrect.</p>\n<p></p>",

Several different scenarios might explain the initiation of sporadic prion disease A somatic mutation -the mutant PrPSc must be capable of targeting wild-type PrPC, a process known to be possible for some mutations but less likely for others. The activation energy barrier separating wild-type PrPC from PrPSc could be crossed on rare occasions when viewed in the context of a population. Most individuals would be spared, but presentations in older persons, with an incidence of 1 per million, would be seen. PrPSc may be present at low levels in some normal cells , where it performs an important, but as yet unknown, function. The level of PrPSc in such cells is hypothesized to be sufficiently low as not to be detected by routine bioassay. In some altered metabolic states , the cellular mechanisms for clearing PrPSc might become compromised , and the rate of PrPSc formation would then begin to exceed the capacity of the cell to clear it. It suggests that PrPSc is not simply a misfolded protein , as proposed for the first and second mechanisms, but that it is an alternatively folded molecule with a function . Moreover, the multitude of conformational states that PrPSc can adopt, as described above, raises the possibility that PrPSc or another protein might function in a process such as short term memory where information storage is thought to occur in the absence of new protein synthesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B: FamilialCJD - No familial history given.

What is certain is that PrP-prion-tainted meat should be prevented from entering the human food supply. The most compelling evidence that vCJD is caused by BSE prions was obtained from experiments in mice expressing the bovine PrP transgene . Both BSE and vCJD prions were efficiently transmitted to these transgenic mice and with similar incubation periods. In contrast to sCJD prions , vCJD prions did not transmit disease efficiently to mice expressing a chimeric human\u2013mouse PrP transgene. Earlier studies with nontransgenic mice suggested that vCJD and BSE might be derived from the same source because both inocula transmitted disease with similar but very long incubation periods. Attempts to determine the origin of BSE and vCJD prions have relied on passing studies in mice, some of which are described above, as well as studies of the conformation and glycosylation of PrPSc. One scenario suggests that a particular conformation of bovine PrPSc was selected for heat resistance during the rendering process and was then reselected multiple times as cattle infected by ingesting prion-contaminated meat and bone meal (MBM) were slaughtered and their offal rendered into more MBM. Variant CJD cases have virtually disappeared with protection of the beef supply.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A: Sporadic CJD- The precise cause of sporadic CJD is unclear, but it's been suggested that a normal brain protein changes abnormally (\"misfolds\") and turns into a Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between 45 and 75 .
