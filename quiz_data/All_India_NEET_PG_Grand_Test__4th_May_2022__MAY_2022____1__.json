      "explanation": "<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u27a4 Variegate porphyria (VP) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder due to partially deficient activity of the mitochondrial enzyme protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOX) . VP is both a cutaneous porphyria (with chronic blistering skin lesions) and an acute porphyria (with severe episodic neurovisceral symptoms).In adult-onset cutaneous blistering lesions (sub epidermal vesicles, bullae, and erosions that crust over and heal slowly) of sun-exposed skin, especially the hands and face. Facial hyperpigmentation and hypertrichosis may occur. Acute neurovisceral symptoms can occur any time after puberty, are highly variable, but may be similar from episode to episode in a patient with recurrent attacks. Symptoms may become chronic. The most common manifestations are abdominal pain, constipation, tachycardia, hypertension, pain in the back, chest, and extremities, anxiety, agitation, seizures, and neuromuscular weakness that may progress to quadriparesis and respiratory paralysis. The biochemical diagnosis of VP is established in an individual with elevated urine porphobilinogen (PBG) or porphyrins and a fluorescence peak at ~626 nm on plasma fluorescence scanning The molecular diagnosis of VP is established by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PPOX on molecular genetic testing.</li><li>\u27a4 Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP )characteristically demonstrate acute episodes of neurovisceral symptoms but may not manifest fully for a long time. AIP manifests as episodes of abdominal pain, neuropathies, and constipation, but, unlike most other porphyrias, patients with AIP do not develop a cutaneous rash. The primary enzymatic defect in AIP is the deficiency of porphobilinogen - deaminase, also called hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), the third enzyme in heme synthesis. The acute attacks of AIP are a result of the uncontrolled upregulation of the ALA synthase enzyme. The diagnosis of AIP gets delayed due to nonspecific symptoms and similarities with other diseases. The only cure is orthoptic liver transplantation.</li><li>\u27a4 Congenital erythropoietic porphyria is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder by markedly reduced enzyme activity of uroporphyrinogen III synthase, characterized in most individuals by severe cutaneous photosensitivity with blistering and increased friability of the skin over light-exposed areas. Onset in most affected individuals occurs at birth or early infancy. The first manifestation is often pink-to-dark red discoloration of the urine. Repeated light exposure can lead to scarring, infection and loss of facial features and digits.</li><li>\u27a4 Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) is an acute (hepatic) porphyria in which the acute symptoms are neurovisceral and occur in discrete episodes. Attacks typically start in the abdomen with low-grade pain that slowly increases over a period of days (not hours) with nausea progressing to vomiting. In some individuals, the pain is predominantly in the back or extremities. When an acute attack is untreated, a motor neuropathy may develop over a period of days or a few week. Acute hepatic porphyria should be suspected in individuals with the following symptoms or findings are Nausea for at least 48 hours, Abdominal, back, or extremity pain for at least 48 hours, New-onset seizures, Hyponatremia, Family history of porphyria. The most sensitive and specific biochemical screening test for any one of the acute porphyrias (including HCP) during an acute attack is a striking increase in urinary porphobilinogen. Quantitative analysis of porphyrins in both urine and feces is essential to distinguish between the different acute porphyrias and establish the diagnosis of HCP.</li><li>\u27a4 Learning objectives: The porphyria diseases are a group of metabolic disorders caused by abnormal functioning of heme biosynthesis enzymes and characterized by the excessive accumulation and excretion of porphyrins and their precursors. Precisely which of these chemicals builds up depends on the type of porphyria. Porphyria is not a single disease but a group of nine disorders. Each porphyria results from overproduction of heme precursors secondary to partial deficiency or, in XLP, increased activity of one of the enzymes of heme biosynthesis.</li></u\n\n<p style='font-size: 10px; color: #808080; font-style: italic;'></p>",

Some of the diagnoses included are associated with major morbidity and mortality.</li><li>\u21b3 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) This diagnosis should be considered in any patient presenting with chest pain. If you feel the patient's history and physical are concerning for ACS, consider an ECG and troponin level to assist in ruling out ACS. The patient should also be on continuous cardiac monitoring while in the emergency department.</li><li>\u21b3 Pneumothorax Consider the patient population at risk for spontaneous pneumothorax. A chest x-ray and/or point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) can be used to assist in evaluating the possibility of pneumothorax.</li><li>\u21b3 Pneumonia If the patient is complaining of a productive cough and/or fever or is at high risk for pneumonia, consider this on your differential diagnosis. Pneumonia can cause chest pain in addition to the other symptoms we associate with the diagnosis. A chest x-ray, complete blood count (CBC), and a basic metabolic panel (BMP) can be helpful when considering this as a differential diagnosis. Vital signs are also important when considering this diagnosis.</li><li>\u21b3 Aortic Dissection This is a medical and possibly a surgical emergency. Consider a CTA to evaluate for aortic dissection if this is a concern based on the patient's history and physical exam.</li><li>\u21b3 Pulmonary Embolism Ask about pulmonary embolism (PE) risk factors, such as malignancy, recent travel, recent surgery, personal history of PE or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and symptoms, such as shortness of breath. Tachycardia can also be a sign of PE. Consider using a clinical decision rule, such as PERC and Well's criteria when considering PE. A D-dimer and/or CTA can be helpful when evaluating for a PE if this is on your differential diagnosis. There may also be nonspecific ECG and POCUS changes seen.</li><li>\u21b3 Esophageal Perforation The healthcare professional must have a high clinical suspicion for this diagnosis, and it is often due to an iatrogenic cause, such as a recent endoscopy. This patient's pain should be severe and unrelenting, and typically, they present in shock with abnormal vital signs.</li><li>\u21b3 INCORRECT OPTIONS:</li><li>\u21b3 OPTION A Measurement of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) might be indicated in patients with suspected costochondritis if there are accompanying manifestations that suggest an underlying inflammatory or rheumatologic condition (e.g., morning stiffness, arthralgia, myalgias, chest wall swelling), which this patient does not have.</li><li>\u21b3 OPTION B Chest x-ray is indicated in patients with acute chest pain and features that suggest a rib fracture(e.g., history of trauma, localized chest wall tenderness), a pulmonary cause of chest pain(e.g., cough, abnormal respiratory findings on auscultation), or heart failure(e.g., crackles on auscultation, peripheral edema, history of heart failure or other cardiac condition). In this young, otherwise healthy patient with suspected costochondritis, a chest x-ray is not indicated.</li><li>\u21b3 OPTION D Intraarticular injection of lidocaine and/or triamcinolone can be used to treat refractory cases of costochondritis. However, these treatments are not appropriate first-line therapies for this condition.</li><li>\u21b3 OPTION E Consider a CTA to evaluate for aortic dissection if this is a concern based on the patient's history and physical exam but in this case, history is suggestive of Costochondritis</li><li>\u21b3 EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVE Acute-onset chest pain that is reproducible with palpation along the costochondral junction in a young patient who recently began a workout program is highly suggestive of costochondritis. For young patients in whom a diagnosis of costochondritis is highly suspected, supportive care (e.g., rest, ice, and analgesia) without further evaluation is appropriate if cardiopulmonary examination findings are normal and there are no identifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease(CVD).</li></u\n\n<p style='font-size: 10px; color: #808080; font-style: italic;'></p>",

However, this patient presents with low EPO levels, making paraneoplastic syndrome unlikely. Moreover, she lacks other typical features of RCC, including hematuria, flank pain, and a palpable flank mass.</li><li>\u21b3 OPTION B An EPO receptor mutation is a typical finding in individuals with primary familial and congenital polycythemia(PFCP). PFCP is a rare disorder that may manifest with findings similar to those seen in polycythemia vera, including highly elevated RBC mass (\u2191Hb, \u2191Hct), low EPO levels, plethora, fatigue, headache, hypertension, and visual and auditory disturbances. However, a patient with PFCP would typically have a normal-sized spleen, earlier onset of symptoms, and a family history positive for this condition. Moreover, this patient lacks other typical findings of PFCP, such as a normal platelet count, which indicates that other hematopoietic cell lines are not involved (isolated erythrocytosis).</li><li>\u21b3 OPTION C Stress erythrocytosis(Gaisbock syndrome) is a form of secondary erythrocytosis characterized by an increase in RBC mass due to a decrease in plasma volume (relative polycythemia). The condition can manifest with typical findings of polycythemia vera, including a (relative) increase of RBC mass (\u2191Hb, \u2191Hct), hypertension, plethora, neurological symptoms, and visual and auditory disturbances. However, this condition typically occurs in obese middle-aged men receiving diuretic treatment, which is not the case for this patient. Moreover, stress erythrocytosis would not explain this patient's splenomegaly, elevated platelet count, and low EPO levels.</li><li>\u21b3 OPTION E PAX5 mutations occur frequently in adult B-cell progenitoracute lymphoblastic leukemia.</li><li>\u21b3 EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVE A mutation in the Janus kinase 2(JAK2)gene is an important etiological factor in a number of myeloproliferative neoplasms.
