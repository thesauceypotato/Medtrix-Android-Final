In albinism there is lack of tyrosinase enzyme and hence melanin is not formed.

Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease and will have an acquired onset along with lack of melanocytes. Option C. Nevus depigmentosus will have a localised hypopigmented patch and will not be all over the body. Melanocytes are reduced on biopsy and there is reduced melanin transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes. Option D. Piebaldism is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterised by localised white areas and white hair (white forelock) since birth. It is due to mutation of KIT proto-oncogene.In this disorder, there is impaired migration of melanoblasts from the neural crest into the skin.</p>\n<p></p>",
