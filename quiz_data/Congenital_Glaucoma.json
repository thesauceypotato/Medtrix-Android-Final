The given case history and findings point towards the diagnosis of congenital glaucoma . Maldevelopment, from neural crest- derived cells, of trabeculum, including the iridotrabecular junction (trabeculodysgenesis), is responsible for impaired aqueous outflow, resulting in raised IOP . Tears and breaks in Descemet\u2019s membrane ( Haab\u2019s striae ) occur because Descemet\u2019s membrane is less elastic than the corneal stroma.

Flat iris insertion is more common than concave iris insertion. In it, the iris inserts flatly and abruptly into the thickened trabeculum, either at or anterior to scleral spur (more often) or posterior to scleral spur. It is often possible to visualize a portion of the ciliary body and scleral spur . Option: B. It is often possible to visualize a portion of the ciliary body and scleral spur in flat iris insertion; which is seen more commonly. Concave iris insertion is less common. In it the superficial iris tissue sweeps over the iridotrabecular junction and the trabeculum and, thus, obscures the scleral spur and ciliary body. Since concave iris insertion occurs in the majority of the cases, we can rule this option out as a statement of complete fact. Option: D.

It occurs along with the enlargement of globe-buphthalmos it usually seen in children less than 3 yearsof age. Normal infant cornea measures 10.5 mm. A diameter of more than 13 mm confirms enlargement. Lacrimation, photophobia, and blepharospasm often form the classic triad of symptoms of congenital glaucoma. The sclera becomes thin and appears blue due to underlying uveal tissue. The anterior chamber becomes deep . Iris may show iridodonesis and atrophic patches in the late stage. The lens becomes flat due to stretching of zonules and may even subluxate backward. Optic disc may show variable cupping and atrophy IOP is raised, but not acutely Axial myopia may occur because of increase in axial length which may give rise to anisometropic</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Investigation- Measurement of IOP with Schiotz or Perkin\u2019s applanation tonometer since scleral rigidity is very low in children Measurement of corneal diameter by callipers. Slit-lamp examination should be carried out with portable slit-lamp. Ophthalmoscopy to evaluate optic disc. Gonioscopic examination of angle of anterior chamber reveals with either flat or concave Rx - Drugs like CA inhibitors and beta blockers Surgical management Trabeculotomy + trabeculectomy is TOC Trabeculotomy is the 2nd TOC Goniotomy- is TOC for clear cornea</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Megalocornea - Megalocornea (MGC1) is a rare developmental defect characterized by nonprogressive, usually symmetric, bilateral enlargement of the diameter of the cornea (\u226513 mm). The cornea is clear and of normal or slightly below normal thickness. Option: B. Keratoconus -A condition in which the clear tissue on the front of the eye (cornea) bulges outward. With keratoconus, the clear, dome-shaped tissue that covers the eye (cornea) thins and bulges outward into a cone shape. Its cause is unknown. Symptoms first appear during puberty or the late teens and include blurred vision and sensitivity to light and glare. Option: D. Hunter\u2019s syndromes - Hunter syndrome is a very rare , inherited genetic disorder caused by a missing or malfunctioning enzyme. In Hunter syndrome, the body doesn't have enough of the enzyme iduronate 2-sulfatase .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Diagnosis Measurement of IOP with Schiotz or hand held Perkin\u2019s applanation tonometer .s Measurement of corneal diameter by callipers. gonioscopic examination of anterior chamber angle.</p>\n<p></p>",
