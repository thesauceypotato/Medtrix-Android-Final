      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Popliteus Popliteus serves in unlocking the knee; it rotates the distal portion of the femur in a lateral direction. It also draws the lateral meniscus posteriorly, thereby protecting this cartilage as the distal femoral condyle glides and rolls backwards as the knee is flexed. The popliteus is the smallest and most superior of the deep muscles in the posterior compartment of the leg. It unlocks the extended knee at the initiation of flexion and stabilises the knee by resisting lateral (external) rotation of the tibia on the femur.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Biceps Femoris The biceps femoris is a flexor of the leg and laterally rotates the knee when it is in a position of flexion. Option B. Gastrocnemius The Gastrocnemius is a powerful plantar flexor of the foot. Option D. Semimembranosus The Semimembranosus extends the thigh and flexes the leg at the knee joint.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "question_images": [],

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Movement of tibial tuberosity towards the lateral border of the patella In sitting posture( when the foot is off the ground), full extension leads to knee locking (by lateral rotation of the tibia). Hence, tibial tuberosity moves laterally towards the lateral border of the patella . The locking mechanism of the knee joint is a crucial function that allows the knee to bear weight and support the body\u2019s weight. It occurs when the knee is fully extended, and the patella (knee cap) locks into place in the femoral groove. The femoral groove is a depression in the femur that the patella fits into, providing stability to the knee joint.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The locking mechanism is controlled by the quadriceps muscle , located in the front of the thigh and is responsible for straightening the knee. When the quadriceps muscle contracts, it helps to stabilise the patella and prevent it from sliding out of place . This ensures the knee is locked in place and ready to bear weight. Locked Knee</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Movement of tibial tuberosity towards the medial border of the patella. Option C. Movement of tibial tuberosity towards the centre of the patella. Option D. No change in the Options A, C and D are incorrect because these movements are not involved during the locking of the knee when the foot is off the ground.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>One component of the locking mechanism is a change in the shape and size of the femoral surfaces that articulate with the tibia. In flexion, the surfaces are the curved and rounded areas on the posterior aspects of the femoral condyles. As the knee is extended, the surfaces move to the broad and flat areas on the inferior aspects of the femoral condyles. Consequently, the joint surfaces become more significant and more stable in extension. Another component of the locking mechanism is the medial rotation of the femur on the tibia during extension. Medial rotation and full extension tighten all the associated ligaments. Another feature that keeps the knee extended when standing is that the body's centre of gravity is positioned along a vertical line that passes anterior to the knee joint. The popliteus muscle unlocks the knee by initiating lateral rotation of the femur on the tibia.</p>\n<p></p>",
