The term \" chronic \" is sometimes used to make the definition clearer. IPO can be classified as primary or secondary. Primary IPO is rare and associated with enteric myopathies and neuropathies, while the cause of idiopathic IPO is unknown. Secondary IPO is linked to various underlying medical conditions, including connective tissue disease, radiation injury, amyloidosis, autonomic neuropathies such as diabetes and paraneoplasia, and infections like Chagas' disease .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Management of intestinal pseudo-obstruction includes: Nutrition support through enteral or parenteral means. Analgesia , with an effort to avoid opioids. Prokinetics may be considered, but they are generally not very effective. Antibiotics may be used to treat bacterial overgrowth. Immunotherapy may be used in specific cases with an inflammatory component, although the data is limited. Psychological support, including patient support groups, may be helpful for patients. Palliative care may be appropriate for some patients with advanced disease. Surgery is only considered in very selected cases.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Primary is more common than secondary Volvulus: A volvulus is a twisting or axial rotation of a portion of the bowel about its mesentery. The rotation causes obstruction to the lumen (>180\u00b0 torsion) and if tight enough also causes vascular occlusion in the mesentery (>360\u00b0 torsion). Bacterial fermentation adds to the distension and increasing intraluminal pressure impairs capillary perfusion. Mesenteric veins become obstructed as a result of the mechanical twisting and thrombosis results and contribute to the ischemia. Volvuli may be primary or secondary. The primary form occurs secondary to congenital malrotation of the gut, abnormal mesenteric attachments, or congenital bands. Examples include volvulus neonatorum, caecal volvulus, and sigmoid volvulus. A secondary volvulus, which is the more common variety, is due to the rotation of a segment of the bowel around an acquired adhesion or stoma. It may involve the small intestine, caecum, or sigmoid colon; neonatal midgut volvulus secondary to midgut malrotation is life-threatening The commonest spontaneous type in adults is sigmoid Sigmoid volvulus can be relieved by decompression per anum Surgery is required to prevent or relieve ischemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Volvulus is a condition in which a segment of the gastrointestinal tract twists or torsions, leading to obstruction of the intestinal lumen and potentially compromising blood flow to the affected area. The small intestine, caecum, and sigmoid colon are common sites of volvulus. In neonates, midgut volvulus resulting from abnormal rotation of the midgut during embryonic development can be a life-threatening emergency. In adults, sigmoid volvulus is the most common spontaneous form of volvulus.
