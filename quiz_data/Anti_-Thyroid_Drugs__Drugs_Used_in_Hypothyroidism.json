Two TR isoform families (TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2) have been identified. Both bind T3 and function in a similar manner, but their tissue distribution differs, which may account for quantitative differences in the sensitivity of different tissues to T3 In contrast to the steroid receptor, the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor (TR) resides in the nucleus even in the unliganded inactive state. It is bound to the \u2018thyroid hormone response element\u2019 (TRE) in the enhancer region of the target genes along with corepressors (This keeps gene transcription suppressed.) When T3 binds to the ligand-binding domain of TR, it heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and undergoes a conformational change releasing the corepressor and binding the coactivator. This induces gene transcription followed by the production of specific mRNA and a specific pattern of protein synthesis which produces the various metabolic and anatomic effects. The expression of certain genes is repressed by T3. In their case, the unliganded TR allows gene transcription, while binding of T3 to TR halts the process. Many of the effects of T3 e.g. tachycardia, arrhythmias, raised BP, tremors, and hyperglycemia are mediated, at least partly, by sensitization of adrenergic receptors to catecholamines. Induction of adenylyl cyclase, the proliferation of \u03b2 adrenoceptors, and a better coupling between these two have been demonstrated. Apart from the nuclear T3 receptor, other sites of thyroid hormone action have been described. It acts on cell membranes to enhance amino acid and glucose entry and on mitochondria to increase oxygen consumption. At these sites, T4 appears to be equipotent to T3 , which the nuclear receptor, T4 has a much lower affinity. Moreover, even on binding to the TR, T4 does not promote gene transcription.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options: A, B, and C.

Fertility is impaired in hypothyroidism and women suffer from oligomenorrhea. Normal thyroid function is required for the maintenance of pregnancy and lactation. During pregnancy, Induced by estrogen \u2192 thyroxine binding globulin is increased - PBI(Protein Bound Iodine) levels are elevated , but there is no effect on thyroid status because the concentration of free hormone remains unchanged. There will be a small amount of transplacental passage of L-T4 from mother to fetus. Therefore, A higher dose of levothyroxine is usually required in pregnant patients. Overt hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage , fetal distress , preterm delivery, and impaired psychosexual and motor development in the progeny. As part of pre-pregnancy planning, the dose of levothyroxine should be adjusted to maintain the TSH in the lower portion of the reference range. Levothyroxine (LT4) remains the mainstay of treatment of hypothyroidism in pregnant women. Women already diagnosed with hypothyroidism should have their TSH levels checked before conception or as soon as their pregnancy is confirmed to timely adjust the dosage of LT4. Various studies have proposed, that hypothyroid women can increase their LT4 dosage by approximately 30% as soon as the pregnancy is confirmed, thus anticipating the increased need.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options: B, C & D are incorrect.

After s.c. injection its plasma t\u00bd is ~ 3 hours and the duration of action is 6\u201310 hours. Injected s.c. Before breakfast and dinner, it is used as an add-on drug to metformin/ SU or a combination of these or pioglitazone in poorly controlled type 2 diabetics. Benefits noted are lowering of postprandial as well as fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and body weight. The most important side effect is nausea and vomiting occurring in ~ 50% of recipients, but tolerance develops later.

Because agranulocytosis can develop rapidly, periodic white cell counts usually are of little help, although a baseline white blood cell count and differential should be obtained before antithyroid drug treatment is initiated. Patients should be instructed to immediately report the development of sore throat or fever , which are often signs of the presence of leukopenia.
