It is often a part of pansinusitis or is associated with infection of the posterior ethmoid sinuses. CLINICAL FEATURES Headache. It is usually localized to the occiput or vertex. Pain may also be referred to the mastoid region. Postnasal discharge - It can only be seen on posterior rhinoscopy. A streak of pus may be seen on the nasopharynx's roof and the rear wall or above the middle turbinate's hind  end. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Mucocele of the sphenoid sinus or its neoplasms may clinically simulate features of acute infection of the sphenoid sinus. It should permanently be excluded in any case of isolated sphenoid sinus involvement. TREATMENT Treatment is the same as for acute infection of other sinuses.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Frontal headache is seen in maxillary and frontal sinusitis.

There is hyperemia and mucous membrane edema with seromucous glands' hypertrophy and increased goblet cells. Clinical Features Nasal obstruction - Usually worse on lying and affects the dependent side of the nose. Nasal discharge - It may be mucoid or mucopurulent Headache - It is due to swollen turbinates impinging on the nasal septum. Swollen turbinates - Nasal mucosa is dull red. Turbinates are swollen; they pit on pressure and shrink with vasoconstrictor drops (this differentiates the condition from hypertrophic rhinitis). Treatment Treat the cause with particular attention to sinuses Predisposing factors for the development of simple chronic rhinitis .
