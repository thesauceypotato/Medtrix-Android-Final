Nerve blocks are classified as peripheral nerve blocks and central neuraxial blocks. Central neuraxial blocks are blocks given along the central neuraxis and include spinal, epidural, saddle, and caudal. All other blocks are considered peripheral nerve blocks. Among the peripheral nerve blocks, the brachial plexus block is most often employed for upper limb surgeries.</p>\n<p></p>",

Its boundaries are defined anterior-laterally by the parietal pleura; posteriorly by the superior costotransverse ligament (thoracic levels); medially by the vertebrae, vertebral disk, and intervertebral foramina. The paravertebral block is given either for surgeries like mastectomy, nephrectomy (where GA is not possible), or for pain relief for surgeries or painful conditions. Complications from paravertebral blocks include inadvertent vascular puncture, hypotension, hematoma, epidural spread (via nerve sheath) spread to superior and inferior intercostal spaces and to other side through prevertebral space (if large volumes are used)</p>\n<p></p>",
