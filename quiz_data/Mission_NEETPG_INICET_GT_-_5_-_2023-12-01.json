The patient's presentation with severe eye pain, redness, diminution of vision, circumcorneal congestion, corneal edema, and a shallow anterior chamber is indicative of acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG). AACG is a medical emergency that requires prompt management to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) and relieve symptoms. Intravenous Mannitol is the preferred initial treatment choice for AACG because it has an osmotic effect, drawing fluid out of the eye and reducing IOP rapidly.</li><li>\u2022 OPTION B.</li><li>\u2022 Because of high IOP there\u2019s receptor level ischemia-this precludes use of topical medications as the receptors would not respond to topical medication. That is why systemic Mannitol is the DOC in case of AACG Attack.</li><li>\u2022 OPTION A. Atropine ointment: Atropine is a mydriatic agent (dilates the pupil) and is not the primary treatment for AACG. It may be used as an adjunct to help break the attack by dilating the pupil, but it should not be used as the sole treatment.</li><li>\u2022 OPTION A.</li><li>\u2022 OPTION C.

The echocardiographic findings of an enlarged left ventricle and a reduced ejection fraction of 35% are characteristic of dilated cardiomyopathy. This form of cardiomyopathy leads to systolic dysfunction, where the heart's ability to pump blood is decreased. The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes are significant risk factors for this condition. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (Answer B): This condition typically presents with asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and often a preserved or even increased ejection fraction. The patient\u2019s echocardiogram does not support this diagnosis. Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (Answer C): Restrictive cardiomyopathy is characterized by stiff ventricular walls that impair diastolic filling, usually with a normal ejection fraction. The echocardiogram findings in this case do not suggest restrictive cardiomyopathy. Acute Myocardial Infarction (Answer D): While an MI can lead to heart failure symptoms, the patient\u2019s presentation and echocardiographic findings are more chronic in nature and indicative of a dilated cardiomyopathy rather than an acute event.</li><li>\u2022 Dilated Cardiomyopathy (Answer A): The patient\u2019s symptoms of shortness of breath, fatigue, swollen ankles, and decreased exercise tolerance are consistent with heart failure.

It is often employed in techniques like DNA sequencing and DNA labeling, where the main goal is to synthesize new DNA strands by adding nucleotides in the 5'-3' direction. The removal of the 5'-3' exonuclease activity makes the Klenow fragment suitable for these applications because it prevents the fragment from degrading or proofreading the newly synthesized DNA strands by removing nucleotides from their 5' ends.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. C. ROP</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding eye disorder that affects premature infants. ROP occurs when the developing blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, are interrupted. The severity of ROP can vary, and it is classified into several stages based on its progression:</li><li>\u2022 Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP)</li><li>\u2022 Stage 1 ROP: Stage 1 ROP is the earliest and mildest form of the condition. In this stage, there is a demarcation line between the vascularized and avascular retina. Many infants with stage 1 ROP spontaneously improve without treatment. Stage 2 ROP: Stage 2 ROP is characterized by the appearance of a ridge of tissue. This ridge represents the border between the vascularized and avascular areas of the retina. Like stage 1, many infants with stage 2 ROP may improve on their own without intervention. Stage 3 ROP: Stage 3 ROP signifies the progression to more severe disease. In this stage, abnormal blood vessels begin to grow (neovascularization) from the retina into the vitreous gel inside the eye. These new vessels are fragile and can lead to retinal bleeding, scarring, and retinal detachment. Stage 4 ROP: Stage 4 ROP indicates a partially detached retina.

The X-ray findings of joint space narrowing and osteophytes are characteristic of osteoarthritis, making it the most likely diagnosis in this case.</li><li>\u2022 OPTION C:</li><li>\u2022 OPTION A: Gout: Gout is characterized by the sudden onset of severe joint pain, often affecting the big toe. It is caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to acute inflammation and swelling. The patient's gradual onset of joint pain, absence of significant swelling or redness, and X-ray findings are not consistent with gout.</li><li>\u2022 OPTION A:</li><li>\u2022 GOUT KNEE</li><li>\u2022 GOUT KNEE</li><li>\u2022 OPTION B: Rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that typically affects multiple joints symmetrically. It often presents with morning stiffness, joint swelling, and tenderness. The X-ray findings of joint space narrowing and osteophytes are not typical of rheumatoid arthritis.</li><li>\u2022 OPTION B:</li><li>\u2022 OPTION D: Psoriatic arthritis: Psoriatic arthritis is associated with psoriasis and can affect various joints, including the knees. It typically presents with joint pain, swelling, and skin lesions (psoriasis). While psoriatic arthritis can cause joint space narrowing, it is less common than osteoarthritis, and the absence of skin lesions makes it less likely in this case.</li><li>\u2022 OPTION D:</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

This disease is caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, which encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase in cells, which is required for excretion of copper from cells. So, copper is not excreted through bile, and hence copper toxicity .</li><li>\u2022 copper toxicity</li><li>\u2022 Increased copper content in hepatocyte inhibits the incorporation of copper to apo-ceruloplasmin. So ceruloplasmin level in blood is decreased . Clinical Features Accumulation in liver leads to hepatocellular degeneration and cirrhosis . Deposits in brain basal ganglia leads to lenticular degeneration and neurological symptoms. Copper deposits as green or golden pigmented ring around cornea; this is called Kayser-Fleischer ring. Treatment consists of a diet containing low copper and injection of D-penicillamine , which excretes copper through urine. Since zinc decreases copper absorption , zinc is useful in therapy.</li><li>\u2022 Increased copper content in hepatocyte inhibits the incorporation of copper to apo-ceruloplasmin.

Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JIA): JIA is a form of arthritis that affects children. In cases of JIA, especially when there is active inflammation or a history of severe eye involvement (e.g., uveitis), IOL implantation may be contraindicated due to the increased risk of postoperative complications and the potential for ongoing eye inflammation. Careful evaluation and consultation with both rheumatologists and ophthalmologists are essential in such cases to assess the risks and benefits of IOL implantation. In some instances, an alternative approach, such as contact lenses or glasses, may be considered for vision correction after cataract removal in patients with JIA-associated eye conditions.</li><li>\u2022 OPTION D.</li><li>\u2022 OPTION A.

While scrutinizing available literature for her PG research topic, she becomes intrigued by the correlation between maternal smoking and neonatal health. She hypothesizes that smoking during pregnancy might be a significant contributing factor to neonates being born with a low birth weight. To validate her hypothesis, She begins her study and starts gathering comprehensive data on the smoking habits of expectant mothers during their scheduled antenatal visits. Subsequently, as each baby is delivered, Dr. Verma meticulously notes down their birth weights. Given that the exposure, in this case, the smoking behavior, was recorded in anticipation of the future outcome, the birth weight. Which type of epidemiological research design is Dr. Verma utilizing?",

Both are common in MEN1. Family history of pituitary and thyroid tumors : MEN1 is associated with parathyroid tumors, pituitary tumors, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The family history of similar issues strongly suggests a hereditary pattern consistent with MEN1. Thyroid nodule : While not as classic for MEN1 as parathyroid or pituitary tumors, thyroid abnormalities can be associated with this condition. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2 (MEN2) (Answer B) : MEN2 more commonly involves medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid hyperplasia. The prominent features of gastrinoma and pituitary tumor in the patient's history are more characteristic of MEN1.

IgA Nephropathy is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. It is characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies in the glomerular mesangium. The finding of microscopic hematuria with red blood cell casts in the urinalysis further supports this diagnosis. The absence of significant proteinuria and the episodic nature of the symptoms, often following infections, are typical for IgA Nephropathy. Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis (Answer A): While this condition also presents with hematuria, it typically follows a streptococcal infection (like a sore throat or impetigo) and may include symptoms such as edema and hypertension. The urinalysis might show similar findings, but the history of episodic hematuria following respiratory infections is more indicative of IgA Nephropathy. Membranous Nephropathy (Answer C): Membranous Nephropathy typically presents with proteinuria, often in the nephrotic range, and is less commonly associated with hematuria. The clinical history provided does not align well with this diagnosis. Minimal Change Disease (Answer D): This condition primarily presents with nephrotic syndrome, characterized by significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. It is less likely to present with isolated hematuria and episodic symptoms post-infection, as seen in this patient.</li><li>\u2022 IgA Nephropathy (Berger\u2019s Disease) (Answer B): This patient's presentation of episodic gross hematuria that typically occurs following an upper respiratory tract infection is a classic feature of IgA Nephropathy.

She recalls falling deeply in love with multiple partners in the past, but these relationships often ended abruptly due to explosive arguments. Veena has a history of alternating between idealizing her partners and then suddenly feeling like they are entirely wrong for her. She struggles with a persistent fear of abandonment and has made impulsive decisions in attempts to avoid being alone, including getting tattoos, changing jobs, and relocating. Veena 's mood can shift rapidly, and she has a history of self-harming behaviors, especially after confrontations with her partners.

HBeAg is a marker of high levels of viral replication and therefore high infectivity. Vertical transmission (from mother to child) of hepatitis B is highly likely when the mother is both HBsAg and HBeAg positive. The infant\u2019s development of acute liver failure is consistent with a high viral load transmission, which is more likely in the setting of maternal HBeAg positivity. HbsAg positive only (Answer A): While being positive for HBsAg indicates that the mother is a carrier of hepatitis B, the absence of HBeAg would suggest a lower level of infectivity. However, this scenario is less consistent with the infant's severe presentation. HbsAg and anti-HBe antibody positivity (Answer C): The presence of anti-HBe antibodies along with HBsAg suggests a lower level of viral replication and hence a lower infectivity compared to the presence of HBeAg. This profile is less likely in a case where vertical transmission has led to acute liver failure in the infant.
