Fats stored in adipose tissues are broken down into fatty acids which undergo oxidation to give energy during fasting and starvation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect Options:- Option: A. Carbohydrates are the main source of fuel in the fed state. Dietary carbohydrates provide energy for 2 hours after diet. After that glycogen provides energy and can last up to 12-18 hours. RBC only uses glucose under all conditions as it lacks the mitochondria required for the beta-oxidation of fatty acid. Option: C. Under starvation conditions, the body starts using Proteins for energy when all carbohydrates and some fats are used up. However, body try to minimize the protein use by adapting to use ketone bodies produced from the fatty acid as fuel. Option: D. Under fasting/starvation, amino acids are released from muscle protein degradation and travel to the liver for use as energy and provide substrate for gluconeogenesis. Alanine is the most glucogenic amino acid and is released from fasting muscle and undergoes the Cahill cycle. Excess dietary amino acids from protein-rich diets can also contribute to a significant amount of energy under fed state.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Galactose Glycemic index (GI): It is a measure of the Increase in blood glucose after the test dose of carbohydrate compared with that of an equivalent amount of glucose. Glucose and galactose have a glycemic index of 1 (or 100%), the same as maltose, isomaltose, lactose, and trehalose, which form these monosaccharides on hydrolysis. GI is a value assigned to foods based on how slowly or how quickly those foods cause an increase in blood glucose levels. Foods with low-GI values are the preferred choice as they are slowly digested and absorbed, causing a slower and smaller rise in blood sugar levels. On the other hand, foods with a high GI value should be limited since they are quickly digested and absorbed, resulting in a rapid rise and fall in blood sugar levels Low GI (\u226455) Fructose, beans, grains Medium GI (56-69) Table sugar or sucrose High GI (\u226570) High fructose corn syrup, glucose, sweets, rice, maltose 1996</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect Options:- Option: A.

Alanine is an amino acid released from protein degradation in a fasting muscle cell. It travels to the liver and forms pyruvate by transamination. Pyruvate is then converted to glucose by gluconeogenesis without the formation of acetyl- This is known as the Cahill cycle. Pyruvate formed from alanine can also form acetyl-CoA for use in TCA.

So, the answer is liver gluconeogenesis. The figure below shows the role of the liver in the fed and fasting state under hormonal control.

Dietary glucose can provide blood glucose up to 2 hours after feeding. The extra glucose consumed in food gets deposited in the liver and muscles as glycogen and fats in adipose tissues. Option: C. The glycogenolysis of muscle gives glucose 6-phosphate as an end-product and not glucose due to the absence of the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase in muscles. Hence, muscle glycogen cannot contribute to blood glucose directly. Option: D. Glycogen breakdown in the liver can maintain blood glucose for 12-18 hours.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>RQ decreases & on giving Insulin it again increases In a normal person in a fed state, the main fuel for the body is carbohydrates . But in a diabetic patient, the main fuel for the body is fats as carbohydrate/glucose is not entering the cells due to relative or absolute deficiency of insulin. So, RQ decreases in Diabetes as the RQ of fats is less than the RQ for carbohydrates. But on giving Insulin, RQ again rises as glucose starts entering cells through GLUT-4 and now cells will again start using glucose.</p>\n<p></p>",
