The normal value for the AG is 6 to 12 mmol/L (an average of \u223c10 mmol/L). If hypoalbuminemia is present, the value for the AG must be corrected .

Severe acidemia (pH <7.00 to 7.15)\" in cases of wide anion gap acidosis, with signs of shock or myocardial irritability that has not responded to supportive measures including adequate ventilation and fluid resuscitation as indicated by the patient's clinical characteristics Therapy for the underlying cause of acidosis depends on adequate organ perfusion Severe hyperchloremic acidemia Lost bicarbonate must be regenerated by the kidneys and liver, which may require days. \"Presented as a range because recommendations differ among authors; data do not support a specific threshold for treatment. *No specific threshold indication by pH exists.

UAG = (Urine Na + urine K) \u2013Urine Cl (20 + 12) \u2013 12 = 20 ( Positive value ) If UAG is negative - Urine ammonium level is appropriately increased, suggesting an extra-renal cause of the acidosis. ( Option C is wrong ) If UAG is positive - Urine ammonium level is predictably low, suggesting a renal tubular origin of the acidosis. ( Option B is correct) The clinical scenario is likely of Sjogren\u2019s syndrome along with RTA (NAGMA plus hypokalemia)</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Ideal method to measure urine ammonium is by adaptation of automated plasma ammonium assays, using the enzymatic method , if the urine sample is diluted 1:200 in normal saline.</p>\n<p></p>",
