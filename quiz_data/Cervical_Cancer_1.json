Cervical cancer ,if it is not detected or left untreated, it can invade adjacent structures, one of which is the bladder wall. The progressive invasion of the bladder wall can lead to the obstruction of the ureters, which causes hydronephrosis. Cervical cancer can also cause hydronephrosis by direct obstruction of the ureters (proximal to the bladder). Hydronephrosis increases the retrograde hydrostatic pressure within tubules. Consequently, bilateral hydronephrosis can lead to a decline in the glomeruli filtration rate, ultimately resulting in acute renal failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>CERVICAL CANCER MODE OF  SPREAD ln initial stages, the cancer of cervix spreads by its continuity to adjoining structures (involving the vagina, parametrium and body of uterus).

C: Lymphedema of both upper and lower limb extremities Compression of veins or lymphatic vessels in the lesser pelvis will lead to lymphedema of the lower extremities but there is no involvement of upper extremities in Cervical CA. Option. D:Superior vena cava syndrome Superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) syndrome is caused by the obstruction of blood flow in the SVC. The most common cause of SVC Syndrome is malignancy, with lung cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma accounting for almost all the cases. Although the lung is a common site of distant metastasis in cervical cancer, it is not usually associated with SVC syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>COMPLICATION OF CERVICAL CANCER: Complications Mnemonic: Private FUND Private Pyometra F F istula:       - Vesico vaginal - Vesico cervical - Recto vaginal U U raemia N N ephrosis:   - Hydronephrosis - Pyonephrosis D D eath (most common cause of death is uraemia).</p>\n<p></p>",

These procedures have high cure rates, and successful pregnancies have been reported. Option: C.

This hysterectomy is well suited for tumors in patients with stage IA1 cervical cancer who have positive margins following conization and have insufficient cervix to repeat conization and stage IA1 cervical cancer with LVSI .

Vaginal radical trachelectomy is done only when these nodes are negative. Vaginal part includes resection of cervical, vaginal, paracervical and paravaginal tissues. Vaginal cuff is resected circumferentially about 2 cm below the cervicovaginal junction. Ideally, the resected cervical tissue margins should be free of disease as evaluated by frozen section.

It is done as an OPD procedure without anal- gesia. Cryosurgery is the best-tolerated technique, least painful and cheap. MECHANISM OF ACTION Cryosurgery refers to destruction of cells by crystallization of intracellular water. Freeze-thaw-freeze technique over 9 minutes destroys the tissue up to 4-5 mm depth. It is done as an OPD procedure without analgesia. CO2 (-60\u00b0C), Freon (-60\u00b0C) and nitrous oxide (-80\u00b0C) are the freezing agents. CO2 is cheaper, but nitrous oxide has a more cooling effect; hence, depth of penetration and destruction are more. A small lesion can be dealt with in one stroke applied for 3 minutes. A large lesion may require segments to be treated piecemeal. Application of acetic acid, Lugol's iodine or preferably colposcopic view helps to eradicate the entire lesion in one sitting. The woman should abstain from inter- course for 4 weeks. Repeat cryosurgery can be done 3 months later if the entire region is not previously treated as seen by cytology or other alternative method chosen. Disadvantages are as follows: Profuse discharge initially for a period of 7-10 days \u2022 Indrawing of squamocolumnar junction making subse- quent screening by colposcopy difficult ELECTROCOAGULATION Electrocoagulation uses temperature over 70\u00b0C and de- stroys the tissue up to 8-10 mm deep. The procedure is painful, so it is done under general anaesthesia. Complications: These include recurrence, bleeding, sepsis, cervical stenosis and indrawing of SCJ.
