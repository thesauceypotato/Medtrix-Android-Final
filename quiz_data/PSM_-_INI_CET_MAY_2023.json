From the options given above, KFD is transmitted by hard ticks, the principal vector being Haemaphysalis spinigera.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD): This is a hemorrhagic fever found in Karnataka state (India). Infection is transmitted by the  bite of ticks, the principal vector being Haemaphysalis  spinigera Hard ticks (Haemaphysalis spinigera) are the reservoir of KFD virus and once infected, remain so for life . Rodents, shrews, and monkeys are common hosts for KFDV after being bitten by an infected tick Clinical features : KFD has an abrupt onset of fever,  headache, conjunctivitis, myalgia and severe prostration. Some cases develop hemorrhages in the skin,  mucosa and viscera. Diagnosis can be made in the early stage of illness by molecular detection by PCR or virus isolation from blood. There is no specific treatment for KFD, but early hospitalization and supportive therapy is important. Supportive therapy includes the maintenance of hydration and the usual precautions for patients with bleeding disorders</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. Anaplasma: Anaplasmosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum. These bacteria are spread to people by tick bites primarily from the blacklegged tick Option B.

Tick typhus: Also known as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, an acute febrile (feverish) disease initially recognized in the Rocky Mountain states, caused by Rickettsia rickettsii transmitted by hard-shelled (ixodid) ticks</p>\n<p></p>",

The standard deviation of a population is denoted by \u03c3 and the standard deviation of  sample is denoted by just s.

It is particularly useful for normal distributions but can be used in skewed distributions.

All three carry equal importance and should be done simultaneously as per the category of exposure Management of animal bite wound(s) Passive immunization with Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG) Active immunization with Anti-Rabies Vaccines (ARV) Wound(s) toilet can be done by prompt and gentle thorough washing with soap or detergent and washing the wound(s) with running water. If soap and detergents are not immediately available,  wash with running water. The maximum benefit of the wound(s) washing is obtained when fresh wound(s) is cleaned immediately. The application of irritants (like chilies, oil, turmeric, lime, salt, etc) is unnecessary and damaging Application of antiseptics: After thorough washing and drying the wound(s), any one of the available chemical virucidal agents should be applied, such as povidone iodine, alcohol, etc. Local infiltration of rabies immunoglobulin : In category III exposures rabies immunoglobulin should be infiltrated in the depth and around the wound(s) to neutralize the locally present virus Suturing of wound(s) should be avoided as far as possible. If surgically unavoidable, after adequate cleansing, rabies immunoglobulin should be infiltrated in the depth and around the wound(s) and suturing should be delayed by a few hours. The delay in suturing allows diffusion of antibodies in the tissues. Minimum loose sutures should be applied for arresting the bleeding in life threatening situations. Cauterization of wound(s) is no longer recommended as it leaves bad scar, and does not confer any additional advantage over washing the wound(s) with water and soap Tetanus and antibiotic prophylaxis should be given if required . To prevent sepsis in the wound(s), a suitable course of an antibiotic may be recommended. Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in High-risk animal bites: Cat bites in any location and hand bites by any animals, including humans. Hand bites have a risk of developing an infection in the closed spaces of the hand High-risk patients: Comorbidities such as diabetes, liver disease, and absence of functional spleen. Patients without a functional spleen are at an increased risk for overwhelming sepsis primarily due to Capnocytophaga species Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the first-line drug of choice for prophylaxis. In patients with penicillin allerg clindamycin plus doxycycline/co-trimoxazole/fluoroquinolone can be used.</p>\n<p></p>",
