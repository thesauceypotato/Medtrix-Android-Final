      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Preoxygenation can increase oxygen reserve for up to 20 minutes The main reserve of oxygen in the body is in the lungs in the form of functional residual capacity (FRC) which is 2.4 liters. An FRC filled with air has only 500 ml of oxygen (21% of 2.4 liters). Considering the oxygen consumption of the body to be 250 ml/minute, this oxygen will last only for 2 minutes. If 95% of the nitrogen in FRC is replaced with oxygen, 2.3 liters of FRC now is constituted of oxygen which the body can consume for 8-9 minutes</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Preoxygenation means giving 100% oxygen before induction of anesthesia. It replaces 95% of nitrogen in the lungs (denitrogenation) with oxygen thereby increasing the oxygen reserve of the body. So, the patient will be able to sustain hypoxia for longer periods in case the anesthetists is not able to intubate or not ventilate. Option: B. In case of life-saving emergencies where there is no time for preoxygenation an alternative method is to give 4 breaths of full vital capacity with 100% oxygen</p>\n<p></p>",

Thiopentone had been the preferred agent for induction before the availability of propofol however it is not preferred nowadays because of its long half-life of > 10 hours Option: C. Ketamine because of its side effect (mainly vivid reactions) is not a preferred agent in current-day practice Option: D.

Stage III is considered a stage of surgical anesthesia and the onset of stage III is best indicated by the onset of regular respiration. Stage 3 was further divided into 4 planes. Plane 3 is considered as the plane of choice because laryngeal reflexes go in this plane.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>To demarcate the stages of anesthesia the induction should be very slow.
