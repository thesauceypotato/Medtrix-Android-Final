      "explanation": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness due to the destruction of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction by autoantibodies. Patients typically present with symptoms that worsen with activity and improve with rest, such as ptosis, diplopia, and bulbar symptoms including dysphagia and slurred speech. In this patient\u2019s case, the classic pattern of worsening symptoms throughout the day and improvement after rest is highly suggestive of MG. The dramatic response to anticholinesterase medications, like edrophonium, confirms the diagnosis by temporarily increasing acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, which improves muscle strength. Additional tests, including the ice pack test and acetylcholine receptor antibody testing, can further support the diagnosis.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome: This condition is associated with antibodies against presynaptic calcium channels, leading to impaired acetylcholine release.

Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Botulism: Botulism results from a neurotoxin that inhibits acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, causing descending paralysis, ptosis, and dysphagia.

Neck</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The commonest surgical approach to a retrosternal goiter is via the neck. This is because the thyroid gland is anatomically located in the neck, and even when a goiter extends behind the sternum into the chest, the neck provides the most direct and least invasive access for surgical removal. The retrosternal portion of the goiter can usually be mobilized and delivered into the neck for excision without the need for more invasive thoracic approaches. The vascular supply of the goiter also predominantly comes from cervical vessels like the inferior thyroid artery, making the neck approach feasible and effective.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Chest: Surgical approaches through the chest are typically not used for retrosternal goiters. Accessing the thyroid gland through the chest would involve more invasive procedures, such as thoracotomy, and is generally reserved for rare cases with specific indications, such as very large goiters extending deeply into the chest cavity.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Chest:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Median Sternotomy: Median sternotomy involves cutting through the breastbone (sternum) to access structures within the chest, particularly the heart and major blood vessels. While median sternotomy is common for cardiac surgeries, it is not the primary approach for treating retrosternal goiters, which can typically be addressed via the neck.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

This condition is characterized by inflammation, irritation, and a foamy or sticky discharge localized at the inner or outer corners of the eyes. The infection often originates from nasal secretions that spread to the eyes via contaminated hands or objects. Moraxella species are frequently found in the nasal passages of healthy individuals, and when transferred to the eyes, they cause localized canthal inflammation. Treatment typically involves topical antibiotics such as oxytetracycline, with a course lasting 10 to 14 days, which effectively resolves the infection.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
