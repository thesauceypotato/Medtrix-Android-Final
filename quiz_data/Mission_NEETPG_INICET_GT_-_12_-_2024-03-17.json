An anemic fetus (For e.g. due to fetal red cell destruction in an Rh iso-immunized mother) will re-direct blood flow to more important organs like the brain. This is reflected by an increased flow in the middle cerebral artery which can be measured by doing a Doppler of the MCA. In Rh immunized mothers, when indirect Coomb\u2019s Test (ICT) titers rise above the critical titer of 1:16, then MCA doppler peak systolic velocity (PSV) is used for monitoring fetal anemia and development of hydrops in these babies.
