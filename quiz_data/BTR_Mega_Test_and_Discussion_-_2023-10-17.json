The patient becomes agitated, hypervigilant, and paranoid 12 hours after admission. He repeatedly tells the nurses that he can hear people in the corridor making insulting remarks about him. When hospital staff check the area near the patient's room, no one is found. Medical history is unremarkable, but psychiatric history is significant for cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol misuse. On examination, the patient is alert and oriented. Temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 135/87 mm Hg pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 18/min. He is slightly tremulous and diaphoretic.
