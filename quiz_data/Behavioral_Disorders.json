She reports that he does not respond when his name is called, avoids making eye contact, and prefers to play alone. The child has a particular interest in lining up his toy cars and becomes extremely upset with any change in routine. His play is repetitive, and he shows little interest in playing with other children. On examination, the pediatrician notes that the child does not follow pointing gestures and does not point at objects to show interest. Based on the clinical presentation, the pediatrician suspects autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Which of the following is a common clinical feature of ASD?",

The child has been previously diagnosed with an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. The child presents with intellectual disability, a common manifestation of this metabolic condition. The pediatrician recognizes this as a classic presentation of Phenylketonuria (PKU), a disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize phenylalanine, leading to its accumulation and subsequent neurotoxic effects. Given the context of genetic disorders and their association with intellectual disability, the pediatrician considers other conditions that might present similarly.

His teacher reports that despite average intelligence and effort, the child struggles to recognize words, confuses letters that look similar, and has difficulty understanding the sounds letters make. The child's mother adds that he had delayed speech milestones and has always found rhyming games challenging, unlike his peers. The psychologist observes the child's reading session and notes significant difficulty in decoding simple words, which impacts his reading fluency and comprehension. Given the child's history of delayed speech, difficulty with phonological awareness, and specific challenges with reading and writing, dyslexia is suspected.

The boy also exhibits fidgetiness, has difficulty remaining seated, and often interrupts others. After a comprehensive evaluation, he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
