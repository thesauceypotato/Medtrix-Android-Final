Many women with CKD require antihypertensive medications to control their blood pressure, which is crucial in preventing further renal damage and managing complications like preeclampsia. However, the choice of antihypertensive medication may need to be adjusted due to pregnancy, as some medications are contraindicated or not preferred during pregnancy.</li><li>\u2022 Option A:</li><li>\u2022 Option B: Strict protein restriction: This approach is controversial and not generally recommended during pregnancy. While protein restriction can sometimes be beneficial in non-pregnant CKD patients to slow disease progression, during pregnancy, adequate protein intake is essential for fetal growth and development. Dietary modifications in pregnant CKD patients should be individualized and carefully balanced.</li><li>\u2022 Option B:</li><li>\u2022 Option D: Starting or continuing dialysis in a pregnant woman with CKD depends on the severity of the renal impairment and is not routinely initiated based solely on the presence of CKD.

Methimazole Is associated with a rare methimazole embryopathy, characterized by: Esophageal or choanal atresia Aplasia cutis, a congenital skin defect. However, treatment with PTU is associated with a higher risk for liver injury The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (2011) recommend PTU therapy during the first trimester followed by a switch to methimazole beginning in the second trimester. More recently, the American Thyroid Association recommends PTU therapy through 16 weeks\u2019 gestation but does not make a recommendation regarding switching to methimazole treatment because both agents are associated with adverse effects and the harm from poorer control during the switch is unknown but the better answer to this question is to start with PTU and then switch to methimazole. Transient leukopenia can be documented in up to 10 percent of women taking antithyroid drugs, but this does not require therapy cessation.
