      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The intrapleural pressure in the affected area is equal to the atmospheric pressure In a pneumothorax, air enters the pleural cavity between the parietal and visceral pleura, causing the lung to collapse. The intrapleural pressure in the affected area is equal to atmospheric pressure because the pressure in the pleural cavity becomes equal to atmospheric pressure. This means there is no pressure gradient to keep the lung inflated.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>When air enters the pleural space due to interruption of the pleural surface through either the rupture of the lung or a hole in the chest wall, the pressure in the pleural space becomes atmospheric, and the lung on the affected side collapses because of the lung\u2019s tendency to recoil inward, and the chest wall on the affected side recoils outward.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option B. The chest wall on the affected side recoils outward, and there is a decrease in lung volume due to the collapse of the lung. Option C. Hyperinflation of the remaining lung may occur in a compensatory effort to maintain gas exchange. Option D . With the collapse of the lung, the V \u02d9/Q \u02d9 ratio on the affected side decreases.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Ventilation/perfusion\n  mismatch Ideally, ventilation (V)\n  is matched to perfusion (Q) per minute (ie, dot V / dot Oratio = 1 ) for\n  adequate gas exchange. Lung zones: VIO at apex of lung = 3 (wasted\n  ventilation) VIO at base of lung = 0.6\n  (wasted perfusion) Both ventilation and perfusion are greater at the base of\n  the lung than at the apex of the lung. With exercise (t cardiac output),\n  there is vasodilation of apical capillaries dot V / O ratio approaches 1. Certain organisms that\n  thrive in high O_{2} (eg, TB) flourish in the apex. dot V / dot Q =0=^ ``\n  oirway \" obstruction (shunt). In shunt, 100% O_{2} does not improve Pao,\n  (eg, foreign body aspiration). dot V / dot O = \u221e = blood\n  flow obstruction (physiologic dead space). Assuming < 100% dead space,\n  100% O_{2} improves Pao, (eg, pulmonary embolus).</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Respiratory volume The correct answer is D. Respiratory volume. During physical activity, the respiratory volume (also known as tidal volume) increases to allow for increased oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide elimination.

Respiratory volume is the index of external respiration that is much higher during physical activity than in a state of rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>During physical exercises, the sympathetic nervous system causes dilation of the bronchi, therefore, the respiratory volume (tidal volume) that a person inhales and exhales increases.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Options A. & B. The inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional volumes of air that can be inhaled or exhaled beyond the normal tidal volume.

Air in the conducting zone of the bronchial tree.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Dead space refers to air in the conducting zone of the bronchial tree that does not participate in gas exchange with the blood.
