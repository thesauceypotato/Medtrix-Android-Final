Specifically, women with an abrupt onset, typically within several months . Symptoms may include deepening of the voice, frontal balding, severe acne or hirsutism, or both, increased muscle mass, and clitoromegaly. Total testosterone beyond 200 ng /dl of warrant evaluation for an ovarian lesion. Therefore testosterone estimation is the best investigation in case of rapid onset hirsutism and amenorrhea.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Causes of Hirsutism: Hirsutism is associated with excess androgen production (either from ovaries or adrenals), so any cause which increases androgens causes hirsutism. Most of the testosterone is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and is considered biologically inactive. Testosterone which is not bound to SHBG is considered biologically active, therefore any factor which decreases SHBG; causes an increase in free testosterone and therefore causes hirsutism.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B: DHEA sulfate is produced exclusively by the adrenal gland. Therefore, serum DHEAS levels above 700 mcg/dl are highly sensitive to the presence of an adrenal neoplasm. Adrenal imaging with abdominal CT or MRI is indicated for any patient with DHEAS levels that exceed this value. Options C and D : are not appropriate.</p>\n<p></p>",
