(where there is the most significant volume of inspired air.) The focus is usually tiny (< 1cm). Microscopically, typical caseating granulomas are seen. Organisms drain to hilar nodes, again with the formation of granulomas . Primary (Ghon) Complex = Primary focus + involvement of regional lymph nodes in primary TB. Primary foci are usually entirely asymptomatic. The old sites of the healed primary TB infection may be marked by a pulmonary nodule or granuloma in the lung, which may become calcified over time. These nodules are known as \"Ghon lesions.\" The finding is called \" Ranke's complex \" when seen together with ipsilateral calcified hilar adenopathy; the result is termed a \u201cRanke\u2019s complex.\u201d Apical scarring with the appearance of a fibronodular patch or ill-defined reticular shadow in the upper lung fields on chest x-ray is known as \"Simon's focus, \" and in a patient with a positive tuberculin skin test identifies a patient with a markedly increased risk for active TB.

The most common lung condition in diffuse systemic sclerosis is interstitial lung disease. It is associated with decreased diffusion capacity and restrictive patterns on DLCO. The pulmonary function test also points towards a restrictive pathology. So the lung condition can be streamlined as ILD. The pathogenesis represents - interstitial lung disease where there is remodeling of the region between the alveolar epithelium and endothelium of vessels.</p>\n<p></p>",
