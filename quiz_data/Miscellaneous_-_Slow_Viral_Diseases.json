      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Anterior horn of the spinal cord The patient most likely has acute poliomyelitis , caused by the poliovirus , a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Enterovirus family . Poliovirus destroys the motor neurons of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, resulting in flaccid asymmetric paralysis and muscle atrophy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The disease has 2 basic patterns: Abortive poliomyelitis: a minor self-limited illness that does not involve the central nervous system (CNS). Acute flaccid paralysis: a major paralytic illness that involves the CNS. About 1\u20135 in 1,000 cases progress to paralytic disease in which the skeletal muscles become poorly controlled, weak, floppy, and atrophied . Poliovirus is highly contagious. It spreads via the faecal-oral route and respiratory droplets. Several factors that increase the risk of polio infection and affect the severity of the disease include comorbid immune deficiency, malnutrition, and engaging in physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis. The poliovirus vaccine is very successful and almost all countries, except Pakistan and Afghanistan, have been largely polio-free due to proper immunization.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. The basal ganglia play an important part in controlling voluntary movements. Parkinson\u2019s disease and Huntington\u2019s disease are degenerative conditions that affect the basal ganglia . Neuro-Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, several types of Flavivirus, and CNS toxoplasmosis are some of the infections affecting the basal ganglia. Option B. Poliovirus destroys the anterior (not the posterior) horn of the spinal cord. Option C. Demyelination occurs in multiple sclerosis . It also occurs in certain cases where a viral invasion of the CNS occurs, such as with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1\u2013associated myelopathy.</p>\n<p></p>",
