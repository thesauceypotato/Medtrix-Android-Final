Urethral obstruction can cause dilation of the posterior urethral valve, bladder, and bilateral hydronephrosis, leading to a keyhole sign on prenatal ultrasound and potentially oligohydramnios. If not detected prenatally, PUV may present postnatally as a newborn or young infant with urinary tract symptoms, abdominal distension or and recurrent UTIs. Left untreated, PUV may result in chronic kidney disease, bladder dysfunction, and vesicoureteral reflux. Diagnosis of PUV is typically based on the presence of an elongated posterior valve during the voiding phase of the voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG).</li><li>\u27a4 The most frequent cause of bladder outflow obstruction in male children is the posterior urethral valve (PUV).</li><li>\u27a4 PUV is a membranous fold located in the posterior urethra, typically found just distal to the verumontanum.

C) Olmesartan</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Olmesartan, along with eprosartan, is unique among Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) in that it does not require dose adjustment in patients with either renal or hepatic impairment, making it safe for use in such conditions. This is due to its minimal dependence on renal or hepatic clearance pathways compared to other ARBs.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Telmisartan \u2013 Telmisartan requires dose adjustment in hepatic impairment due to its biliary excretion and is avoided in severe renal failure.</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Telmisartan</li><li>\u2022 Option B: Irbesartan \u2013 Irbesartan is contraindicated in severe renal and hepatic failure, as it relies on both pathways for metabolism and clearance.</li><li>\u2022 Option B: Irbesartan</li><li>\u2022 Option D: Losartan \u2013 While losartan has additional thromboxane A2 receptor antagonism and antiplatelet effects, it requires dose adjustment in hepatic impairment and should be avoided in severe renal disease due to the risk of hyperkalemia.</li><li>\u2022 Option D: Losartan</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Among ARBs, olmesartan and eprosartan stand out for their safety in both severe renal and hepatic impairment without requiring dose adjustment. Understanding these exceptions is critical for optimizing treatment in patients with comorbidities.</li><li>\u27a4 olmesartan and eprosartan</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
