The nystagmus that occurs on gaze towards the side of the lesion is gaze-evoked nystagmus caused by defective gaze holding, whereas the nystagmus that occurs during gaze towards the side opposite the lesion is caused by vestibular imbalance.

It is a physiological jerk nystagmus induced by presenting to gaze the objects moving serially in one direction, such as strips of a spinning optokinetic drum.

It may be characterised by any of the following features: Waveform : Pendular or jerk nystagmus. In pendular nystagmus, movements are of equal velocity in each direction. It may be horizontal, vertical or rotatory. In jerk nystagmus , the movements have a slow component in one direction (defoveating movement, i.e. the movement that moves the fovea away from the object and a fast component in another direction (refoveating saccadic movement), i.e. the refixation movement that brings the object of interest back at fovea in the other direction.

Direction of nystagmus may be horizontal, vertical, rotatory, torsional, oblique or a combination of these. Amplitude of nystagmus may be small, medium or large. Rate or frequency of nystagmus may be fast (rapid), or slow. Generally speaking faster the rate, the smaller the amplitude and vice versa.

Manifest (present all the time) or latent (present only when one eye is covered). Nystagmus : Rapid rhythmic repetitive involuntary (uncontrollable) eye movements. Nystagmus can be horizontal, vertical or rotary and can effect one or both eyes. This is caused by abnormal function in the area of the brain that controls eye movement. Forms of the Disease Infantile or congenital: Most common and usually present at birth. It can be inherited or associated with a sensory deficit which in turn is most likely responsible for the greater part of vision loss. People affected are not aware of their rapid eye movements but instead are observed by others. Acquired Nystagmus: There are several causes that lead to juvenile and adult onset of nystagmus... Inner ear disorders (labyrinthitis or Meniere's disease) Toxic-drugs, medication (such as antiseizure medications and sedating meds), alcohol intoxication Head injury Stroke (blood vessel blockage in the brain) Diseases of the brain....multiple sclerosis or brain tumors Treatments and Modifications: Movements of large magnitude may require surgery to improve visual acuity. Contacts or glasses can be worn to reduce Congenital nystagmus. Avoid emotional strain, such as stress, tiredness or nervousness. Angle of vision is important, eye muscle surgery may improve the head position and allow for better vision.

It is characterized by smooth, continuous, slow (1-3 Hz), pendular, convergent-divergent nystagmus, concurrent contractions of the masticatory muscles , supranuclear vertical gaze palsy, and occasionally, rhythmic movements of the limbs. It differs from other forms of pendular nystagmus in that it is smooth and continuous with a high amplitude and slow frequency . These eye movements may persist during sleep. Pathogenesis & Epidemiology Whipple\u2019s disease is a rare systemic disorder that primarily affects the gastrointestinal system causing malabsorption , although it can affect any part of the body. It often presents with symptoms of weight loss, steatorrhea, arthralgia, fever, and sometimes, neurologic findings like dementia and somnolence . It is caused by the bacteria Tropheryma whipplei which predominantly infects macrophages of the small intestines. The specific findings of OMM are thought to be due to lesions in the midbrain and upper pons Definite CNS WD Must have any 1 of the following 3 criteria: OMM or OFSM Positive tissue biopsy Positive PCR analysis Treatment It has been shown that the most efficient treatment may be with doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine. Another generally accepted treatment regimen for WD with OMM or OFSM is daily IV ceftriaxone or penicillin G for two weeks, followed by TMP-SMX twice a day for a year. However, chloramphenicol, TMP-SMX, tetracycline, erythromycin, and ceftriaxone are all antibiotics that can cross the blood-brain-barrier and have been found to be effective in WD with CNS manifestations</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A . Convergence nystagmus can also be seen in these patients but can also be associated with other conditions like Arnold Chiari malformation, and Option : B. Divergence nystagmus is not seen in Whipple\u2019s It can occur in cases with Arnold Chiari malformation</p>\n<p></p>",
