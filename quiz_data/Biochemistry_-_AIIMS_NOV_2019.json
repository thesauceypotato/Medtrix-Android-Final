      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Phenylbutyrate In all urea cycle disorders there is accumulation of NH 3 (hyperammonemia) which is very toxic and has to be removed. Using scavenging agents:- One of the treatments of urea cycle disorder is the use of NH 3 scavenging agents. These are Phenylbutyrate and Sodium benzoate. Phenyl butyrate reacts with glutamine to get converted into phenyl acetyl glutamine which can be excreted. Other method to treat urea cycle disorder is Arginine supplementation (1st line treatment) : Arginine is an essential amino acid. It provides ornithine (required in 2nd step of urea cycle) which is an activator of NAGS. But it is contraindicated in Arginase deficiency</p>\n<p></p>",
