It is also called pincushion distortion - Pincushions are typically filled tightly with stuffing to hold pins rigidly in place. Magnetic pin cushions are also sometimes used; though technically they are not \"cushions\", they serve the same basic function of holding pins neatly. Option: C. It is due to asymmetrical convex lenses in both the eyes A (general, asymmetric) lens is a lamina formed by the intersection of two offset disks of unequal radii such that the intersection is not empty, one disk does not completely enclose the other, and the centres of curvatures are on opposite sides of the lens.
