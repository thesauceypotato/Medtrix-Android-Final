      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Essential thrombocythemia In the given scenario, a patient presents with thrombocytosis with abnormalities in size, shape and granularity of platelets , with normal WBC count & haemoglobin and the absence of the Philadelphia chromosome . The most likely diagnosis, in this case, would be Essential Thrombocythemia</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Essential Thrombocytosis (ET): Essential thrombocytosis (ET) is associated with diverse mutations that increase JAK-STAT signalling and mimic constitutive growth factor receptor signalling. ET manifests clinically with elevated platelet counts and is separated from PCV and primary myelofibrosis based on the absence of polycythemia and marrow fibrosis, respectively . M:F 1.5: 1 Age: 50-60 years Thrombosis - Microvascular occlusion, gangrene, Myocardial infarction, DVT, etc Bleeding (abnormal platelet granules). The characteristic symptom is Erythromelalgia , a throbbing and burning of hands and feet caused by occlusion of small arterioles by platelet aggregates, which also may be seen in PCV . Bone marrow cellularity is usually only mildly increased , but megakaryocytes are often markedly increased in number and include abnormally large forms . Peripheral smears usually reveal abnormally large platelets , often accompanied by mild leukocytosis . Modest degrees of extramedullary hematopoiesis may occur, producing mild organomegaly . Essential thrombocytosis. Peripheral blood smear shows marked thrombocytosis including giant platelets approximating the size of surrounding red cells. Diagnosis All 4 major or 3 major +1 minor 1.

Polycythemia vera. An increase in Hb or HCT is seen with Panmyelosis. Option: C. Chronic myeloid leukaemia. Peripheral smear shows leukocytosis with the presence of immature myeloid precursors e. shift to left and is associated with basophilia . Option: D. Leukemoid reaction. The leukemoid reaction is a reactive condition that can mimic CML but is usually secondary to an underlying infection or inflammation, presents with leukocytosis and shift to the left .</p>\n<p></p>",
