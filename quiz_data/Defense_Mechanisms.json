      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Displacement Displacement (in psychiatry) is a neurotic defense mechanism in which an individual redirects negative emotions from their real target to a neutral third party. The neutral third party is often a subordinate or less threatening entity. The computer scientist is displacing his anger at his senior associate to his intern.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option : A . Projection (psychiatry) is an immature defense mechanism in which the individual attributes his/her thoughts, emotions, or behavior to another individual(s). For example, the computer scientist had a poor performance because he was lazy; he attributes his student's poor performance to laziness as well when the student's poor performance could have been the result of ill health. Option : C . Countertransference is a term used in psychoanalysis to refer to the effect that the patient has on the psychotherapist. Countertransference is not a defense mechanism. Option : D . Reaction formation is a neurotic defense reaction in which an individual replaces an undesired idea or feeling by acting in a diametrically opposite fashion. For example, a nymphomaniac who becomes a nun, or a man who insults a woman because he is in love with her.</p>\n<p></p>",

Transference refers to the unconscious redirection of feelings from a past experience with one object to a current experience with another object that has a perceived or real similarity to the first object .

Repression involves the unconscious removal of unpleasant or distressing thoughts from conscious awareness.
