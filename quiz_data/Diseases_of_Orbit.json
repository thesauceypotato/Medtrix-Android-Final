      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis Cavernous sinus thrombosis is sequela, resulting from the spread of sepsis travelling along its tributaries from the infected sinuses, teeth, ears, nose, and skin of the face. Very rarely cavernous sinus thrombosis may also occur after trauma (head injury). Communications of the cavernous sinus and sources of infection . Anteriorly, the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins drain into the sinus. These veins receive blood from the face, nose, paranasal sinuses and orbits. Therefore, infection to the cavernous sinus may spread from infected facial wounds, erysipelas, squeezing of style, furuncles, orbital cellulitis and sinusitis . Posteriorly, the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses leave it to join the lateral sinus. Labyrinthine veins opening into the inferior petrosal sinuses bring infections from the middle ear. Mastoid emissary veins may spread infection from the mastoid air cells. Superiorly, the cavernous sinus communicates with veins of the cerebrum and may be infected by meningitis and cerebral abscesses. Inferiorly , the sinus communicates with the pterygoid venous plexus. Medially , the two cavernous sinuses are connected with each other by transverse sinuses which account for the transfer of infection from one side to the other.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Clinical features Cavernous sinus thrombosis starts initially as a unilateral condition, which soon becomes bilateral due to intercavernous communication. General features. Most patients are seriously ill having high-grade fever with chills and rigours, vomiting and headache. Ocular features include: Severe pain in the eye and forehead on the affected side. Conjunctiva is swollen and congested. Proptosis Ipsilateral ophthalmoplegia, causing diplopia, may occur due to palsy of the 3rd, 4th and 6th cranial nerves. Ipsilateral ptosis, dilated pupil, and absence of direct as well as consensual pupillary light reflex are signs of 3rd nerve palsy. Corneal anaesthesia, i.e., loss of corneal reflex , may occur due to the involvement of the ophthalmic division of the 5th cranial nerve. Oedema in the mastoid region is a pathognomonic sign. It is due to back pressure in the mastoid emissary vein.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Orbital cellulitis Option: C. Acute ethmoidal sinusitis Option: D. Orbital apex syndrome</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Investigations CT scan head and orbit may show involvement of cavernous sinuses and proptosis. Magnetic resonance venography (angiography) is the investigation of choice which shows an absence of flow void in thrombosed sinuses. A blood culture is recommended for sepsis. Complications - hyperpyrexia and signs of meningitis or pulmonary infarction may precede death.</p>\n<p></p>",

These sinuses are just lateral and superior to the sphenoid sinus and are immediately posterior to the optic chiasm, Periorbital edema may be the earliest physical finding. Chemosis results from occlusion of the ophthalmic veins. Lateral gaze palsy (isolated cranial nerve VI) is usually seen first since CN VI lies freely within the sinus in contrast to CN III and IV, which lie within the lateral walls of the sinus.
