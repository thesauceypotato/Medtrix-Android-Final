Sulfamethoxazole+Trimethoprim is a combination medicine that is used to treat various types of bacterial infections such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and infections of the urinary tract, ear, and abdomen.

Sulfadoxine/ sulfamethopyrazine + pyrimethamine is a sulfonamide antibiotic that competes with p-aminobenzoic acid in the biosynthesis of folate. Pyrimethamine serves as a selective inhibitor of protozoal dihydrofolate reductase, hence preventing the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate Option: C . Flucytosine (5-FC ), is an antifungal medication.

Rationally, by blocking the first stepin folic acid synthesis, there is\nno real reason to block further steps. However, there are some bacteria which\ncan inhibits the initial blockage, and so this may be the rationale for the use\nof such combination. -There is synergy between the two drugs - the combined effect is greater\nthat the expected sum of their activities -Individually the drugs are bacteriostatic; however, in combination they\nare bactericidal -The use of two drugs will delay the emergence of resistance.</p>\n<p></p>",
