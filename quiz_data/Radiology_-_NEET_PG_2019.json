Ureteric Calculus ;Ureterolithiasis, also known as ureteric calculi, is the presence or formation of stones within the ureters, which are the tubes responsible for the passage of urine from the kidneys to the bladder.

Right ventricle Option B, C, D are incorrect as Left atrium compress the esophagus in patient with mitral stenosis</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Mitral stenosis is a valvular heart disease characterized by the narrowing of the opening of the mitral valve of the heart. It is almost always caused by rheumatic valvular heart disease. Normally, the mitral valve is about 5 cm 2 during diastole. Any decrease in area below 2 cm 2 causes mitral stenosis. Early diagnosis of mitral stenosis in pregnancy is very important as the heart cannot tolerate increased cardiac output demand as in the case of exercise and pregnancy. Atrial fibrillation is a common complication of resulting left atrial enlargement, which can lead to systemic thromboembolic complications such as stroke.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

It is a curvilinear bundle of white matter fibers that begins as a group of myelinated fibers called the alveus. The alveus joins to form the fimbria of the hippocampus.
