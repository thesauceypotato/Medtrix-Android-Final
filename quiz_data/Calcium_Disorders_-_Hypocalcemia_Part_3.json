      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Calcium gluconate Based on the picture .the patient is having Chvostek sign that is twitching of the circumoral muscles in response to gentle tapping of the facial nerve just anterior to the ear It is present normally in 10 percent of the individual But here in the clinical findings there is also carpopedal spasm induced by inflation of blood pressure cuff to 20 mM Hg above the patient's systolic BP , called as trousseau sign This correlates with the finding of hypocalcemia Here the patient is symptomatic hence the correct answer is Option: B calcium gluconate</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A calcium supplement A Calcium supplement is given in case of chronic hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism. Option: C vitamin d metabolites In the treatment of hypocalcemia, vitamin D is now not generally used. It is used less frequently, but vitamin D deficiency is best treated using vitamin D supplementatio n. Option: D-magnesium supplementation In the question the patient is given only with signs of hypocalcemia. If there is accompanying hypomagnesemia, it should be treated with magnesium supplementation. Otherwise, only the correction of hypocalcemia is important.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Acute symptomatic hypocalcemia essentially is managed with calcium gluconate, 10 millilitre for 10 percent weight per volume, intravenously diluted in 50 ml of 5 percent dextrose is given intravenously over 5 minutes</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Iv saline Here, the patient is a known anorexic. She complained of tingling in hands, feet, and around mouth. This is a classic sign of the tetany in adults with hypocalcemia. The patient is anorexic, meaning she is having malabsorption This will cause decrease in calcium, leading to hypocalcemia which leads to tetany. The patient is having a persistent vomiting Hence, the next line of treatment should be iv saline to prevent the dehydration and possible worsening of the condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A calcium gluconate In acute cases of tetany the main treatment is injection of iv calcium gluconate with maintenance therapy However here persistent vomiting is present ,that should be taken care of first Option: C magnesium replacement This is done in cases of the presentation of hypomagnesemia along with the hypocalcemia ; here in the question, it is not mentioned though. Hence, this is not needed as of now. Option: D- Give a bag and tell her to rebreathe. This is done in cases of hyperventilation leading to metabolic alkalosis. Rebreathing will increase the carbon dioxide and neutralize the alkalosis component.</p>\n<p></p>",
