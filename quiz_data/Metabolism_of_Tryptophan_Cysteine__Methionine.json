      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>It contains an imidazole group and thus is a polar aromatic amino acid The amino acid shown is Tryptophan which contains an indole side chain. It is a non-polar aromatic amino acid. Imidazole ring is present in proline. Tryptophan is an essential and alpha-amino acid. It is a proteinogenic (present in proteins) amino acid. Tryptophan contains an indole side chain and thus is a non-polar aromatic amino acid. Tryptophan serves as the biochemical precursor of serotonin, niacin, and melatonin. Serotonin is produced through a tryptophan hydroxylase reaction. Melatonin is produced from serotonin through N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase enzymes.</p>\n<p></p>",
