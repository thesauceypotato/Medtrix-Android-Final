The fall in 2, 3 DPG is less</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 The fall in 2, 3 DPG is less when the blood is stored in CPDA compared with ACD.</li><li>\u2022 The ease with which hemoglobin releases oxygen to the tissues is controlled by erythrocytic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) such that an increase in the concentration of 2,3-DPG decreases oxygen affinity and vice versa.</li><li>\u2022 In stored blood, the 2,3 DPG levels usually fall, thus less oxygen is released to the tissues. Therefore, its use in hypoxic patients (E.g., anemia) is limited.</li><li>\u2022 Phosphate-containing solution like CPDA (Citrate, phosphate, dextrose, adenine) prevents the fall in 2.3DPG levels. Higher 2,3 DPG concentration decreases affinity of Hb to the oxygen releasing oxygen to the tissues.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Decreased release of O2 : Incorrect. The goal of effective blood storage solutions like CPDA is to ensure that the oxygen release capacity is maintained, not decreased.

P50 is a measure of the oxygen tension at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated with oxygen. A higher P50, indicative of lower oxygen affinity, is preferable in stored blood as it means oxygen is more readily released to tissues\u2014a trait supported by higher 2,3-DPG levels.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. It has less P50</li><li>\u2022 Option D. It is less acidic : Incorrect. While pH maintenance is important in blood storage, the primary benefit of CPDA over ACD is not related to less acidity but to its inclusion of phosphate and adenine, which help sustain energy (ATP) production and 2,3-DPG levels in red blood cells.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. It is less acidic</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The use of CPDA in blood storage is superior to ACD due to its phosphate content, which helps maintain higher levels of 2,3-DPG in stored red blood cells. This biochemical preservation is crucial for ensuring that transfused blood can effectively release oxygen to hypoxic tissues, making CPDA the preferred choice in clinical settings where blood transfusions are necessary.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

NREM Sleep : Prolactin levels naturally rise during sleep, especially during the deeper stages of NREM sleep, due to reduced dopamine activity, which normally inhibits prolactin secretion. Despite this increase, the levels achieved during sleep are usually not as high as those observed after childbirth, where prolactin plays a direct and significant role in breastfeeding.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. NREM Sleep</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

As the night progresses and sleep deepens, dopamine levels decrease, leading to a decrease in the inhibition of prolactin release. Consequently, prolactin levels rise, reaching their peak in the early morning hours.</li><li>\u27a4 Prolactinoma: The most common cause of hyperprolactinemia is a noncancerous tumour of the pituitary gland called a prolactinoma.</li><li>\u27a4 Prolactinoma:</li><li>\u27a4 Medications: Certain medications can increase prolactin levels.

Small blood vessels are most radioresistant: This is incorrect. Larger vessels are more radioresistant compared to smaller ones.

Small blood vessels are most radioresistant:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Rapidly proliferating cells are most radioresistant: This is incorrect. Rapidly proliferating cells are the most radiosensitive.

Inferior vena cava</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 Inferior vena cava has the highest oxygen concentration in fetal circulation. Fetal heart pumps large quantity of blood into the placenta for exchange of substances. From placenta, the umbilical veins collect the blood, which has more oxygen and nutrients. Umbilical vein passes through liver, some amount of blood is supplied to liver from umbilical vein, large quantity of blood is diverted from umbilical vein into the inferior vena cava through ductus venosus. Liver receives blood from portal vein also. In liver, the oxygenated blood mixes slightly with deoxygenated blood and enters the right atrium via inferior vena cava. From right atrium, major portion of blood is diverted into left atrium via foramen ovale. Foramen ovale is an opening in intra-atrial septum. Blood from upper part of the body enters the right atrium through superior vena cava. From right atrium, blood enters right ventricle. Then, blood is pumped into pulmonary artery. From pulmonary artery, blood enters the systemic aorta through ductus arteriosus. Only a small quantity of blood is supplied to fetal lungs. Blood from left ventricle is pumped into aorta. Fifty percent of blood from aorta reaches the placenta through umbilical arteries.</li><li>\u2022 Inferior vena cava has the highest oxygen concentration in fetal circulation.</li><li>\u2022 Fetal heart pumps large quantity of blood into the placenta for exchange of substances.</li><li>\u2022 From placenta, the umbilical veins collect the blood, which has more oxygen and nutrients.</li><li>\u2022 Umbilical vein passes through liver, some amount of blood is supplied to liver from umbilical vein, large quantity of blood is diverted from umbilical vein into the inferior vena cava through ductus venosus.</li><li>\u2022 Liver receives blood from portal vein also.</li><li>\u2022 In liver, the oxygenated blood mixes slightly with deoxygenated blood and enters the right atrium via inferior vena cava.</li><li>\u2022 From right atrium, major portion of blood is diverted into left atrium via foramen ovale.

It is a special region of premotor cortex situated in inferior frontal gyrus. Area 44 is situated in pars triangularis and 45 in pars opercularis of this gyrus. Broca aphasia is the non-fluent speech problem. It occurs due to lesion in left frontal lobe of cerebral cortex. It is also known as expressive aphasia or anterior aphasia. The affected persons do not complete the sentences because of their inability to construct the sentences.

D) DIEP is a myocutaneous flap</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) flap is a type of breast reconstruction flap that is derived from the deep inferior epigastric artery. The DIEP flap is a muscle-sparing flap, meaning it involves only the removal of skin, fat, and blood vessels (perforators), without taking any of the rectus abdominis muscle. This reduces the risk of post-operative abdominal weakness and complications, unlike the Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous (TRAM) flap, which includes muscle. Therefore, it is incorrect to refer to the DIEP flap as a myocutaneous flap because it does not include muscle.</li><li>\u2022 DIEP is a myocutaneous flap: This statement is false. A myocutaneous flap includes muscle tissue, whereas the DIEP flap spares the rectus abdominis muscle, utilizing only the skin, fat, and perforator vessels.</li><li>\u2022 DIEP is a myocutaneous flap:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Pedicled TRAM based on superior epigastric artery: The pedicled TRAM flap stands for Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap. It relies on the superior epigastric artery for blood supply, which remains attached (pedicled) to its original source. The flap, including the rectus muscle, is tunneled under the skin to the chest to reconstruct the breast. This statement is accurate.</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
