The presence of caput medusae is generally associated with end-stage disease. Caput medusae are identified by the appearance of engorged veins radiating toward the lower limbs. The portal vein is the central connection of these anastomoses.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options: B, C & D.
