      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Atrophic form leads to 90% of the blindness The exudative or wet form of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) usually leads to more serious vision loss and is responsible for 90% of blindness due to this disease. However, the atrophic form is more familiar, with about 90% of patients diagnosed with atrophic ARMD.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>It can present with a diminution of vision, distorted vision, and seeing straight lines as wavy, bent, or fuzzy. There may be shadowed areas in the central visual field, causing difficulty in reading. Macular degeneration does not cause complete blindness as it does not affect peripheral vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B . Zinc supplements and antioxidant vitamins may help to lower the risk for or halt the progression. Option: C . Hereditary factors, age, nutrition, smoking, hypertension, and exposure to sunlight are all risk factors for ARMD. Option: D . Macular degeneration is more common in people older than 65, females, and whites.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Ophthalmoscopically, the dry type is characterized by drusen and loss of pigment in the retina and pigment epithelium.

Retinitis pigmentosa is a slow, degenerative retina disease, mainly occurring in both eyes, beginning in childhood and often resulting in blindness in middle or advanced age. The symptoms are night blindness and concentric contraction of the visual fields leading to tunnel vision. Option: B . Retinal detachment (RD) is characterized by transient flashes of light (photopsia), \u2018floaters\u2019 or a \u2018curtain\u2019 or \u2018veil\u2019 obscuring the field of vision. The patient experiences a fall in visual acuity when the macula becomes detached or a large bullous detachment obstructs the fovea. RD is unlikely since none of these features are present in the vignette. Option: C .
