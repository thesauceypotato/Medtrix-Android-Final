Most of the amblyopic visual loss is reversible if detected and treated at the appropriate time. It affects 1.0 to 5.0% of the general population.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Various treatment modalities have been tried like refractive correction, patching (both full-time and part-time), penalization, and pharmacological therapy. Refractive correction alone improves visual acuity in one-third of patients with anisometropic amblyopia.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - . Spectacles Disadvantages of spectacles . Image is magnified by 30%, so not useful in unilateral aphakia (produces diplopia). The problem of spherical and chromatic aberrations of thick lenses. The field of vision is limited. Prismatic effect of thick glasses. \u2018Roving ring Scotoma\u2019 (Jack in the Box phenomenon). Cosmetic blemishes especially in young aphakic. Contact lenses. Advantages of contact lenses Less magnification of Image. Elimination of aberrations and prismatic effect of thick glasses. Wider and better field of vision. Cosmetically more acceptable. Better suited for uniocular aphakia. Disadvantages of contact lenses are: more cost; cumbersome to wear, especially in old age and childhood; and Corneal complications may be associated. Intraocular lens implantation Primary intraocular lens implantation is done during cataract surgery. Secondary intraocular lens implantation Refractive corneal surgery includes: Keratophakia and Epikeratophakia Hyperopic Lasik may be tried in cases where secondary IOL cannot be implanted</p>\n<p></p>",

Corneal edemas , which can be caused by keratitis, anterior uveitis, acute congestive glaucoma, and certain metabolic disorders (e.g., mucopolysaccharidoses), would appear as opacifications on slit-lamp examination and cause impaired visual acuity. However, such opacifications would not be restricted to the pupillary area, as is the case here. Instead, opacification would be present throughout the cornea and obscure the underlying iris. Option: B. Vitreous body pathologies, such as persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) and chronic ocular toxocariasis, can result in impaired visual acuity and leukocoria. However, PHPV typically occurs during childhood, and toxocariasis is accompanied by ocular pain. Moreover, both conditions are typically unilateral, whereas both eyes are affected in this patient. Option: D. Retinal pathologies such as retinoblastoma, retrolental fibroplasia, and Coats disease can cause leukocoria with impaired visual acuity. However, these conditions typically occur in the pediatric population, not in adults.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Conditions associated with congenital and juvenile cataracts include galactosemia, chromosomal trisomie s, certain TORCH infections (e.g., rubella, toxoplasmosis), Marfan syndrome, Alport syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, and neurofibromatosis type II.</p>\n<p></p>",
