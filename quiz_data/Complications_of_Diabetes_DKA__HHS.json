Upon questioning, he reported unquenchable thirst, and the repeated need to urinate. Although he ate all of his rations as well as whatever he could get from his fellow trainees. On the last day, he complained of vague abdominal pain, which was worse on the morning of admission. He had vomited once. During examination, he was oriented but tachypneic. He appeared pale, dehydrated with dry mucous membranes, and poor skin turgor. His respiratory rate was 36/minute with deep, laborious breathing; his heart rate was 138/minute regular, and his blood pressure was 90/60 Laboratory, on admission, showed glucose of 560 mg/dl, sodium 154, potassium 6. 5, pH 7. 25, bicarbonate 10 mM/liter.
