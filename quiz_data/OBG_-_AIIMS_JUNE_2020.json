Ultrasound scanning is also required during the follow-up to see if the corpus luteum cysts diminish in size and disappear, and to detect persistent mole, invasive mole and choriocarcinoma. The metastasis in the liver can be picked up on an ultrasound Doppler ultrasound shows abnormal vascularization. Serum b-hCG: Serum b-hCG level is very high in a complete mole but is not very much raised in a partial mole. A serum level of more than 40,000 m IU/mL as determined by radioimmunoassay is reported .

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Ulipristal</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Clomiphene is the first drug of choice in the induction of ovulation. By competing with cytoplasmic estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, it blocks the negative feedback of circulating endogenous estrogen . This allows the release of GnRH into the pituitary portal system and stimulates LH and FSH secretion. Starting on the second day of the cycle and given for 5 days, the E2 level starts increasing 5\u20136 days after stopping the drug and induces maturity of the Graafian follicle and ovulation with LH surge. The best action is seen if a certain amount of estrogen is present in the body. However, it exerts anti-E action on the endometrium and cervical mucus , causing a slight decrease in the fertility rate. Letrozole (nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor) is used in the induction of ovulation. It has a half-life of 45 h and is eliminated via the kidneys. It prevents the conversion of androstenedione to oestrone.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options A, C and D can be used for ovulation induction.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Letrozole has the following advantages over clomiphene: It has no anti-estrogenic action on the endometrium and the cervix\u2014which yields a better pregnancy rate. It induces mono-follicular stimulation, adequate LH surge and avoids multiple pregnancies. Better implantation. No hyperstimulation syndrome. It is suited in cases of PCOS. Lately, a single dose of 20 mg on day 3 is being tried. It is contraindicated in hepatic dysfunction. It can however cause drowsiness and liver dysfunction. Laparoscopic ovarian drilling: . In women with PCOD in whom induction of ovulation with a medical line of treatment fails, laparoscopic ovarian drilling of follicles with monopolar cautery/laser has yielded satisfactory results. Ulipristal . It is a synthetic progesterone hormone receptor modular, that attaches to the progesterone receptor and prevents/delays ovulation and suppresses endometrium , preventing implantation. A 30 mg tablet should be taken within 5 days. A two per cent pregnancy rate is reported. Side effects are headaches and mood changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Causes of anovulation suitable and unsuitable for ovulation induction treatment Causes of anovulation suitable for ovulation induction treatment Hypothalamic-pituitary causes Hypothalamic \u25cf       Low concentration of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism) \u25cf       Weight or exercise related amenorrhoea \u25cf       Kallman's syndrome (amenorrhoea with anosmia caused by congenital lack of hypothalamic production of gonadotrophin releasing hormone) \u25cf        Stress \u25cf       Idiopathic Pituitary \u25cf       Hyperprolactinaemia \u25cf       Pituitary failure (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism) \u25cf       Sheehan's syndrome (panhypopituitarism) Hypophysectomy or Craniopharyngioma \u25cf       Cerebral radiotherapy Ovarian causes \u25cf       Polycystic ovaries (commonest cause of anovulatory subfertility) Other endocrine causes \u25cf       Hypothyroidism \u25cf       Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Causes of anovulation not suitable for ovulation induction treatment Ovarian failure causes \u25cf       Idiopathic \u25cf       Chemotherapy or radiotherapy \u25cf       Surgical removal \u25cf       Genetic \u25cf       Autoimmune Chromosomal causes \u25cf       Turner's syndrome (45,X) \u25cf       Androgen insensitivity syndrome (46,XY)</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Studdiford criteria</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Spiegelberg laid down the following criteria to diagnose ovarian pregnancy: Both fallopian tubes must be anatomically normal at laparotomy. The gestational sac must occupy the ovary in-depth , not just be superficially adherent to it. The wall of the gestational sac should consist of recognizable ovarian elements on histological examination. Chorionic tissue should also be identifiable in the ovarian mass The gestational sac should be attached to the uterus by the ovarian ligament and to the pelvic wall by the infundibulopelvic ligament Abdominal pregnancies can be classified as primary (rare) and secondary. Most abdominal pregnancies are the second type. Primary abdominal pregnancy is defined as direct peritoneal implantation of the fertilized ovum and is diagnosed by the Studdiford criteria : (1) normal fallopian tubes and ovaries; (2) absence of a utero peritoneal fistula; and (3) attachment exclusively to a peritoneal surface early enough to eliminate the possibility of a secondary gestation. In contrast, secondary abdominal pregnancy is defined as the reimplantation of a ruptured extrauterine pregnancy , most commonly tubal, in the peritoneal cavity.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The (Rubin, 1983) anatomical and histological criteria for cervical pregnancy include: Cervical gland must be opposite the placental attachment. The placenta attachment to the cervix must be situated below the entrance of the uterine vessels or the peritoneal reflections of the anterior or posterior surface of the uterus. 3. The fetal elements must be absent from the corpus uteri. Rubin's criteria require a hysterectomy specimen to satisfy these criteria. Clinical diagnostic criteria of cervical pregnancy as described by Paalman and McElin (1959) 1. Uterine bleeding without cramping pain following a period of amenorrhea. 2. Soft, enlarged cervix equal to or larger than the fundus, (the \u201chourglass\u201d appearance of uterus). 3. Products of conception entirely confined within and firmly attached endocervix. 4. A closed/snug internal cervical os. 5. A partially opened external os.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Constant care during the second stage reduces the incidence of episiotomy and perineal trauma. \u25cf In elastic (rigid) perineum: causing arrest or delay in the descent of the presenting part as in elderly primigravidae. \u25cf Anticipating perineal tear: (a) Big baby (B) face to pubis delivery (c) breech delivery (d) shoulder dystocia. \u25cf Operative delivery: Forceps delivery, ventouse delivery \u25cf Previous perineal surgery: Pelvic floor repair, perineal reconstructive surgery. Common indications are: (1) Threatened perineal injury in primigravidae (2) Rigid perineum (3) Forceps, breech, occipitoposterior or face delivery. Timing of the episiotomy: The timing of performing the episiotomy requires judgment. If done early, the blood loss will be more. If done late, it fails to prevent the invisible lacerations of the perineal body and thereby fails to protect the pelvic floor- the very purpose of the episiotomy is thus defeated. Bulging thinned perineum during contraction just prior to crowning (when 3-4 cm of the head is visible) is the ideal time. During forceps delivery, it is made after the application of blades. The following are the various types of episiotomy: \u25cf Mediolateral \u25cf Median \u25cf Lateral \u25cf \u2018J\u2019 shaped Mediolateral \u2013 The incision is made downwards and outwards from the midpoint of the fourchette either to the right or left. It is directed diagonally in a straight line which rungs about 2.5cm away from the anus (midpoint between the anus and ischial tuberosity Median \u2013 The incision commences from the centre of the fourchette and extends posteriorly along the midline for about 2.5 cm. Lateral \u2013 The incision starts from about 1 cm away from the centre of the fourchette and extends laterally. It has got many drawbacks including the chance of injury to the Bartholin\u2019s duct. It is totally condemned. \u2018J\u2019 shaped \u2013 the incision begins in the centre of the fourchette and is directed posteriorly along the midline for about 1.5 cm and then directed downwards and outwards along the 5 or 7 o\u2019clock position to avoid the anal sphincter. Opposition is not perfect and the repaired wound tends to be puckered. This is also not done widely. Thus, only mediolateral or median episiotomy is done commonly and as such their relative merits and demerits are given in the tabulated form.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
