It is caused by a failure of neural crest cells to migrate and populate the myenteric and submucosal plexuses of the intestines during embryonic development. Hirschsprung disease is more commonly seen in males than females and is often associated with genetic mutations, including those in the RET proto-oncogene.

It helps evaluate the morphology and characteristics of red blood cells, including signs of abnormal destruction.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A: Phototherapy : Phototherapy is the most common treatment for neonatal jaundice. It involves exposing the baby's skin to special blue or white light, which helps convert unconjugated bilirubin into a form that can be excreted through the urine and stool. The baby would be placed under a phototherapy unit, usually in an open crib with eye protection. The duration of phototherapy depends on the bilirubin level and the baby's response to treatment. Regular monitoring of bilirubin levels is done to assess the effectiveness of phototherapy. OPTION C: Exchange transfusion: Exchange transfusion is an invasive procedure reserved for severe cases of jaundice that do not respond to phototherapy or when the bilirubin levels pose a significant risk to the baby's health. It involves gradually replacing the baby's blood with compatible donor blood, removing the bilirubin-rich blood and replacing it with fresh blood that has lower bilirubin levels. Exchange transfusion carries risks and is performed under the guidance of experienced healthcare professionals in specialized settings. OPTION D: USG abdomen: Ultrasound (USG) abdomen may be ordered to evaluate the structural integrity of the liver, biliary system, and other abdominal organs. It helps identify any anatomical abnormalities or obstructions that could be causing or contributing to jaundice. USG abdomen is typically performed when there are concerns about liver or biliary tract disorders, such as biliary atresia.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

It is characterized by distinct facial features , such as a broad forehead, full cheeks, a wide mouth, and a small upturned nose. Individuals with Williams syndrome often have cardiovascular abnormalities, including supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), which is a narrowing of the blood vessel leading from the heart to the body.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION B: Edward syndrome (Trisomy 18): Edward syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 18. It is characterized by severe developmental and medical abnormalities. Facial features commonly seen in Edward syndrome include a small jaw, low-set ears, clenched fists, and rocker-bottom feet. Cardiac defects, such as ventricular septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus, are frequently present in individuals with Edward syndrome. Other features may include growth restriction, intellectual disability, clenched hands, and organ malformations. OPTION C : Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. Individuals with Down syndrome typically exhibit distinct facial features, such as almond-shaped eyes, a flat nasal bridge, and a protruding tongue. Common cardiac findings in Down syndrome include atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD), ventricular septal defects (VSD), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Individuals with Down syndrome often experience intellectual disability, developmental delays, and characteristic physical features. Other potential features include hypotonia (low muscle tone), short stature, and an increased risk of certain medical conditions, such as leukemia and thyroid disorders. OPTION D: Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13): Patau syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 13. Facial features commonly seen in Patau syndrome include a cleft lip or palate, small eyes (microphthalmia), and a scalp defect (holoprosencephaly). Cardiac defects, such as ventricular septal defects and atrial septal defects, are frequently present in individuals with Patau syndrome. Other features may include polydactyly (extra fingers or toes), central nervous system abnormalities, severe intellectual disability, and organ malformations.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Hypercalcemia , an elevated calcium level in the blood, is also commonly seen in individuals with Williams syndrome.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Type 2 Hyaline membrane disease is now commonly called respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). It is caused by a deficiency of a molecule called surfactant. Hyaline membrane disease arises as a result of surfactant deficiency due to prematurity. Pulmonary surfactant is a mixture of lipids and proteins which is secreted by the epithelial type II cells into the alveolar space. Its main function is to reduce the surface tension at the air/liquid interface in the lung.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Surfactant is primarily secreted by Type 2 pneumocytes in the alveoli of the lungs. Surfactant is a mixture of lipids and proteins that reduces surface tension within the alveoli, preventing them from collapsing during expiration and promoting proper gas exchange. Deficiency or dysfunction of surfactant can lead to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or hyaline membrane disease (HMD) in newborns, where the alveoli become stiff and difficult to inflate.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: Type 1 Pneumocyte Type 1 pneumocytes are involved in the structure of the alveoli and play a crucial role in gas exchange. They form the thin, flat epithelial lining of the alveoli, which allows for efficient diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. While type 1 pneumocytes are not primarily responsible for surfactant secretion, they contribute to the maintenance of the alveolar structure and function. Option C: Both Type 1 & 2 Pneumocyte While type 2 pneumocytes are the primary cells responsible for surfactant secretion, type 1 pneumocytes are involved in the structure and gas exchange capabilities of the alveoli. Together, type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes work in coordination to maintain the alveolar integrity and efficient gas exchange within the lungs. Option D: Dust Cell (Alveolar Macrophage) Dust cells, also known as alveolar macrophages, are immune cells present in the alveoli of the lungs. Their primary function is to engulf and remove foreign particles, pathogens, and debris from the respiratory system. While dust cells contribute to lung defense and maintenance of respiratory health, they do not play a direct role in surfactant secretion.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>HMD typically manifests within the first hours to days of life, with respiratory distress being the hallmark feature. The respiratory distress is characterized by tachypnea, grunting, nasal flaring, retractions, and cyanosis. Chest auscultation may reveal diminished breath sounds, fine inspiratory crackles, or signs of respiratory distress.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Type 1 Pneumocyte Involved in alveolar structure and gas exchange - Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) <br> - Pulmonary fibrosis Type 2 Pneumocyte Primary cells for surfactant secretion - Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in newborns <br> - Interstitial lung diseases Both Type 1 & 2 Type 1 pneumocytes maintain structure, type 2 secrete surfactant - Acute Interstitial Pneumonia (AIP) <br> - Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) Dust Cell (Macrophage) Immune cells that remove foreign particles in alveoli - Pneumoconiosis (e.g., Asbestosis, Silicosis) <br> - Hypersensitivity pneumonitis</p>\n<p></p>",
