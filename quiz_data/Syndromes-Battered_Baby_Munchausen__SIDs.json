These patients appear to be compulsively driven to make their complaints. The person is aware that he/she is acting out an illness, but he cannot stop the act. There is continuity, ranging from exaggerated claims of infirmity to actual self-induced illness.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B & D. MUNCHAUSEN'S SYNDROME BY PROXY: This term is used to describe the actions of one person (usually a mother) who inflicts harm against another person (usually an infant or small child) in an attempt to gain sympathy and attention for both her own and her child's suffering. Option: C. MALINGERING: Malingering or shamming means conscious, planned feigning, or pretending a disease for the sake of gain. Diseases may be feigned for several reasons, such as by soldiers or policemen to avoid their duties, by prisoners to avoid hard work, by businessmen to avoid business contracts, by workmen to claim compensation, by beggars to attract public sympathy, by criminals to avoid legal responsibility, etc. The diseases that may be feigned are many, e.g., dyspepsia, intestinal colic, ulcers, spitting of blood, diabetes, rheumatism, and neurasthenia, aphasia, sciatica, pain in the back, blindness, deafness, vertigo, epilepsy, insanity, paralysis of the limbs, burns, artificial bruises, etc. Patients can distort or exaggerate their symptoms but true simulation is very rare: The patient may injure his nasopharynx with a sharp instrument, swallow the blood, and regurgitate it in front of the doctor to mimic hematemesis. A skillful puncturing of the anal or vaginal mucosa may produce bleeding. Excessive intake of digitalis may simulate a heart condition. Eating a large amount of carrots will produce carotenemia and may simulate jaundice. Chronic ingestion of coumarin will induce a hemorrhagic diathesis. In many cases detection is easy, but in some cases it is difficult. The history of the case should be taken from the person himself and his relatives or friend, and any inconsistencies in his description of the symptoms noted. Usually, the signs and symptoms do not conform to any known disease. Malingering can be diagnosed by keeping the patient under observation and watching him without his knowledge. A complete examination is essential after removing the bandages if any and washing the part. Rarely an anesthetic may be given to detect malingering.</p>\n<p></p>",

Features: Incidence: 0.6 per thousand live births. Age: 2 weeks to 2 years, but most deaths take place between one and 7 months, with a peak at 2 to 4 months. Sex: There is a slight increase in males. Twins: There is an increased risk (threefold) amongst members of a twin pair. Most twins are premature and of low birth weight. Geographical distribution: The occurrence is worldwide. Time of death: Death always occurs during sleep at all times of night with a moderate increase in the early morning hours. Prematurity has a higher risk. The socio-economic standard of the family is usually low. Cigarette smoking and drug abuse by pregnant women increase the risk. The child is either quite well when put to bed, or may have only a minor upper respiratory tract infection (cold or snuffles), or minor gastrointestinal disturbance. Cot deaths are a major cause of death in infants in the first six months of life.</p>\n<p></p>",

All three stages of labour are merged into one. The Foetus is normal or premature. It is possible in multiparous with the large roomy pelvis but is extremely rare in primiparae. (Option B) It is highly improbable that any primiparous woman would be delivered during ordinary sleep without being aroused. Sometimes, a woman may not be able to distinguish the sense of fullness produced by the descent of a child from the feeling of bulky evacuation. The child may die from Suffocation by falling into a lavatory pan, Head injury and fracture of the skull with subdural haemorrhage often bilateral, by a fall on a hard floor, If the woman was standing, and Haemorrhage from the torn end of the cord. Option: C. If the birth occurs in the toilet bowl or into a bucket containing liquid, the infant will inhale the liquid and blood, and meconium and vaginal mucus are found in the air-passages. Microscopic examination of the lungs will show the foreign particles contained in the drowning fluid. In accidental falls, the hemorrhage is usually subdural and often bilateral. The length of the cord is 50 cm which does not allow the child to fall to the ground and is sufficiently strong to withstand the weight of the Fetus without breaking. The cord is torn most commonly at the foetal end than the placental end but is not torn in its middle or the placenta is expelled with the child. Option: D. Caput succedaneum and moulding of the head are absent. The fractures of the skull are usually fissured and limited to parietal bones but may extend to the frontal and the squamous part of temporal bones. Fractures due to forceps lie at points normally gripped by the instrument and are usually \"gutter\" or \"pond\" type</p>\n<p></p>",
