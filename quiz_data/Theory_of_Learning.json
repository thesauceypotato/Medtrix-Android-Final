If the rat jumps the hurdle between the compartments within the five-second interval between buzzer onset and shock, the buzzer is turned off and shock is avoided. What is the type of learning explained in the about said scenario?",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Avoidance learning It is a type of learning where a noxious stimulus is avoided by the response . A warning signal is before the aversive stimulus.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect Options:- Option B: Escape learning is an example of instrumental conditioning based on negative reinforcement. There is no warning signal before the aversive stimulus. Option C: In Classic conditioning/Pavlov's conditioning , a neutral stimulus regularly precedes an unconditioned stimulus that evokes an unconditioned response as a result of this pairing the previously neutral conditioned stimulus now begins to evoke a response. For example, an adolescent who was terrorized by an attack by a group of students near a school then develops an extremely negative physiological reaction each time he or she is near the school. Option D: Operant conditioning occurs when a child learns to avoid traumatic reminders to prevent distressing feelings from arising. For example, if a child was in a motor vehicle accident, the child may then refuse to ride in cars altogether to prevent negative physiological reactions and fear from occurring.</p>\n<p></p>",
