      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Cochlear Aqueduct As we know, the cochlear aqueduct (Aqueduct of Cochlea) is a connection between scala tympani (containing perilymph) and the subarachnoid space (containing CSF). On occasions, particularly in young children, the Cochlear aqueduct is large and open. Infection can spread to the inner ear from the infected CSF or vice versa, via the cochlear aqueduct resulting in severe profound hearing loss (meningitic labyrinthitis).</p>\n<p></p>",

Now he has nominal aphasia which occurs in temporal lobe abscess which is an intracranial complication of Otitis media.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Nominal aphasi- If the abscess involves the dominant hemisphere, i.e. left hemisphere in right-handed persons, the patient fails to tell the names of common objects such as keys, pens, etc. but can demonstrate their use. Homonymous hemianopia - This is due to pressure on the optic radiations. The visual field, opposite to the side of the lesion, is lost. Contralateral motor paralysi- In the usual upward spread of abscess, the face is involved first followed by the arm and leg. Inward spread, towards the internal capsule, involves the leg first followed by the arm and the face. Epileptic fits - Involvement of uncinate gyrus causes hallucinations of taste, and smell and involuntary smacking movements of lips and tongue. Generalized fits may occur.</p>\n<p></p>",
