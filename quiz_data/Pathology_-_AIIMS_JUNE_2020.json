G6PD deficiency is a recessive X-linked trait, placing males at much higher risk for symptomatic disease . G6PD mutations cause protein misfolding and breakdown , making it easier for red blood cells to break . As red blood cells age , the G6PD variants become less effective at protecting against oxidative stress , making older cells more likely to break than younger ones. The episodic hemolysis that is characteristic of G6PD deficiency is caused by exposures that generate oxidant stress. The most common triggers are infections, drugs implicated are numerous, including antimalarials (e.g., primaquine and chloroquine), sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin , and others. The most frequently cited food is the fava bean, which generates oxidants when metabolized called \u201cFavism\u201d . When G6PD deficient RBCs are exposed to high levels of oxidants , reactive sulfhydryl groups on globin chains cross-link and form Heinz bodies , and dark inclusions are seen in stained red blood cells. These Heinz bodies can damage the red blood cell membrane and cause intravascular hemolysis or reduced red blood cell flexibility . As the damaged cells pass through the spleen , macrophages remove the Heinz bodies , resulting in some cells retaining a \u2018bitten\u2019 appearance or becoming spherocytes due to loss of membrane surface area . Both types of damaged cells are then removed by phagocytes. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: effects of oxidant drug exposure (peripheral blood smear). Inset, Red cells with precipitates of denatured globin (Heinz bodies) revealed by supravital staining. As the splenic macrophages pluck out these inclusions, \"bite cells\" like the one in this smear are produced. (Courtesy Dr. Robert W. McKenna, Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, Tex.) Osmotic fragility: Shift to right: Hereditary Spherocytosis Autoimmune Hemolytic anemia Shift to left: Sickle cell anemia Thalassemia Iron deficiency anemia In hereditary spherocytosis , the cells are spherocytic in normal plasma and hemolyze more readily than normal cells in hypotonic sodium chloride solutions. Abnormal spherocytes are also trapped and destroyed in the spleen, meaning that hereditary spherocytosis is one of the most common causes of hereditary hemolytic anemia . The spherocytosis is caused by mutations in proteins that make up the membrane skeleton of the erythrocyte, which normally maintain the shape and flexibility of the red cell membrane, including spectrin , the transmembrane protein band 3 , and the linker protein, ankyrin . Red cells can also be lysed by drugs (especially penicillin and sulfa drugs) and infections. The susceptibility of red cells to hemolysis by these agents is increased by deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which catalyzes the initial step in the oxidation of glucose via the HMP pathway. This pathway generates NADPH , which is needed for the maintenance of normal red cell fragility . Severe G6PD deficiency also inhibits the killing of bacteria by granulocytes and predisposes to severe infections. Therefore, the only true option is hemolysis in hypotonic saline .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: Mutated spectrin. False , seen in hereditary spherocytosis. In Hereditary spherocytosis mutations involving \u03b1-spectrin, \u03b2-spectrin, ankyrin, band 4.2, or band 3 weaken the interactions between proteins and cause red cells to lose membrane fragments as they age. To accommodate the resultant change in the ratio of surface area to volume, these cells adopt a spherical shape . Option B: Spherical in shape. False , seen in hereditary spherocytosis. In Hereditary spherocytosis mutations involving \u03b1-spectrin, \u03b2-spectrin, ankyrin, band 4.2, or band 3 weaken the interactions between proteins and cause red cells to lose membrane fragments as they age. To accommodate the resultant change in the ratio of surface area to volume, these cells adopt a spherical shape . Option C: Resist hemolysis in Hypotonic saline. False .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The sigmoid shape of the normal osmotic fragility curve indicates that normal red cells vary in their resistance to hypotonic solutions . Indeed, this resistance varies gradually (osmotically) as a function of red cell age, with the youngest cells being the most resistant and the oldest cells being the most fragile . The reason for this is that old cells have a higher sodium content and a decreased capacity to pump out sodium.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Total number of times a cell can divide in their lifetime Hayflick\u2019s Phenomenon The Hayflick limit , or Hayflick phenomenon , is the number of times a normal somatic, differentiated human cell population will divide before cell division stops . However, this limit does NOT apply to stem cells . Leonard Hayflick demonstrated that a normal human fetal cell population will divide between 40 and 60 times in cell culture before entering a senescence phase . Each time a cell undergoes mitosis , the telomeres on the ends of each chromosome shorten slightly . Cell division will cease once telomeres shorten to a critical length . Telomeres are repeat sequences of DNA at the end of linear chromosomes that shorten by around 50\u2013200 base pairs during each cell division by mitosis. Once telomeres become too short, cell division can no longer occur. This mechanism contributes to the Hayflick limit and has been called the cellular clock . In an individual cell, critically short telomere length triggers the p53 pathway , usually leading to proliferative arrest, senescence, and apoptosis . Telomere loss is the molecular basis for the \u201cHayflick phenomenon,\u201d the limit to cell division and thus to cell proliferation in tissue culture.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Telomere attrition in ageing: One mechanism of replicative senescence involves the progressive shortening of telomeres , which ultimately results in cell cycle arrest . When somatic cells replicate , a small section of the telomere is not duplicated and telomeres become progressively shortened . As the telomeres become shorter, the ends of chromosomes cannot be protected and are seen as broken DNA, which signals cell cycle arrest. Telomere length is maintained by nucleotide addition mediated by an enzyme called telomerase . Telomerase is RNA-dependant DNA polymerase which adds DNA to the 3\u2019 end of the chromosome to avoid loss of genetic material with every duplication. They are present only in Eukaryotes. Telomerase activity is decreased in ageing and Progeria. Telomerase activity is increased in Cancer and progenitor cells.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B: Total number of times a cell can divide in a year.

Apoptotic sensors inhibit the anti-apoptotic factors like BCL 1,2,6 BCL-XL MCL-1 which inhibit apoptosis by inhibiting the release of CYTOCHROME-C into the cytosol . Once released into the cytosol, Cytochrome-C binds to a protein called APAF-1 (apoptosis-activating factor-1), forming a multimeric structure called the apoptosome . This complex binds to Caspase-9 , the critical initiator caspase of the mitochondrial pathway, and promotes its autocatalytic cleavage , generating catalytically active forms of the enzyme, which activates endonuclease and protein breakdown to form apoptotic bodies from the dying cell.

During development, totipotent stem cells can give rise to the full range of differentiated tissues; in the mature organism, adult stem cells only have the capacity to replace damaged cells and maintain cell populations within the tissues where they reside. Adult stem cells have a limited repertoire (lineage potential) of differentiated cells that they can generate. Thus although adult stem cells can maintain tissues with high (e.g., skin, and gastrointestinal tract) or low (e.g., endothelial) cell turnover, the adult stem cells in any given tissue can usually produce only those cells normally found within that tissue. Hematopoietic stem cells continuously replenish all the cellular elements of the blood as they exit the circulation, senesce, or are otherwise consumed. They can be isolated directly from bone marrow, as well as from the peripheral blood after administration of certain colony-stimulating factors that induce their release from bone marrow niches. Although they are overall rare, hematopoietic stem cells can be purified to virtual purity based on cell surface markers. Clinically, these stem cells can be used to repopulate marrows depleted after chemotherapy (e.g., for leukemia) or to provide normal precursors to correct various blood cell defects (e.g., sickle cell disease).

Complications of massive transfusion include the following: Coagulopathy is caused by a dilutional effect on the host's clotting factors and platelets, as well as the lack of platelets and clotting factors in packed red blood cells. Volume overload Hypothermia Hyperkalemia may be caused by lysis of stored red cells and is increased in irradiated red blood cells. Metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia may be caused by the transfusion of a large amount of citrated cells. Hypocalcemia due to citrate toxicity (as Citrate chelates Calcium) may occur in those with hepatic failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), or other low-output states. It is increasingly uncommon with the use of component therapy. Transient hypotension may be noted among transfused patients who take angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors . Since blood products contain bradykinin that is normally degraded by ACE, patients on ACE inhibitors may have increased bradykinin levels that cause hypotension in the recipient. The blood pressure typically returns to normal without intervention . Metabolic Acidosis may occur in patients with liver failure .
