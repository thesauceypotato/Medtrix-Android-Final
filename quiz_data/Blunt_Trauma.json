The lens may show the following changes: Vossius ring. It is a circular ring of brown pigment seen on the anterior capsule.

It occurs mainly due to the imbibition of aqueous and partly due to the direct mechanical effects of the injury on lens fibres. lt may assume any of the following shapes: \u2022 Discrete subepithelial opacities are of most common occurrence. Early rosette cataract(punctate). It is the most typical form of concussion cataract. It appears as feathery lines of opacities along the star-shaped suture lines; usually in the posterior cortex. Late rosette cataract. It develops in the posterior cortex l to 2 years after the injury. Its sutural extensions are shorter and more compact than the early rosette cataract. Traumatic zonular cataract. It may also occur in some cases, though rarely. Diffuse (total) concussion cataract. It is of frequent occurrence. Early maturation of senile cataracts may follow blunt trauma. Traumatic absorption of the lens. Subluxation of the lens Dislocation of the lens.

Sickle cell trait or disease, in and of itself, is not a risk factor for corneal blood staining , but in these patients, blood clots may linger in the anterior chamber longer and cause high pressures. In cases of large hyphema, lowering IOP and removal or evacuation of the blood clot from the anterior chamber may be needed to prevent this complication.
