The typical incubation period for leprosy is 2 to 12 years. It frequently manifests as a visible skin lesion, such as a hypopigmented or erythematous macule, or as a numb spot on the skin . The face, buttocks, trunk, and extensor aspects of the limbs are frequently affected by lesions . Skin, cutaneous, and peripheral nerves , as well as mucous membranes , are all impacted . The Ulnar nerve followed by the posterior tibial nerve , median and lateral popliteal nerves , are the peripheral nerves that are most frequently affected . The facial nerve is the cranial nerve that is involved most frequently. Both nerve function and hair growth are compromised by the lesions .
