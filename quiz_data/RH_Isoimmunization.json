      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Tissue anoxemia and metabolic alkalosis seen The given clinical scenario points towards Rh isoimmunization pregnancy with Hydrops fetalis . The image shows a stillborn edematous infant due to hydrops fetalis. HYDROPS FETALIS: Excessive destruction of the fetal red cells leads to severe anaemia, tissue anoxemia and metabolic acidosis . These have got adverse effects on the fetal heart and brain and the placenta. Hyperplasia of the placental tissue occurs to increase the transfer of oxygen but the available fetal red cells (oxygen-carrying cells) are progressively diminished due to hemolysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>ABO incompatibility: If ABO is present along with Rh incompatibility it protects against Rh isoimmunization. ABO blood group compatibility of mother and fetus - ABO incompatibility protects against Rh isoimmunisation. When ABO-incompatible fetal red cells enter the mother's bloodstream, they quickly combine with the naturally occurring anti-A and anti-B agglutinins and are neutralised by sequestration in the liver. On the other hand, ABO-compatible fetal red cells will persist in the mother's circulation and thus stimulate the immune response.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. This is the most serious form of Rh hemolytic disease (HDFN). Option: C. As a result of fetal anoxemia, there is damage to the liver leading to hypoproteinemia which is responsible for generalized edema (hydrops fetalis), ascites and hydrothorax. Hemolysis caused by the Rh incompatibility, causes extramedullary hematopoiesis in the fetal liver and bone marrow . The push to make more erythroblasts to help compensate for the hemolysis overworks the liver causing hepatomegaly. The resulting liver dysfunction decreases albumin output which in turn decreases oncotic pressure. Consequentially, the decrease in pressure results in overall peripheral edema and ascites. Option: D. Fetal death occurs sooner or later due to cardiac failure. The baby is either stillborn or macerated and even if born alive, dies soon after.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>\"Hydrops is characterized by excess fluid in two or more body areas such as thorax, abdomen or skin.

Thereafter, they are removed from circulation by the reticuloendothelial tissues and are broken down with the liberation of the antigen. The antibody production is related not only to the responsiveness of the reticuloendothelial system but also to the amount of Rh antigen liberated, therefore to the number of red cells that have entered the maternal blood. Because this takes a long time, immunization in a first pregnancy is unlikely. Detectable antibodies usually develop after 6 months following a larger volume of fetomaternal bleed. But, if the fetomaternal bleed is less than 0.1 mL, the antibody may not be detected until boosted by further Rh stimulus. Antibodies once formed remain throughout life.</p>\n<p></p>",
