      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Chlamydia Given scenario is a classic case of Chlamydial infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Infected women frequently transmit C. trachomatis infection to their infants during birth. Vaginal delivery is the usual route of transmission of C. trachomatis from infected mother to infant, as the eyes are coated with chlamydia as the baby passes down the birth canal. Approximately 50-70% of infants born to women with genital chlamydia infection will acquire chlamydia infection if no prophylaxis is given before or immediately after birth . Maternally-acquired infection with C. trachomatis is the commonest cause of neonatal conjunctivitis in industrially developed countries and it is a significant cause of this condition in the developing world . Conjunctivitis develops between 5-14 days after delivery, usually in one eye but affecting the other after 2-7 days. Oedema and erythema of the eyelids is common, along with an eye discharge that may be watery initially, but becoming purulent later. Although chlamydia conjunctivitis is usually mild, infection of the hair follicles will increase the amount of discharge and prolong the period of infection. The most serious complication of neonatal chlamydia infection is pneumonia caused by nasopharyngeal C. trachomatis infection or aspiration of infected genital secretions during delivery.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Pneumonia, affecting as many as 10-20 percent of all infected infants, typically occurs at around six weeks of age. These babies generally have a low-grade fever with an increased respiratory rate. Often a persistent cough interferes with feeding. A chest X-ray will show hyperinflation and diffuse infiltrates. Pneumonia in pre-term babies is more serious, presenting initially with respiratory distress followed by worsening respiratory signs and apnoea. If left untreated, infants are at increased risk of developing chronic pulmonary disease, including asthma.</p>\n<p></p>",

Babies might pull their legs up to their chest. A baby might also vomit several times or have blood in the stool, or could appear weak or very irritable. These signs would usually happen during the first week after the first or second dose of rotavirus vaccine, but look for them any time after vaccination.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Intussusception and Rotavirus Vaccine: Rotavirus Vaccine: Intussusception is a rare but known complication associated with the rotavirus vaccine. This complication occurs when a portion of the intestine folds into another, leading to a blockage. Frequency : The risk of intussusception after rotavirus vaccination is very low, occurring in about 1 in 20,000 to 100,000 vaccinated infants. Specific Vaccines : Two rotavirus vaccines have been associated with intussusception: RotaTeq : It is a pentavalent human-bovine reassortant vaccine. Rotarix : It is a monovalent attenuated human rotavirus vaccine. Age at Risk: The increased risk of intussusception is seen primarily within the first week after the first and second doses of the rotavirus vaccine.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A. Measles Vaccine: The measles vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine and is not associated with intussusception. OPTION B. Polio Vaccine: Both the oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) are not known to cause intussusception. OPTION D. Oral Typhoid Vaccine: The oral typhoid vaccine (Ty21a) is not associated with intussusception.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Benefits Outweigh Risks : Despite this rare risk, the benefits of rotavirus vaccination in preventing severe diarrhea and dehydration far outweigh the small risk of intussusception. Monitoring and Recommendations : Both vaccines have undergone thorough safety evaluations, and their use is recommended by major health organizations. Monitoring for adverse events, including intussusception, continues post-licensure.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Increased indirect bilirubin, increased urobilinogen, absent bilirubin in urine Physiological jaundice occurs due to increased bilirubin production and limitation of bilirubin conjugation in the neonates. This leads to increase in indirect/unconjugated bilirubin Increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood leads to increased production of urobilinogen (present in urine in large amounts) Urine bilirubin is not found in this condition Physiological jaundice first appears on 2 nd or 3 rd day, usually peaks between 4 th and 5 th day at 5 \u2013 6mg/dL, and decreases to < 2mg/dL between 5 th and 7 th day after birth; though it is considered physiological even if it persists till 2 weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>PHYSIOLOGICAL JAUNDICE CRITERIA: Appears between 24-72 hours ( never in 1st 24 hours) Peaks by D3in term and D3-7 in preterms and then declines Serum bilirubin < 15 mg/dl In physiological jaundice, the following findings are observed: Increased Indirect Bilirubin : Physiological jaundice is characterized by an increase in indirect bilirubin (unconjugated bilirubin) due to the immature liver function in newborns, leading to difficulty in processing bilirubin efficiently. Increased Urobilinogen: Urobilinogen is increased in the urine during physiological jaundice. It results from the increased breakdown of bilirubin in the gut and higher levels of urobilinogen excretion. Absent Bilirubin in Urine: Unconjugated bilirubin (indirect bilirubin) is not water-soluble and cannot be excreted in the urine. Therefore, bilirubin is absent in the urine in cases of physiological jaundice.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The combination of increased indirect bilirubin and increased urobilinogen in the absence of bilirubin in the urine is characteristic of physiological jaundice in newborns. It is a common and usually benign condition that resolves on its own without treatment within a few days to weeks after birth.</p>\n<p></p>",
