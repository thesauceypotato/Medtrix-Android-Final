It measures the forward distance between the lateral orbital rim and apex of cornea, with the eye looking straight ahead. Normal values vary between 10 and 21 mm and are symmetrical in both eyes. Difference of more than 2 mm between the two eyes is considered significant. The simplest instrument to measure proptosis is Luedde's exophthalmometer However Hertel's exophthalmometer is the most commonly used instrumen Its advantage is that it measures the two eyes simultaneously.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - OPTION: A,C,D- All these conditions cannot be measured by this instrument.</p>\n<p></p>",

Step 1- -1D spherical would mean a power of -1D on vertical and horizontal axis. Step 2- -2D cylindrical at 180 degree mean , power of -2D at 90 degree(perpendicular to 180) So total power in vertical meridian will be = -1-2= -3D Total power in horizontal meridian will be = -1D Hence vertical meridian (-3D) is greater than horizontal meridian (-1D), it will be with the rule astigmatism.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>TYPES OF REGULAR ASTIGMATISM With-the-rule astigmatism (WTR) -  In this type the two principal meridians are placed at right angles to one another but the vertical meridian is more curved than the horizontal.

As it may cause astigmatism due to radial incision & thinning of the cornea leading to corneal perforation at the site of incision.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>RADIAL KERATOTOMY Radial keratotomy (RK) refers to making deep (90% of corneal thickness) radial incisions in the peripheral part of cornea leaving the central 4 mm optical zone. These incisions on healing; flatten the central cornea thereby reducing its refractive power. This procedure gives good correction in low to moderate myopia (2 to 6 D). However, because of its disadvantages and advent of safe techniques ( LASIK and PRK ) RK is not recommended presently. DISADVANTAGES OF RK Cornea is weakened, so chances of globe rupture following trauma are more  after RK than after PRK. This point is particularly important for patients who are at high risk of blunt trauma, e.g. sports persons, athletes and military personnel. Rarely, uneven healing may lead to irregular astigmatism. Patients may feel glare at night.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - OPTION: B- PRK is photorefractive keratectomy which corrects myopia by using excimer laser. It is safer than RK and it can correct upto -6D of myopia. OPTION: C- LASIK is Laser assisted in situ keratomileusis and it is the most commonly done surgery for myopia. It is much safer and in it excimer laser reshapes the cornea by ablating the superficial stroma to a predetermined extent after lifting a flap of the cornea with a sharp microkeratome. OPTION: D- SMILE is small incision lenticule extraction and in it a lenticule of corneal stroma is extracted using femtosecond laser. It can correct myopia upto 10D.</p>\n<p></p>",
