The manufacturing of the lipids and fat molecules specially elongation and desaturation of fatty acids take place in the smooth ER. Desaturation occurs in liver ER.

Though ER is not directly involved in protein still they help in proper folding and some post-translational modifications of newly synthesized proteins. Option: C.

Absence of Peroxisomes in almost all tissues, peroxisomes are responsible for the oxidation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) which contain more than 22 carbons. So, accumulation of VLCFA (C > 22) occurs especially in the brain, as brain sphingomyelins are rich in long-chain fatty acids.

Glucose and Lactic acid Glucose and lactic acid metabolism occur in the cytoplasm and do not involve peroxisomes. Hence, they will be metabolized normally. Option: D. TG Here TG refers to stored adipose tissue TG. Peroxisomes are involved in \u03b1-oxidation for branched-chain amino acid and oxidation of VLCFA. As adipose tissue TG generally does not contain either of these two types of FA, so the metabolism of TG will not be affected.</p>\n<p></p>",
