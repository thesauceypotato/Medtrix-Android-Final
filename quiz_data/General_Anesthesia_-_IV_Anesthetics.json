Option: Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) as the name suggests, means only using IV agents, and is often employed for small-duration daycare surgeries. Ketamine because of its analgesic properties is utilized as a sole agent for select situations like burn dressings, pericardiocentesis, or incision, and drainage of the abscess.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>There may occur delayed respiratory depression with fentanyl Opioids are very frequently used through the epidural route to achieve post-op analgesia. They are deposited in epidural space while receptors are present in the spinal cord so, they have to cross the meninges to reach the spinal cord. Fentanyl has got high lipid solubility, therefore, crosses the meninges fast and that\u2019s why does not accumulate in CSF to cause respiratory depression</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. After IV injection, all pure agonists are sequestered by the stomach. Reabsorption from the stomach can lead to the recurrence of respiratory depression. This is also called biphasic respiratory depression; 1 st phase of depression is due to IV injection and 2 nd phase is after absorption from the stomach. Recurrence of respiratory depression is only exhibited by pure agonists Option: B. Pentazocine is a mixed opioid therefore, will not exhibit recurrence or biphasic respiratory depression. Option: C. Due to low lipid solubility, morphine crosses the meninges slowly and gets retained in CSF to ascend to inhibit medullary centers leading to respiratory depression after 6-12 hours</p>\n<p></p>",
