      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Turners syndrome TURNER'S SYNDROME: It is the most common sex chromosome abnormality of human females. Its incidence in the newborn is about 1 in 2500. In this condition, the anatomical structure is female, but the nuclear sexing is male. It can be recognized at birth by edema of the dorsum of the hands and feet, loose skin folds in the nape of the neck, low birth weight, and short stature. It is characterized by primary amenorrhoea, sterility, lack of development of primary and secondary sexual characteristics, increased urinary gonadotrophin excretion, pigmented naevi, a short fourth metatarsal, webbed-neck, shield chest, wide-set nipples, high-arched palate, low-set ears, slow growth, learning problems, spina bifida, coarctation of the aorta, septal defects, renal defects.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. True Hermaphroditism: This is a very rare condition of bisexuality in which an ovary and a testicle or two ovotestes are present with the external genitalia of both sexes. The gonad may be abdominal, inguinal or labio-scrotal in position. There may be a Phallus may be penile or clitoral; the labia may be bifid as in female or fused resembling the scrotum of the male. Neither gonad is completely functional. The somatic sex chromatin may be male or female Option: B. Pseudohermaphroditism: In this condition, gonadal tissue of only one sex is seen internally, but the external appearance is of the opposite sex. (A)Male pseudohermaphroditism: Nuclear sex is XY, but sex organs and sexual characteristics deviate to the female form, because of testicular feminization. It is characterized by primary amenorrhoea, female external genitalia, normal size breasts, and scanty or absent axillary and pubic hair. Testes are in the abdomen or inguinal canal; 5-a reductase deficiency occurs. (B) Female pseudohermaphroditism: Nuclear sex is XX, but the deviation of sex organs and sexual characters towards males are seen, due to adrenal hyperplasia. 21 hydroxylase deficiency is the most common. Option: C. KLINEFELTER'S SYNDROME:- In this condition, the anatomical structure is male, but the nuclear sexing is female. The sex chromosome pattern is XXY (47 chromosomes). It is usually diagnosed when there is a delay in the onset of puberty, behavioral disorders and mental retardation. Axillary and pubic hair are absent, and hair on the chest and chin are reduced. Gynaecomastia, azoospermia, low levels of testosterone, sterility, increased urinary gonadotrophins, signs of eunuchoidism, and increased height are common. Testicular atrophy with hyalinization of seminiferous tubules is seen histologically. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (defective development of testes or ovaries and excess pituitary gonadotropin secretion) is seen.</p>\n<p></p>",
