Venous ulcers are characteristically difficult to heal; however, persistence may indicate that there is another or coexisting cause (e.g., malignancy, rheumatoid arthritis or arterial ischaemia). Biopsies are indicated if malignancy is suspected and it is important to remember that a Marjolin\u2019s type of ulcer (a squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma) can develop in a chronic long-standing venous ulcer.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Marjolin Ulcer : When an SCC appears in a scar it is known as a Marjolin\u2019s ulcer In chronic wounds, such as pressure sores, burns or osteomyelitis , the chronicity of the inflammatory environment can lead to the development of a Marjolin ulcer. This is a rare but aggressive form of squamous cell carcinoma that has a high propensity for distant metastasis. A low index of suspicion must be observed in chronic wounds that undergo sudden phenotypic change, so an early biopsy is advocated.</p>\n<p></p>",

High-grade malignant tumours are usually present as rapidly growing, often painless swellings in and around the parotid gland. The tumour presents as either a discrete mass with infiltration into the overlying skin or a diffuse but hard swelling of the gland with no discrete mass.

This sequence comprises an isolated cleft palate, retrognathia and a posteriorly displaced tongue (glossoptosis), which is associated with early respiratory and feeding difficulties. Isolated cleft palate is more commonly associated with a syndrome than cleft lip/palate and cleft lip alone. Over 150 named syndromes are associated with cleft lip and palate, although Stickler (ophthalmic and musculoskeletal abnormalities), DiGeorge (cardiac/thymic anomalies), Down, Apert and Treacher Collins syndromes are most frequently encountered</p>\n<p></p>",

The track of the descent of the thyroid gland is variable, passing in front, through or behind the eventual position of the hyoid body. Thyroglossal duct cysts represent the persistence of this track and may therefore be found anywhere in or adjacent to the midline from the tongue base to the thyroid isthmus. Rarely, a thyroglossal cyst may contain the only functioning thyroid tissue in the body . Clinical Features: The cysts almost always arise in the midline but, when they are adjacent to the thyroid cartilage, they may lie slightly to one side of the midline. Classically, the cyst moves upwards on swallowing and with tongue protrusion , but this can also occur with other midline cysts such as dermoid cysts, as it merely indicates attachment to the hyoid bone. Treatment must include excision of the whole thyroglossal tract , which involves the removal of the body of the hyoid bone and the suprahyoid tract through the tongue base to the vallecula at the site of the primitive foramen caecum, together with a core of tissue on either side. This operation is known as Sistrunk\u2019s operation.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Thoracic Outlet Syndrome The thoracic outlet is a narrow space at the base of the neck bounded by the first rib medially, scalenus anterior muscle & clavicle anteriorly, and scalenus medius muscle posteriorly. All elements of the brachial plexus as well as the subclavian artery and vein pass through this narrow space and can be potentially compressed at this site. A Roos test is performed by asking the patient to hold both arms overhead in a surrender position while opening and closing the fists. This reproduces symptoms within 1 minute and, if continued, the arm collapses at the side. Adson test involves palpating the radial pulse while the patient turns the chin toward the same side, inhales deeply, and holds his or her breath. The radial pulse disappears or diminishes. Treatment is primarily nonoperative, involving posture-improving exercises and avoidance of aggravating activities. If symptoms persist, especially if they are associated with vascular compression, the thoracic outlet may be surgically decompressed. This is accomplished by a transcervical or trans-axillary resection of the first rib, often with the release of the scalene muscles.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B: Subclavian steal syndrome may occur if the first part of the subclavian artery is occluded Option C: Neurogenic TOS needs to be confirmed with nerve conduction studies to localize the area of slowing of nerve conduction and to rule out other compression syndromes, such as carpal tunnel syndrome</p>\n<p></p>",
