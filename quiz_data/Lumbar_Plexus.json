      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Femoral The femoral nerve supplies the extensors at the knee joint and skin over the anterior aspect of the thigh. Injury of the femur is uncommon but may be injured by a stab, gunshot wounds, during hip operations or a pelvic fracture leading to Motor loss Poor flexion at the hip joint because of paralysis of the iliacus and sartorius muscles. Inability to extend the knee because of paralysis of the quadriceps femoris. Sensory loss Over the anterior and medial aspects of the thigh. Over the medial side of the leg and foot up to the back of the great toe.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. Obturator The obturator nerve arises from the lumbar plexus and provides sensory and motor innervation to the thigh. The obturator nerve : Provides motor innervation to the medial compartment of the thigh It is essential to the adduction of the thigh. Provides sensory innervation to the medial upper thigh and articular branches to the hip and knee. Option C. Common peroneal The common peroneal nerve is the smaller and terminal branch of the sciatic nerve, composed of the posterior divisions of L4, 5, S1, and 2. It passes forwards around the neck of the fibula within the substance of fibularis (peroneus) longus, where it terminates by dividing into the superficial and deep fibular (peroneal) nerves. Common peroneal nerve gives : The Genicular branches of the knee joint The Lateral cutaneous nerve of the calf A Sural communicating branch. The two terminal branches include Superficial peroneal nerve Deep peroneal nerve The superficial peroneal nerve supplies the leg's lateral (peroneal) compartment muscles . In addition, it supplies the skin over the lateral lower two-thirds of the leg and the whole of the dorsum of the foot except for the area between the 1st and 2nd toes, which is supplied by the deep peroneal nerve. The deep peroneal nerve runs with the anterior tibial vessels over the interosseous membrane into the anterior compartment of the leg and then over the ankle to the dorsum of the foot. It supplies the anterior compartment's muscles and provides a cutaneous supply to the area between the 1st and 2nd toes. Option D. Tibial The tibial nerve is the larger terminal branch of the two main muscular branches of the sciatic nerve. The tibial nerve provides innervation to the lower leg and foot muscles. Specifically: triceps surae (the two-headed gastrocnemius and soleus), plantaris, Popliteus, tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus. It also has articular and cutaneous branches.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>At the foot level, the tibial nerve divides into the medial plantar nerve (MPN) and the lateral plantar nerve (LPN). The MPN supplies muscular branches to the big toe and the two toes next to it, and the LPN the other two toes. The sural nerve is a cutaneous branch of the tibial nerve that supplies the skin of the legs and feet.</p>\n<p></p>",

It has many modifications, and one of them is the saphenous opening that is present on the medial side of the thigh . It is guarded by the cribriform fascia that is perforated by numerous structures. Cribriform fascia is pierced by numerous structures, such as the great saphenous vein before it drains into the femoral vein, the superficial epigastric and superficial external pudendal vessels, and a few lymph vessels containing superficial and deep inguinal lymph nodes. The superficial circumflex femoral artery is a branch of the femoral artery that supplies the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the region below the inguinal ligament.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Femoral Hernia The image is a case of a femoral hernia. It occurs when adipose tissue or a part of the intestine pokes through into your groin at the top of the medial side of the thigh. It pushes through a weak part along the abdominal wall into the femoral canal.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Femoral hernia is a type of indirect hernia . The hernia content passes through the femoral canal and the saphenous opening to poke the upper medial side of the thigh or lower abdomen . The saphenous opening is a modification of the fascia lata. Hence, it is the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Pyomyositis is a rare bacterial infection of the skeletal muscle. It is caused by the Staphylococcus aureus The signs and symptoms include pain and tenderness of the affected muscle, fever, and abscess formation. The muscle involved here is the tensor fascia lata. Hence, it is often accompanied by arthritis of the hip joint (this muscle is attached to the iliotibial tract attached to the hip capsule). The bacteria can travel through the bloodstream and can affect other skeletal muscles of the body. Hence, it is the wrong answer. Option: C. I nguinal hernia is of both direct and indirect types. It occurs along the pubic region and passes along the inguinal canal . Hence, it is the wrong answer. Option: D. Neurofibroma is a nerve tumour that forms soft bumps on or under the skin. It can develop within a major or minor nerve anywhere in the body. It is not related to the fascia lata. Hence, it is the wrong answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Common hernias in female location</p>\n<p></p>",
