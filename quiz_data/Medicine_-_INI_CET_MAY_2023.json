If there is a lesion in the left hemisphere, there is not much contralesional neglect because the right hemisphere can compensate for both sides. The left hemisphere directs attention only in the contralateral right hemispace. If there is a lesion in the right hemisphere, it leads to severe contralesional hemineglect because the left hemisphere does not contain ipsilateral attention functions. Patients with neglect may not be able to dress or groom the left side of the body. They may fail to copy the details on the left side of a drawing. Two bedside tests can be used to evaluate neglect: In simultaneous bilateral stimulation, when the examiner provides unilateral or simultaneous bilateral stimulation in the visual, auditory, or tactile modalities, patients have no difficulty detecting unilateral stimuli on either side but perceive the bilaterally presented stimulus as coming only from one side. This phenomenon is known as extinction.

Left posterior inferior cortex : Location: Posterior Inferior Cortex (Cerebellum) Function: The cerebellum is responsible for coordinating voluntary movements, maintaining balance and posture, fine-tuning motor skills, and supporting some cognitive functions. Effects of Lesion: A lesion in the posterior inferior cortex (cerebellum) can lead to a range of motor-related and cognitive deficits, depending on the specific area affected. Possible Symptoms: Motor Coordination Issues: Difficulties in coordinating movements, resulting in unsteady gait, tremors, and jerky movements. Balance Problems: Impaired ability to maintain balance and posture, leading to falls or unsteady movements. Dysmetria: Overreaching or underreaching of movements due to disrupted coordination. Dysarthria: Speech difficulties characterized by slurred or unclear speech. Nystagmus: Involuntary eye movements, often causing visual disturbances. Cognitive Changes: Some cognitive functions such as executive functions (planning, decision-making) may be affected, but the cerebellum\u2019s exact role in cognition is still being researched. Option B. Left motor cortex : Location: Left Motor Cortex Function: Controls voluntary movements on the right side of the body Effects of Lesion: A lesion in the left motor cortex can lead to various motor-related deficits primarily affecting the right side of the body. This is because the brain\u2019s wiring causes the left motor cortex to control movements on the right side and vice versa.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>GAMMA -GT The best marker for alcohol induced liver damage is GAMMA-GT</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>GGT \u0130s commonly used in patients with alcoholic liver disease as a marker of excessive alcohol intake. GGT \u0130s present in many tissues, including the kidneys, pancreas, and liver. It is mainly derived from the liver and this is often used as a marker of hepatobiliary diseases. Chronic alcohol consumption leads to the induction of hepatic microsomal GGT which leads to a rise in GGT in alcoholics. Laboratory investigations in patients with alcohol-induced liver dysfunction: AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) elevations that do not exceed 400 |U/L. AST/ALT ratio of >1.5. Serum bilirubin >3 mg/dL</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option A. SGOT: Elevated SGOT/AST Levels: When the liver is damaged due to alcohol consumption, such as in conditions like alcoholic hepatitis or alcoholic liver disease, SGOT/AST levels can become elevated. However, elevated SGOT/AST levels are not solely specific to alcohol-induced liver damage and can also occur in other liver diseases, viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and other conditions. An SGOT/SGPT ratio greater than 2 is highly suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Option B. SGPT: Elevated SGPT/ALT Levels: Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to inflammation and damage to liver cells. This can result in elevated SGPT/ALT levels as liver cells release the enzyme into the bloodstream. While elevated SGPT/ALT levels can be seen in alcohol-related liver damage, it\u2019s important to note that ALT elevation can also occur in other liver diseases, such as viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), druginduced liver injury, and more. An SGOT/SGPT ratio greater than 2 is highly suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. It occurs in 70% of these patients compared with 26% of patients with postnecrotic cirrhosis, 8% with chronic hepatitis, 4% with viral hepatitis and none with obstructive jaundice. Option D. Total billirubin: Elevated Bilirubin Levels: Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to inflammation and damage to liver cells. When the liver is unable to process bilirubin effectively due to this damage, it can lead to an increase in bilirubin levels in the bloodstream. Elevated bilirubin levels may manifest as jaundice, where the skin and whites of the eyes take on a yellowish color However, elevated bilirubin levels can also occur in other liver conditions, such as viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, bile duct obstruction, and other forms of liver disease. Total bilirubin levels may be elevated in infectious hepatitis. Bilirubin levels higher than 30 mg/dL indicate more severe disease.</p>\n<p></p>",
