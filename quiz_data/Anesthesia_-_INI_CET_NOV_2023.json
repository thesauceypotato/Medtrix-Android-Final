      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Severe systemic disease Severe systemic disease best fits into grade 3 of the ASA classification. Grade III is also sometimes called as MODERATE SYSTEMIC ILLNESS WITH LIMITATION OF FUNCTION . American Society of Anesthesiologists classification is used to define relative risk prior to conscious sedation and surgical anesthesia . It is strongly correlates to perioperative risk . ASA Classification Definition of Patient  Status Examples ASA I ASA II ASA III ASA IV ASA V Normal health. Mild systemic disease. Severe systemic disease. Severe systemic disease that is constant threat to life. Moribund, not expected to survive without operation Healthy, non-smoking, no alcohol use. Current smoker, well-controlled DM and HTN Poorly controlled DM or HTN Recent MI, CVA, TIA, or CAD/stents Ruptured abdominal, thoracic aneurysm, massive trauma, intracranial bleed with mass effect ASA indicates American Society of Anesthesiology.</p>\n<p></p>",
