This blue curve represents the summation of the transmural pressures of the isolated chest wall and lungs at a given volume. When these pressures are precisely equal and opposing, the chest wall-lung unit is at equilibrium and, as seen, this occurs at the Functional Residual Capacity. Expansion of the lung-chest wall unit beyond the FRC requires positive transmural pressures, meaning that left alone the unit would collapse, yielding exhalation. Contraction of the lung-chest wall unit below the FRC requires negative transmural pressures, meaning that left alone the unit would expand, yielding spontaneous inhalation.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Medium size airways According to the Weibel Airway classification, there are 23 generations. The maximum airway resistance is shown by medium size airways.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Since they have a lesser radius as compared tothe According to Poiseuille-Hegan law; resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius of airways. The greatest amount of resistance to airflow occurs not in the tiny air passages of the terminal bronchioles but in some of the larger bronchioles and bronchi near the trachea. The reason for this high resistance is that there are relatively few of these larger bronchi in comparison with the approximately 65,000 parallel terminal bronchioles, through each of which only a minute amount of air must pass. So only option C is correct, the rest are false.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option B. First generation: Trachea - low resistance due to large diameter.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The airways in the respiratory system progressively divide into smaller and smaller branches, resulting in an increase in total cross-sectional area and a decrease in airway resistance. The order of airway generations and the corresponding level of airway resistance can be summarized as follows: First generation: Trachea - low resistance due to large diameter Second to fourth generation: Bronchi - low resistance due to large diameter and branching structure Fifth to sixteenth generation: Bronchioles - moderate resistance due to smaller diameter Seventeen to twenty-third generation: Terminal bronchioles - high resistance due to smallest diameter and the greatest number of airways.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Respiratory Tree Conducting Zone:- Large airways consist of the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and\n     bronchi. Airway resistance is highest in the large- to medium-sized bronchi. Small airways consist of bronchioles that further divide into\n     terminal bronchioles (large numbers in parallel least airway resistance). Warms, humidifies, and filters air but does not participate in gas\n     exchange\u201canatomic dead space.\u201d Cartilage and goblet cells extend to the end of the bronchi.\n     Pseudostratified ciliated columnar cells primarily make up the epithelium of the bronchus and extend to\n     the beginning of terminal bronchioles, then transition to cuboidal cells.\n     Clear mucus and debris from the lungs (mucociliary escalator). Airway smooth muscle cells extend to\n     the end of terminal bronchioles (sparse beyond this point). 2. Respiratory\nZone:- Lung parenchyma consists of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar\n     ducts, and alveoli. Participates in gas exchange. Mostly cuboidal cells in respiratory bronchioles, then simple\n     squamous cells up to alveoli.  Cilia terminate in respiratory\n     bronchioles. Alveolar macrophages clear debris and participate in the immune response.</p>\n<p></p>",
