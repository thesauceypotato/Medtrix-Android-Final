It is responsible for delayed allergic reactions and the rejection of transplants of foreign tissue.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Cytotoxic T cells attack and destroy cells that have the antigen which activates them. They kill by inserting perforins and by initiating apoptosis. Delayed-reaction allergy is caused by activated T cells and not by antibodies. At the same time, these T cells elicit a cell-mediated type of immune reaction. Cellular immunity constitutes a major defense against infections due to viruses, fungi, and a few bacteria such as the tubercle bacillus.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Options: A, C, and D.

In one of these, the body develops circulating antibodies, which are globulin molecules in the blood plasma capable of attacking the invading agent. This type of immunity is called humoral immunity or B-cell immunity (because B lymphocytes produce the antibodies). The second type of acquired immunity is achieved the through formation of large numbers of activated T lymphocytes that are specifically crafted in the lymph nodes to destroy the foreign agent. This type of immunity is called cell-mediated immunity or T-cell immunity (because the activated lymphocytes are T lymphocytes).</p>\n<p></p>",
