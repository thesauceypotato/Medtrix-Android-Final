Most infections are bacterial (bacterial endocarditis). Acute IE is typically caused by infection of a previously normal heart valve by a highly virulent organism (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) that rapidly produces destructive lesions. These infections may be difficult to cure with antibiotics alone and often require surgery ; despite appropriate treatment, there can be substantial morbidity and even mortality. Subacute IE is characterized by organisms with lower virulence (e.g., viridans streptococci) that cause insidious infections of deformed valves with overall less destruction. In such cases, the disease may pursue a protracted course of weeks to months, and cures can often be achieved with antibiotics alone. Endocarditis of native but previously damaged or otherwise abnormal valves is caused most commonly (50% to 60% of cases) by Streptococcus viridans , a normal component of the oral cavity flora. In contrast, more virulent aureus organisms commonly found on the skin can infect either healthy or deformed valves and are responsible for 20% to 30% of cases overall; notably, S. aureus is the major offender in IE among intravenous drug abusers . Prosthetic valve endocarditis occurring in the 1 to 2 months after surgical implantation is typically caused by skin flora ( aureus and S. epidermidis ), and prosthetic valve infections 1 year or more after surgery tend to be streptococci and S. aureus .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Subacute IE is caused by organisms with lower virulence (e.g., viridans streptococci). Correct . Option: B. Acute endocarditis is a necrotizing and ulcerative, invasive valvular infection on a previously normal valve. Correct . Option: D. Prosthetic valve endocarditis can be caused by S. epidermidis. Correct .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In about 10% of all cases of endocarditis, no organism can be isolated from the blood ( \u201cculture-negative\u201d endocarditis ); reasons include prior antibiotic therapy , difficulties in isolating the offending agent , or because deeply embedded organisms within the enlarging vegetation are not released into the blood</p>\n<p></p>",

The aortic and mitral valves are the most common sites of infection , although the valves of the right heart may also be involved, particularly in intravenous drug abusers . Vegetations can be single or multiple and may involve more than one valve ; they can occasionally erode into the underlying myocardium and produce an abscess ( ring abscess ). Vegetations are prone to embolization ; because the embolic fragments often contain virulent organisms, abscesses frequently develop where they lodge , leading to sequelae such as septic infarcts or mycotic aneurysms .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.

Microscopically, the vegetations of subacute IE typically exhibit granulation tissue at their bases indicative of healing.
