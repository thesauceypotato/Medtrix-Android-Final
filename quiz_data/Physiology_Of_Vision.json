An example of this type of lesion would be a pituitary tumor that compresses the optic chiasm. A lesion in an optic nerve will result in blindness in the ipsilateral eye, and a lesion in an optic tract will result in homonymous hemianopia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>When there is compression at the optic chiasm, the visual impulse from both nasal retinas are affected, leading to the inability to view the temporal, or peripheral, vision. This phenomenon is known as bitemporal hemianopsia. In the optic chiasm, ganglion cell axons from the nasal half of each retina cross and merge with uncrossed axons from the temporal retina of the contralateral eye so that each optic tract carries information exclusively from the contralateral visual field.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Lesions at different locations along the visual pathway produce characteristic visual deficits. For example, the section of one optic nerve produces complete ipsilateral anopia. A section through the optic chiasm produces heteronymous hemianopia, with loss of vision from the temporal half of each retina. Section of one optic tract produces homonymous hemianopia, with loss of vision from the temporal half of one retina and the nasal half of the other.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Visual\n  field defects 1.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The ciliary body Contracting the ciliary body increases the refractive power of the eye for near vision. The ciliary body is a ring-shaped structure located in the eye, just behind the iris. It is responsible for controlling the shape of the lens, which is necessary for focusing on near objects. The ciliary body contracts during the near vision, which causes the suspensory ligaments to relax and the lens to become more spherical, increasing its refractive power.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hyperopia : In some individuals, the eyeball is shorter than normal, and the parallel rays of light are brought to focus behind the retina. This abnormality is called hyperopia or farsightedness. Corrected by Convex lens Myopia : In myopia (nearsightedness), the anteroposterior diameter of the eyeball is too long and the image is focused in front of the retina. This is corrected by a concave lens. Presbyopia : Gradual loss of accommodation due to age-related decrease in elasticity of the lens. Both near vision and far vision are affected. Bifocal lenses are used in treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A: The Iris: The muscles of the iris control the size of the pupils Option C: The suspensory ligaments: When the ciliary muscle contracts, it pulls the suspensory ligaments toward the cornea, which causes the lens surface to bulge, increasing its refractive power.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Transformation of 11-cis retinal to all-trans retinal The light-sensitive chemical in the retinal rods is called rhodopsin. It is a combination of 11-cis retinal and opsin.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The first step in the process is the absorption of light by a pigment called rhodopsin, which is located in the outer segment of the rod cells. Rhodopsin consists of a protein called scotopsin and a derivative of vitamin A called 11-cis retinal. When light is absorbed, 11-cis retinal is isomerized to the all-trans-retinal, which triggers a conformational change in scotopsin, leading to the activation of a signaling cascade that ultimately results in the generation of the electrical signal.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Rest options are incorrect</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Avitaminosis A, or vitamin A deficiency, can cause a reduction in the amount of 11-cis retinal available for the formation of rhodopsin, which can impair the ability of the rod cells to respond to light and lead to night blindness (nyctalopia). Therefore, ensuring adequate vitamin A intake is important for the maintenance of normal visual function. Functions of Vitamin A 1- Vision Vitamin A is a component of the visual pigments of rod and cone cells. Rhodopsin, the visual pigment of the rod cells in the retina, (for vision in dim light) consists of 11-cis retinal specially bound to the protein opsin . When rhodopsin is exposed to light, a series of photochemical isomerization occurs, which results in release of all trans retinal and opsin (with bleaching of the visual pigment). This process triggers a nerve impulse that is transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain. Regeneration of rhodopsin requires isomerization of all trans retinal back to 11-cis retinal, which spontaneously combines with opsin to form rhodopsin.</p>\n<p></p>",
