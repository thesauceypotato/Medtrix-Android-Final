Incidence : Ureterocoeles affect females more often than males (4:1) and 10% are bilateral. Presentation & Diagnosis : In childhood, they usually present with infection. When large, they can obstruct the bladder neck or even the contralateral ureteric orifice. In adults, ureterocoeles typically present with stones in the lower ureter. The classic sign of a ureterocoele on excretion urography was of a \u2018cobra head\u2019 but intravenous urography (IVU) is relatively infrequently undertaken nowadays. On cystoscopy, a bulging, translucent swelling involving the ureteric orifice is typical which fills with and empties of urine with ureteric peristalsis. Treatment Treatment of simple ureterocoeles is surgical excision with re-implantation of the ureter. The endoscopic incision is a relatively straightforward method of releasing a stone stuck in a ureterocoele but may result in subsequent ureteric reflux. A non-functioning kidney may need a nephrectomy.</p>\n<p></p>",

For the primary tumour surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment , with the traditional view that a 2 cm margin of normal tissue be removed being superseded by a more recent, more conservative view, such that penile preserving surgery with excision of much lower margins of normal tissue are now accepted. Tumours affecting the glans penis require glansectomy , with more advanced tumours requiring partial penectomy . In advanced cases, total penectomy is required with the formation of perineal urethrostomy . Such surgery is indicated even in advanced metastatic disease for reasons of local control. Treatment of any associated enlarged inguinal lymph nodes should be delayed until at least 3 weeks after local treatment of the primary lesion. Enlargement caused by infection will usually show signs of subsiding with antibiotic treatment. For palpable nodes, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration will confirm the diagnosis and a block dissection of both groins should be undertaken. The management of patients where the nodes are not palpable disease involves the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) followed by inguinal node dissection if the SLNB is positive. Management of the pelvic nodes is controversial. When they are involved in CT scanning, surgery probably has a little role, but when the iliac nodes are not enlarged in the presence of N2 disease, the options are observation, pelvic lymphadenectomy or radiotherapy. Chemotherapy is relatively ineffective and currently is reserved for palliation in those with metastatic disease.

The latter results in palpable plaques that can be identified on examination. The plaques may rarely be calcified. The presence of these relatively inelastic plaques causes the erect penis to bend, often dramatically, towards the side of the plaque. The commonest direction of deformity is dorsally (towards the abdomen) and the deformity may be so great as to prevent penetrative sexual intercourse.

The presentation varies according to the severity of the obstruction. The more severe the obstruction, the earlier the presentation. Diagnosis is most commonly made antenatally with ultrasound, which demonstrates bilateral hydronephrosis above a distended bladder. Rarely the valves are incomplete and the patient is symptom-free until adolescence or adulthood when again urinary infection or renal impairment can supervene. The investigation will involve a voiding cystogram, with the dilatation of the urethra above the valves demonstrable on a voiding cystogram. The bladder is hypertrophied and often shows diverticula. Typically, there is vesicoureteric reflux into dilated upper tracts. The valves themselves can be difficult to see on urethroscopy because the flow of irrigant sweeps them into the open position. Renal function is usually impaired, albeit to a varying degree, and the extent is further assessed by measurement of ultrasound scanning, which will assess the renal cortical thickness, and renography to assess differential renal function.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Options: A, B & C.
