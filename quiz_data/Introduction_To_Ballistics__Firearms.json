      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Intermediate-range Intermediate-Range (2 to 4 metres): The minimal distance at which shot mass begins to spread is extremely variable. It may be one metre with a sawed-off shotgun but is usually about two metres with the cylinder bore guns and four metres with full choke guns. At a distance of two metres, the shot mass begins to spread and individual pellet holes may be detected, which are usually round and show a rim of abrasion at their margins. The wound of entry is irregular. Beyond two metres the wads often strike the body below the shotgun wound. It may penetrate the skin or it may only bruise the skin. The wads found within the wounds are useful to determine the bore of the gun. At a distance of three metres: Occasionally, several individual pellet entrance wounds are in contact producing scalloped defects which are larger than the individual pellet holes. As lead is soft, pellets deform easily due to friction as they rub against the inside of the barrel. The heat can cause melting and fusion of pellets.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Point blank range The term 'point blank' is used when the range is very close to or in contact with the surface of the skin. The entrance wound is circular with inverted edges, but the rebounding gases may level up or even evert the margins. The skin is burnt with the singeing of the hair. The skin surrounding the wound is hyperaemic and shows some bruising, burning, blackening and tattooing. Option: B. Close range: Tissues surrounding the wound are singed by flame, blackened by smoke, and tattooed by unburnt or partially burnt powder granules. If the powder is smokeless, there may be greyish or white deposits on the skin around the wound. The deposit of smoke is known as smudging, fouling or blackening. This spreads more widely than powder tattooing. The blackening can be removed with a wet cloth. Unburnt particles of the powder are embedded in the skin producing tattooing (stippling or peppering). The particles sticking to the epidermis or lodging in the epidermis superficially can be removed with pressure wiping, showing punctate wounds. Option: C. Distant range The entrance wound is smaller than the missile due to the elasticity of the skin, circular, and the margins are inverted. Distant entrance wounds of the palms and soles are irregular, often having a stellate appearance, without an abrasion ring, and look like exit wounds. Burning, blackening and tattooing are not seen</p>\n<p></p>",

The wad is made of some soft material like felt, cork, plastic, straw or rug. The cardboard disc behind the shot charge prevents the pellets from getting lodged in the felt wad, separates the propellant from the projectiles, seals the bore effectively and prevents the escape of gas from the breech end. Some wads are disc-shaped, others cup-shaped and still, others have bizarre shapes. Certain modern modifications that may be seen in the imported weapons include the increased use of plastic especially to replace traditional wads. Some of these may be \u2018power pistons\u2019 where the shot mass is contained inside the polythene cup, which may also be responsible for producing injuries. In some modern cartridges, plastic granules may be used as filler between the lead pellets, and this highly coloured material may also be found within the wound or upon the skin.</p>\n<p></p>",
