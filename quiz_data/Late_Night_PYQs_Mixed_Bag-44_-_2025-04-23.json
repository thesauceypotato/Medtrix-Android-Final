This is done to quickly restore the uterus to its normal position and reduce the risk of continued bleeding and shock.</li><li>\u2022 After manually repositioning the uterus, the healthcare provider should maintain the position by keeping a fist inside the uterus and administering uterotonic agents such as oxytocin to promote uterine contractions, which help to keep the uterus in place and reduce bleeding.
