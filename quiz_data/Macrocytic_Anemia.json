The daily requirement of cobalamin is 1-3 ug Body stores are 2-3mg, sufficient for 3-4 years if supply is cut off. The absorption of cobalamin in the diet is as follows Haptocorrin(R Factor) is released in saliva and binds to B12 in the stomach after the action of acid on it. The R factor B12 complex reaches the second part of the duodenum. The complex splits with the help of pancreatic enzymes in the second part of the duodenum. B12 binds with intrinsic factors in the second and third parts of the duodenum. (Intrinsic Factor- it is released from parietal cells or oxyntic cells present in the body and fundus of the stomach.) Intrinsic factor vit B12 complex reaches the ileum and binds to cubilin receptors on ileal cells The cobalamin-IF complex enters the ileal cell, where IF is destroyed. After a delay of about 6 h, the cobalamin appears in portal blood attached to transcobalamin (TC) II. note-Transcobalmin II is synthesized predominantly in the liver. Cubilin also is present in the yolk sac and renal proximal tubular epithelium. Cubilin receptor mutation can be associated with proteinuria.
