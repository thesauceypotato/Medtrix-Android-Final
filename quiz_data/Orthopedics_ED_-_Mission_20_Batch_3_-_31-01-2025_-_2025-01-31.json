      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. A) Tension band wiring</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation: Compression plating is a surgical technique used in the internal fixation of fractures. It involves the use of a specially designed plate and screws to stabilize fractured bone segments by applying compression across the fracture site.</li><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Procedure: During compression plating, the plate is applied to the surface of the bone, typically on the tension side of the fracture. Screws are inserted through the plate and into the bone to hold the fractured fragments in alignment. The screws can be tightened to compress the fracture fragments together, promoting healing.</li><li>\u2022 Procedure:</li><li>\u2022 Indications: Compression plating is suitable for fractures where stable fixation is required, especially in cases of comminuted fractures or fractures in load-bearing bones.</li><li>\u2022 Indications:</li><li>\u2022 Advantages: Provides rigid fixation, allows early mobilization and weight-bearing, promotes direct bone healing, and reduces the risk of malunion or nonunion.</li><li>\u2022 Advantages:</li><li>\u2022 Considerations: Careful preoperative planning is necessary to determine the appropriate plate size and screw placement. Postoperative rehabilitation may involve physical therapy to restore strength and function.</li><li>\u2022 Considerations:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Internal fixation:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Internal fixation:</li><li>\u2022 Explanation: Internal fixation refers to the surgical technique of stabilizing fractured bones using implants such as plates, screws, rods, or nails that are placed inside the body. Procedure: The choice of implant depends on the location and type of fracture. Plates and screws are commonly used for fractures near the surface of bones, while rods or nails are used for long bone fractures such as femoral or tibial fractures. Indications: Internal fixation is indicated for fractures that cannot be adequately stabilized with external methods (like casting) alone. It provides immediate stability to fractured bones, allowing for early mobilization and faster healing. Advantages: Provides rigid stabilization, allows for early mobilization and rehabilitation, reduces the risk of malunion or nonunion, and promotes faster recovery. Considerations: Potential complications include implant failure, infection, and damage to surrounding tissues during surgery. Careful surgical technique and postoperative monitoring are essential to minimize risks.</li><li>\u2022 Explanation: Internal fixation refers to the surgical technique of stabilizing fractured bones using implants such as plates, screws, rods, or nails that are placed inside the body.</li><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Procedure: The choice of implant depends on the location and type of fracture.

K-wire fixation:</li><li>\u2022 Explanation: K-wire fixation involves the use of stainless steel wires (Kirschner wires or K-wires) to stabilize fractures or hold bone fragments in place. Procedure: K-wires are inserted percutaneously (through the skin) and across the fracture site or bone fragments. They can be used alone or in combination with other fixation methods such as casting or external fixation. Indications: K-wires are commonly used for simple fractures, temporary fixation, or in cases where other fixation methods are not suitable or necessary. Advantages: Minimally invasive, quick and easy to insert, cost-effective, and useful for maintaining alignment in certain types of fractures. Considerations: K-wires provide less stability compared to plates or screws and are usually temporary. They may need to be removed once the fracture has healed sufficiently, and there is a risk of pin tract infection or migration.</li><li>\u2022 Explanation: K-wire fixation involves the use of stainless steel wires (Kirschner wires or K-wires) to stabilize fractures or hold bone fragments in place.</li><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Procedure: K-wires are inserted percutaneously (through the skin) and across the fracture site or bone fragments.

Distal femur fracture: Distal femur fractures in children can have various fracture patterns, including supracondylar fractures, or fractures of any pattern from the Salter-Harris classification. Salter-Harris II fractures of the distal femur are the most common pattern in children. Even though distal femur fractures are relatively uncommon injuries, they can have significant implications for limb alignment and future growth. Distal femur fractures in children are typically related to trauma, such as falls, motor vehicle accidents, or contact sports. Patients have pain, swelling about the knee, deformity, and an inability to bear weight on the affected leg. Closed manipulation and casting is an option in displaced fractures, although they have significant potential for instability, which could lead to malunion. Internal fixation is the most commonly chosen treatments.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
