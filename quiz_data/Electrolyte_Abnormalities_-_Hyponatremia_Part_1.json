Examples are Glucocorticoid deficiency Hypothyroidism SIADH Hypovolemic hyponatremia - The total body water and sodium content are decreased and the relative decrease in total body sodium is greater than the decrease in total body water. Examples are Osmotic diuresis, Cerebral salt wasting syndrome GI losses -vomiting, diarrhoea Diuretic excess Hypervolemic hyponatremia - when sodium stores increase inappropriately along with an increase in total body water. Examples are a) Renal causes such as acute or chronic renal failure (when dysfunctional kidneys are unable to excrete the ingested sodium) (It also may occur in response to states of decreased effective intravascular volume) Pseudohyponatremia is an uncommonly encountered laboratory abnormality defined by a spuriously low serum sodium concentration of less than 135 mEq/L in the setting of normal serum osmolality. The finding is an artefact that results from the way a blood sample is processed for serum sodium measurement.
