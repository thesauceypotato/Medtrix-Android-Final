The metanephric mesoderm forms the nephrons in the kidney, including Bowman's capsule, the proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, and distal convoluted tubule. Nephrons are formed throughout prenatal development. Option: B. Renal glomeruli are small capillary bundles that form in association with the Bowman capsule. They are not derived from either the ureteric bud or the metanephric mesoderm. Option: C. The urinary bladder is derived from the cloaca. The cloaca divides into a urogenital sinus and an anal canal, which are located anterior and posterior, respectively. The urogenital sinus subsequently differentiates into the urinary bladder and urethra.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Lateral & cephalad to upper pole ureter The ureter from the upper pole of the kidney (the longer ureter) inserts more medially and caudally in the bladder than the ureter from the lower pole (Weigert\u2013Meyer rule). Duplex ureters: In 1 in 125 individuals, two ureters drain the renal pelvis on one side; this is termed a duplex system. Bilateral duplex ureters occur in approximately 1 in 800 cases. Duplex ureters are the product of two ureteric buds arising from the mesonephric duct; they share a single fascial sheath and may either fuse at any point along their course, or remain separate until they insert through separate ureteric orifices into the bladder. Care must be taken not to compromise the blood supply of the second ureter when exercising or reimplanting a single ureter of a duplex. This reflects the embryological development of the ureter: the ureteric bud that is initially more proximal on the mesonephric duct has a shorter time to be pulled cranially in the bladder and so it inserts more distally in the mature bladder. The ureter from the lower pole has a shorter intramural course than the longer ureter and is prone to reflux.</p>\n<p></p>",
