The fall in 2, 3 DPG is less</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 The fall in 2, 3 DPG is less when the blood is stored in CPDA compared with ACD.</li><li>\u2022 The ease with which hemoglobin releases oxygen to the tissues is controlled by erythrocytic 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) such that an increase in the concentration of 2,3-DPG decreases oxygen affinity and vice versa.</li><li>\u2022 In stored blood, the 2,3 DPG levels usually fall, thus less oxygen is released to the tissues. Therefore, its use in hypoxic patients (E.g., anemia) is limited.</li><li>\u2022 Phosphate-containing solution like CPDA (Citrate, phosphate, dextrose, adenine) prevents the fall in 2.3DPG levels. Higher 2,3 DPG concentration decreases affinity of Hb to the oxygen releasing oxygen to the tissues.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Decreased release of O2 : Incorrect. The goal of effective blood storage solutions like CPDA is to ensure that the oxygen release capacity is maintained, not decreased. CPDA helps maintain higher levels of 2,3-DPG, which enhances the release of oxygen to tissues.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Decreased release of O2</li><li>\u2022 Option C. It has less P50 : Incorrect. P50 is a measure of the oxygen tension at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated with oxygen. A higher P50, indicative of lower oxygen affinity, is preferable in stored blood as it means oxygen is more readily released to tissues\u2014a trait supported by higher 2,3-DPG levels.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. It has less P50</li><li>\u2022 Option D. It is less acidic : Incorrect. While pH maintenance is important in blood storage, the primary benefit of CPDA over ACD is not related to less acidity but to its inclusion of phosphate and adenine, which help sustain energy (ATP) production and 2,3-DPG levels in red blood cells.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. It is less acidic</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The use of CPDA in blood storage is superior to ACD due to its phosphate content, which helps maintain higher levels of 2,3-DPG in stored red blood cells. This biochemical preservation is crucial for ensuring that transfused blood can effectively release oxygen to hypoxic tissues, making CPDA the preferred choice in clinical settings where blood transfusions are necessary.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

This principle is critical in explaining the Chloride Shift, also known as the Hamburger phenomenon, which occurs in red blood cells. During the Chloride Shift, bicarbonate ions (HCO3\u2212) generated from the conversion of carbon dioxide to carbonic acid move out of red blood cells into the plasma. To maintain electrical neutrality, chloride ions (Cl\u2212) move from the plasma into the red blood cells.

Normal mature lungs have an L/S ratio \u2265 2:1, indicating higher levels of lecithin (DPPC) compared to sphingomyelin.

As the major determinants of the anionic charge of the GBM, heparan sulfate chains have been thought to impart charge selectivity to the glomerular filtration. It prevents filtration by repelling negatively charged proteins.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Fibronectin : While fibronectin is involved in cell adhesion and matrix assembly, it does not primarily contribute to the charge-dependent filtration properties of the GBM.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Fibronectin</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Collagen Type IV : This type of collagen forms a structural scaffolding in the GBM, providing mechanical strength and stability rather than charge-based selectivity.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Collagen Type IV</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Entactin : Also known as nidogen, entactin helps link the network of laminin and collagen IV in the GBM but does not directly influence charge-based filtration.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Entactin</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Heparan sulfate is the critical component responsible for the charge-dependent filtration in the glomerular basement membrane. Its negative charge effectively repels similarly charged molecules, preventing their passage into the urine, which is essential for the body's ability to retain vital proteins and other negatively charged substances.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
