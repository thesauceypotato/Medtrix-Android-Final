      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Attachment of ATP to the head When ATP binds to the myosin head, it leads to the detachment of the myosin head from actin.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>During muscle contraction, the myosin heads bind to actin filaments and form cross-bridges. The cross-bridge cycle involves a series of events where myosin heads undergo conformational changes to generate force and movement. The cycle begins with the binding of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to the myosin head after it has performed its power stroke and released ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). As per the sliding filament theory at the end of the power stroke during the muscle contraction, ATP binds to  exposed site, and causes a detachment from the actin filament.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Options A, C, and D are not directly involved in the detachment of myosin head from actin: Option: A. Change in troponin C configuration: Troponin C is part of the troponin complex associated with actin filaments. It binds calcium ions during muscle activation and triggers the movement of tropomyosin, exposing the myosin-binding sites on actin. While it is an essential step in the muscle contraction process, it is not directly responsible for the detachment of the myosin head from actin. Option: C. Binding of ADP and IP to head: ADP and Pi are released from the myosin head during the power stroke, allowing the myosin head to generate force and move the actin filament. After the power stroke, ATP binds to the myosin head, leading to its detachment from actin, but the presence of ADP and Pi alone does not cause detachment. Option: D. Pumping Ca2+ into sarcoplasmic reticulum: The pumping of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum is a part of the muscle relaxation process, not directly related to the detachment of myosin head from actin. Muscle relaxation occurs when calcium ions are actively transported back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, reducing the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm and allowing troponin-tropomyosin complex to block the myosin-binding sites on actin, leading to the cessation of cross-bridge formation.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation_images": [],
      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Blocking K+ channels on presynaptic membrane When K+ (potassium) channels on the presynaptic membrane are blocked, it leads to membrane depolarization. Normally, after an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, it triggers the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ (calcium) channels. The entry of Ca2+ into the presynaptic terminal is essential for the release of neurotransmitters, including ACh, into the synaptic cleft.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Blocking voltage gated K++ channels on presynaptic membrane makes K+ exit to stop, hence membrane does not get hyperpolarized finally causing continued Ach release. K+ channel blockade prolongs the duration of nerve action potential at central, autonomic and neuromuscular synapses thus increasing the release of Ach at presynaptic level.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - The other options mentioned do not lead to increased release of ACh: Blocking Na+ channels on presynaptic membrane: Blocking Na+ (sodium) channels would prevent the generation of action potentials and consequently reduce ACh release rather than increasing it. Blocking leaky Cl- channels on presynaptic membrane: Blocking leaky Cl- (chloride) channels would not directly affect ACh release. Blocking Ca2+ channels on presynaptic membrane: Blocking Ca2+ channels would inhibit the entry of Ca2+ ions into the presynaptic terminal, leading to a decrease in ACh release rather than an increase.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Down regulation of Aquaporin 2 receptors When SIADH persists over time, the kidneys become less responsive to the effects of ADH, leading to downregulation of the aquaporin 2 (AQP2) receptors in the collecting ducts of the kidney tubules.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Vasopressin escape in SIADH results due to downregulation of Aquaporin 2 production. Prolonged exposure to elevated levels of vasopressin (ADH) can lead eventually to downregulation of the production of aquaporin \u2013 2. Although the collecting ducts are being exposed to increased levels of ADH, there is an increase in urine flow & fall in urine osmolality i.e., escape from renal effects of ADH (Vasopressin). This is known as vasopressin Escape. The degree of hyponatremia in SIADH is limited by \u201cVasopressin Escape\u201d; a process that counters the water retaining action of vasopressin. This is characterized by a sudden increase in urine volume with a decrease in urine osmolality INDEPENDENT of circulating vasopressin levels with down regulation of Aquaporin 2 receptors.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Decreased ADH Secretions: This is not accurate in the context of \"Vasopressin escape\" on SIADH. In SIADH, there is excessive secretion of ADH, not decreased secretion. Option: B. Increased osmolality of urine: This is not accurate in the context of \"Vasopressin escape\" on SIADH. In SIADH, the osmolality of urine is typically increased due to excessive water reabsorption, not decreased. Option: C. Upregulation of Aquaporin 2 production: This is not accurate in the context of \"Vasopressin escape\" on SIADH. In SIADH, downregulation of Aquaporin 2 receptors occurs, not upregulation.</p>\n<p></p>",

When the pressure inside the lung is zero, there is some volume of air still present inside the lungs which is less than the functional residual capacity & residual volume which can be called minimum in volume. During expiration, chest wall goes back to its original position thus causing passive recoil of lung tissue in a controlled manner. However, if lung was allowed to recoil without the chest wall in expiration, it would cause sudden collapse leading to minimal lung volume.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Residual volume: Residual volume represents the volume of air that remains in the lungs after maximal expiration when the chest wall and lung are both at their resting positions. Option: B. FRC (Functional Residual Capacity): FRC is the volume of air that remains in the lungs at the end of a normal tidal exhalation, when the chest wall and lung are at their resting positions. FRC is the sum of expiratory reserve volume (ERV) and residual volume (RV). Option: D. Zero: The lung volume cannot be zero under normal circumstances. Even during maximal expiration or after lung recoil, a small volume of air, i.e., the residual volume, remains in the lungs to keep the alveoli open and prevent lung collapse.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Although water is lost through sweating especially in hot climates or during physical exertion, we tend to lose water at rest as well. Physiologically; water evaporates from the skin and lungs at a rate of about 600 to 700 ml/day. This is known as insensible water loss. Insensible losses from skin surfaces or lungs in adults account for about 500-600 ml/day. Note :- Insensible losses refer to the fluid losses that occur from the body through routes that are not easily measured or perceived. These losses mainly occur through evaporation from the skin and respiratory tract and are not associated with urine output or other obvious sources of fluid loss.</p>\n<p></p>",
