      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Prophylactic rifampicin This patient's presentation and the finding of gram-negative diplococci highly suggest meningitis due to Neisseria meningitidis. N meningitidis is transmitted by direct contact with contaminated respiratory secretions or aerosolized droplets . As a result, people with close or intimate contact (eg, household contacts, kissing contacts, health care workers who directly contacted secretions) are at markedly increased risk of meningococcal infection. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis can prevent these secondary cases if given promptly. History of meningococcal vaccination does not preclude the need for antibiotic chemoprophylaxis. Of the listed agents, rifampicin is the only effective choice. Rifampicin penetrates well into all body compartments, including the upper respiratory tract, and will eliminate nasopharyngeal colonization. Other effective agents include ciprofloxacin (not routinely used in children due to concerns about connective tissue injury) and intramuscular ceftriaxone , which is effective but not widely used due to the painful mode of administration. Chemoprophylaxis should be given as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours of diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Persons needing antimicrobial prophylaxis following Neisseria meningitidis exposure Household members Roommates or intimate contacts Child care center workers Persons directly exposed to patient's respiratory or oral secretions (eg, kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, endotracheal intubation/ management) Airline travelers seated next to an affected person for 28 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A : Vaccination is an important public health strategy for the control of meningococcal disease in general, but does not play a role in post-exposure prophylaxis . Immunity following a post-exposure vaccination does not occur in time to prevent disease. Option B : A person's risk for infection is 500-1,000 times greater following exposure to a meningococcal disease patient, and disease onset can be rapid. Therefore, observation alone is not an appropriate strategy for exposed close contacts. Option C : Although penicillin can be used for the treatment of susceptible meningococcal infections , it has not been shown to eliminate nasal carriage or prevent secondary cases. Therefore, it should not be used for chemoprophylaxis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>N. meningitidis is spread through saliva and respiratory secretions during coughing, sneezing, kissing, chewing on toys and through sharing a source of fresh water. It has also been reported to be transmitted through oral sex and cause urethritis in men.[3] It infects its host cells by sticking to them with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc and has several virulence factors.</p>\n<p></p>",

This means the condition may be ignored by those not aware of the significance of the rash. Septicaemia carries an approximate 50% mortality rate over a few hours from initial onset.[citation needed] Other severe complications include Waterhouse\u2013Friderichsen syndrome, a massive, usually bilateral, hemorrhage into the adrenal glands caused by fulminant meningococcemia, adrenal insufficiency, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.</p>\n<p></p>",
