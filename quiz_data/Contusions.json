      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Contusion Hemorrhages in the soft tissues around the eyes and in the eyelids (spectacle hematoma ; black eye), may be caused by: Direct trauma as in contusion such as a punch in the eye, Blunt impact to the forehead, the blood gravitating downwards over the supraorbital bridge, Fracture of the floor of the anterior fossa of the skull. A bruise behind the ear may indicate a basal fracture, rather than a direct blow behind the ear.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option A: Pressure Abrasions /crushing abrasion/friction abrasion They are caused by the crushing of the superficial layers of the epidermis and are associated with a bruise of the surrounding area. If the movement of the instrument is around 90\u00b0 to the skin, a pressure type of abrasion occurs. In this type, the movement is slight and largely directed inwards. The ligature mark in cases of hanging and strangulation and the teeth bite marks are examples. Option B: Patterned abrasion Impact abrasions and pressure abrasions reproduce the pattern of the object causing it and are called patterned abrasions. Patterned injury is any injury that suggests an inflicting instrument or unique means of its causation. Patterned abrasions are produced when the force is applied at a right angle to the surface of the If the skin is struck with a weapon having a patterned surface, or the body falls against a patterned surface, the abrasion of the epidermis is caused by the ridges of the object, if it has a profile of varying height. The skin may be compressed into the cavities of the pattern with capillary damage leading to an intradermal bruise, e.g., when a motor tire passes over the skin. Other examples of patterned abrasion are imprints of bicycle chains, weaves of coarse fabrics, the spiral of electric wires, ropes, serrated knives, etc. Multi-thronged whip, such as a cat-o-nine-tails, leaves a series of linear abrasions or superficial tears. Usually, the pattern and shape are non-specific. Option C: Impact Abrasions (contact or imprint abrasions): They are caused by impact with a rough object when the force is applied at or near a right angle to the skin surface. The abrasion is slightly depressed below the surface unless there is bulging due to underlying contusion or local edema. If the impact is forcible, the dermis is damaged with an underlying bruise. When a person is knocked down by a motor car, the pattern of the radiator grille, a headlamp rim, or the tread of the tire may be seen on the skin, which may contain road dirt, paint flakes, grease, etc. Impact by a solid object may produce abrasion at the periphery where the skin is forced downwards. If a person strikes a flat and relatively smooth surface, an abrasion can be produced which shows little or no linear markings, as in traffic accidents.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Brush burn An abrasion caused by violent lateral (tangential) rubbing against a surface as in dragging over the ground is called brush burn or gravel rash. It is a scraping injury over a large area. \"Friction burn\" (scuff or brush abrasion) is an extensive, superficial, reddened excoriated area without serous ooze or bleeding and with little or no linear mark. It may occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface or when the skin is covered by clothing.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Point Scratch: The shown image is covering an area not just a line or scratch. Hence is not the answer. Option: C. Ectopic bruising, or Percolated or Migratory contusion:- The bruise which appears in some other site apart from the area of impact. Option: D. An incised wound (cut, slice) is a clean cut through the tissues, (usually the skin and subcutaneous tissues, including blood vessels), caused by sharp-edged instruments. The wound is longer than it is deep.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Shearing laceration Avulsion (shearing laceration) : An avulsion is a laceration produced by sufficient force (shearing force) delivered at an acute angle to detach (tear off) a portion of a traumatized surface or viscus from its attachments. The shearing and grinding force by weight, such as a lorry wheel passing over a limb may produce separation of the skin from the underlying tissues (avulsion) over a relatively large area. This is called \"flying\"</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Stretch Lacerations : Overstretching of the skin, if it is fixed, will cause a There is localized pressure with a pull which increases until tearing occurs and produces a flap of skin, which is peeled off the underlying bone or deep fascia. This is seen in the running over by a motor vehicle, and the flap may indicate the direction of the vehicle. They can occur from kicking, and also when sudden deformity of a bone occurs after fracture, making it compound. Option: B. Split laceration Splitting occurs by crushing the skin between two hard objects. Scalp lacerations occur due to the tissues being crushed between the skull and some hard object, such as the ground or a blunt instrument Splits are not undermined but show tissue bridges. Option: C. Cut Lacerations : Cut lacerations may be produced by a heavy relatively sharp-edged instrument such as an axe, hatchet, or etc. The margins are usually abraded with bruising.</p>\n<p></p>",
