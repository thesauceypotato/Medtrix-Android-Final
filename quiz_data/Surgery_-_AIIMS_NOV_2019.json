Renal trauma is usually a part of polytrauma and is present in only 5% of all trauma cases. Mechanism Of Injury: Trauma may be penetrating or blunt, the latter being far more common Common Modes: Head-on collisions in road traffic accidents Falls from height Contact sports Sudden rapid deceleration (Avulsion Injury to ureter at PUJ) Penetrating injuries cause direct tissue disruption and are usually associated with adjacent organ injuries Presentation: Loss of Consciousness Hemodynamic Shock Haematuria (Pathognomic) Abdominal Pain with flank contusions Diagnosis: CECT of the abdomen is necessary to delineate the type and extent of renal injury. It provides information about the presence of parenchymal laceration, its depth, extension into the pelvicalyceal system, and the extent of urinary extravasation. It also provides valuable information about other abdominal injuries and the status of the contralateral kidney. Common indications for CECT in abdominal trauma include: Abdominal trauma with gross haematuria Microscopic haematuria with hypotension (systolic <90 mmHg) Rapid deceleration injury Children with microscopic haematuria (>5 red blood cells [RBCs]) All penetrating injuries. Indications for emergency surgical exploration are: Expanding or pulsatile retroperitoneal hematoma PUJ avulsion Renal pedicle injury hemodynamic instability Treatment: Conservative management with close surveillance is sufficient in the majority of cases of isolated renal trauma. Lower-grade injuries, sometimes including grade IV, can be managed conservatively with bed rest, antibiotics in case of penetrating injuries, and serial hemoglobin estimation. Reimaging is usually done after 2\u20134 days in cases of falling hemoglobin levels, fever, or expanding fank mass.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Grade-4 In the above-given image of a pressure sore, there is a total thickness loss seen with an exposure of the bone site. Hence it can be classified as a Grade 4 pressure sore. Pressure ulcers can be graded according to an internationally recognized grading system based on the extent of skin loss. Category 1 ulcers involve non-blanching erythema with intact skin. Category 2 ulcers have partial thickness skin loss and appear as shallow open ulcers with a red-pink wound bed or an intact or ruptured serum-filled blister. Category 3 ulcers have full-thickness skin loss, with subcutaneous fat visible in the wound but not bone, tendon, or muscle. Category 4 ulcers have complete thickness loss with exposed bone, tendon, or muscle; osteomyelitis may develop at these sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Pressure Sores Patients undergoing surgery for a prolonged period are vulnerable to developing a pressure sore or worsening a pre-existing sore due to prolonged immobility during, and sometimes after, the operation. Careful positioning and padding of the patient are standard practices intraoperatively to reduce the risk. Pressure sores occur due to friction or persisting pressure on soft tissues. They mainly affect the pressure points of a recumbent patient, including the sacrum, greater trochanter, and heels. Poor nutritional status, dehydration, lack of mobility, and nerve-block anesthesia technique are risk factors . Common sites for pressure injuries and ulcers Ischium Greater trochanter Sacrum Heel Malleolus Occiput Management : Early mobilization of the patient and regular inspection of pressure points by the nursing Team can act to prevent pressure sores. High-risk patients may be nursed on an air mattress , which automatically relieves the pressure areas. Surgical Management : Primary closure and skin grafting should be avoided as they are likely to fail. In suitable patients, successful reconstruction options include the use of large fasciocutaneous or musculocutaneous flaps . If possible, use a fap that can be advanced further if there is recurrence and does not interfere with the planning of neighboring faps that may be used.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In chronic wounds, such as in pressure sores, burns or osteomyelitis, the chronicity of the inflammatory environment can lead to the development of a Marjolin ulcer.

T-tube Drains: A T-tube may be inserted after exploration of the common bile duct and stone retrieval or following repair of a damaged common bile duct . The principle is to allow bile drain while the sphincter of Oddi is in spasm postoperatively and to act as a safety valve if there are any stones retained in the distal ordinary bile duct</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Barbed sutures are increasingly being used for fascial closure. This suture has tiny barbs in a spiral arrangement that allow an even distribution of tension across the incision rather than just at the knots Barbed sutures have also been shown to have a similar hernia recurrence rate in fascial plication for rectus diastasis . They are secured without knots, thus allowing for faster placement, and eliminate the knot as a nidus for infection</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Lahey's method Lahey method of palpating the posterior surface of the thyroid gland The video demonstrates Lahey's method of thyroid palpation, which involves pushing the lobes of the thyroid to one side for palpation. To palpate the left lobe, the examiner uses their left hand to push the lobe laterally and palpates it with the right hand. Examiner stands in front of the patient Gland is pushed to one side, ideal for palpating margins</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Differential diagnosis of hyperthyroidism INCREASED HORMONE SYNTHESIS (INCREASED RAIU) RELEASE OF PREFORMED HORMONE (DECREASED RAIU) Graves' disease (diffuse toxic goiter) Toxic multinodular goiter Toxic adenoma Drug induced\u2014amiodarone, iodine Thyroid cancer Struma ovarii Hydatidiform mole TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma Thyroiditis\u2014acute phase of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, subacute thyroiditis Factitious (iatrogenic) thyrotoxicosis \"Hamburger thyrotoxicosis\u201d RAIU = radioactive iodine uptake; TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B: Describes Pemberton's sign , which is not a method but a test based on the principle that obstruction to significant veins in the thorax can cause engorgement of neck veins. Patients are asked to raise their hands above their heads and touch their ears with their arms. Development of facial congestion and breathlessness indicates a positive sign and is seen in patients with retrosternal goiter. Option C: Kocher's method demonstrates the pressure effect of the thyroid gland on the trachea or larynx. Lateral compression of the gland can result in stridor. Option D: Crile method: Thumb on the gland, the patient is asked to swallow (To look for nodularity or slight thyroid enlargement).</p>\n<p></p>",
