Examples : Pregnancy, intestinal obstruction, poorly controlled gastroesophageal reflux disease, morbid obesity. Cardiac arrest patients should also be considered as full stomach. The goal is to intubate rapidly to minimize the time between the loss of consciousness and securing of the airway with a cuffed endotracheal tube .</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>2, 3, 4 and 5 is correct For cannulation in newborns, we would require a 24G needle, 5 mL syringe, adhesive tape, and normal saline. We use a 24G needle for >1 kg neonate, and for <1 kg neonate, we use a 28G needle. We need to avoid using 1 mL syringes for flushing as it may lead to catheter rupture; preferably, use 5 or 10 mL syringes. Flushing of the cannulation is done using 0.9% sodium chloride or so-called normal saline (NS).</p>\n<p></p>",
