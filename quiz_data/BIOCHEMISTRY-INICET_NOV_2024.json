It oxidizes four lysine residues together to form desmosine which makes cross linkages in elastin. In copper deficiency, elastin becomes abnormal, leading to weakening of walls of major blood vessels. Menke\u2019s kinky hair syndrome It is an x-linked defect (affects only male child). It is a condition in which dietary copper is absorbed from GI tract; but cannot be transported to blood due to absence of an intracellular copper binding ATPase (mutation inATP7A gene). Copper is not mobilized from intestinal cells as well as in other tissue cells. The copper that has entered into the cell is not able to get out of the cells, and so it is accumulated. Hence, copper is not available for metabolism, resulting in defective cross-linking of connective tissue. Vascular and connective tissues are affected, and child dies usually in infancy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B.
