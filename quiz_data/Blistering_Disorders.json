IgG autoantibodies to desmosomal components (desmoglein 1 and 3) can be seen in patients with pemphigus vulgaris. The formation of autoantibodies to these structural proteins results in loss of cell-cell adhesion, leading to mucocutaneous blister formation, as seen in this patient. It is an immunobullous disease ( Type 2 hypersensitivity, IgG antibodies ) which commonly presents at 40 to 60 years of age.

Gap junctions: These are channels that allow for the direct communication and exchange of small molecules between adjacent cells. Autoantibodies directed against gap junctions have not been associated with any known autoimmune bullous disorder. Option B. Tight junctions: These are a type of cell junction that create a barrier between adjacent cells, regulating the movement of ions and molecules across cell layers. Autoantibodies directed against tight junctions have not been associated with any known autoimmune bullous disorder. Option C. Hemidesmosomes: These are specialized cell junctions that anchor epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane. Autoantibodies directed against hemidesmosomes are associated with a subtype of bullous but not with Pemphigus vulgaris.</p>\n<p></p>",
