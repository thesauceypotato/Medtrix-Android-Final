IRS is still the preferred method of vector control in areas with very hot summers where ITNs are not acceptable to population DDT is the insecticide of choice In areas where the vector has shown resistance to DDT, the alternatives are malathion and synthetic pyrethroids Two rounds of spraying are done for DDT and synthetic pyrethroids to provide protection during the entire transmission season In case of malathion, three rounds of spraying are required. The real coverage of IRS is limited by low community acceptance due to white marks left on plastered surface, acrid smell associated with malathion and replastering of walls after completion of IRS.</p>\n<p></p>",
