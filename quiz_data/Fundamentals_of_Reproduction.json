The aging process varies in degree and should be differentiated from the morbid process likely to affect the organ in some pathological states. The aging process involves both the fetal and maternal components. VILLI CHANGES: The following changes are observed as pregnancy advances toward term Decreasing thickness of the syncytium and appearances of syncytial knots (aggregation of the syncytium in small areas on the sides of the villus); Partial disappearance of trophoblast cells; Decrease in the stromal tissue including Hofbauer cells (fetal macrophages); Obliteration of some vessels and marked dilatation of the capillaries; Thickening of the basement layer of the fetal endothelium and the cytotrophoblast; Deposition of fibrin on the surface of the villi. Schematic diagram showing transverse section of a villus in (A) early month and (B) near term DECIDUAL CHANGES: There is an area of fibrinoid degeneration where trophoblast cells (covered with syncytium) meet the decidua. This zone is known as Nitabuch's layer . This layer limits further invasion of the decidua by the trophoblast. The membrane is absent in placenta accreta. INTERVILLOUS SPACE: The syncytium covering the villi and extending into the decidua of intervillous space undergoes fibrinoid degeneration and form a mass entangling variable number of villi. These are called white infarcts which vary in size from few millimeters to a centimeter or more. Calcification or even cyst formation may occur on it.

Twin peak or lambda sign: It is characteristic of dichorionic pregnancies and is due to the chorionic tissue between the two layers of the intertwin membrane at the placental origin. A potential space exists in the intertwin membrane which is filled by proliferating plancental villi, giving rise to a twin peak sign.

The factors responsible for blastocyst attachmen t are: selectin, heparin sulfate, proteoglycan, EGF, integrins, trophinin and others. The signals for trophoblast multiplication arise from the inner cell mass. Point 1. ENDOMETRIUM AT THE IMPLANTATION SITE : (1) The endometrium is in the secretory phase corresponding to 20\u201321 days of cycle. (2) The microvilli on the surface of the trophectoderm interdigitate with the decidual cells to form the junctional complexes. Endometrial receptivity and molecular signaling during implantation is induced by progesterone, LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), prostaglandins and COX-2 . Point 2. APPOSITION : Occurs through pinopode formation. Pinopods are long finger-like projections (microvilli) from the endometrial cell surface. These pinopods absorb the endometrial fluid which is secreted by the endometrial gland cells. This fluid, rich in glycogen and mucin, provides nutrition to the blastocyst initially. Unless this fluid is absorbed, the adhesion phase cannot occur. Adhesion of blastocyst to the endometrium occurs through the adhesion molecules like integrin, selectin and cadherin (glycoproteins) .

Capacitation takes place in the genital tract and takes about 2\u20136 hours . The changes involve cyclic AMP dependent phosphorylation with increase in intracellular pH (influx of Ca++ and efflux of H+). Point 2. Nutrition for sperm is obtained from Fructose Point 3.

Since division of cells is not a part of the implantation. The correct answer is B.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Implantation occurs in the endometrium of the anterior or posterior wall of the body near the fundus on the 6th day which corresponds to the 20th day of a regular menstrual cycle. Implantation occurs through four stages e.g. apposition, adhesion, penetration and invasion. CHANGES IN THE BLASTOCYST: The polar trophoblast cells adjacent to the inner cell mass are primarily involved in adhesion to the endometrial cells. The factors responsible for blastocyst attachmen t are: selectin, heparin sulfate, proteoglycan, EGF, integrins, trophinin and others. The signals for trophoblast multiplication arise from the inner cell mass. Point 1. ENDOMETRIUM AT THE IMPLANTATION SITE : (1) The endometrium is in the secretory phase corresponding to 20\u201321 days of cycle. (2) The microvilli on the surface of the trophectoderm interdigitate with the decidual cells to form the junctional complexes. Endometrial receptivity and molecular signaling during implantation is induced by progesterone, LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), prostaglandins and COX-2 . Point 2. APPOSITION : Occurs through pinopode formation. Pinopods are long finger-like projections (microvilli) from the endometrial cell surface. These pinopods absorb the endometrial fluid which is secreted by the endometrial gland cells. This fluid, rich in glycogen and mucin, provides nutrition to the blastocyst initially. Unless this fluid is absorbed, the adhesion phase cannot occur. Adhesion of blastocyst to the endometrium occurs through the adhesion molecules like integrin, selectin and cadherin (glycoproteins) . Point 3. PENETRATION : Actual penetration and invasion occur through the stromal cells in between the glands and is facilitated by the histolytic action of the blastocyst. Point 4. Implantation occurs through four stages g. apposition, adhesion, penetration and invasion.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option:A .

Meiosis is a special type of cell division that reduces the diploid number of chromosomes (i.e., 46) to the haploid number of 23 . It takes place only in germ cells; to give rise to gametes (sperms and egg cells) It involves two meiotic cell division s, meiosis I and meiosis IL. The first meiotic division is a reduction division because the chromosome number is reduced from diploid (46) to haploid (23) . The 2nd meiotic division is similar to mitosis as daughter cells formed contain the same haploid number of chromosomes as the mother cell.</p>\n<p></p>",
