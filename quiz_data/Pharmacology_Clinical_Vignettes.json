They reduce inflammation, modulate neurotransmitter activity, and enhance the effectiveness of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists like ondansetron. Dexamethasone is especially useful in delayed CINV, making it an effective choice. B) Dronabinol:</li><li>\u2022 Dronabinol is a cannabinoid receptor agonist (synthetic THC) that helps reduce nausea and stimulate appetite.

If given to a patient on chronic morphine therapy, it can precipitate opioid withdrawal and worsen pain control.

(B) Alvimopan</li><li>\u2022 Another peripherally acting \u00b5-opioid receptor antagonist used to treat opioid-induced bowel dysfunction.

The correct relationship is: K=0.7/(t1/2) This helps determine drug elimination over time, but it does not directly determine the maintenance dose. (B) = Amount of drug in body / Drug plasma concentration Incorrect, because this formula calculates the volume of distribution (Vd), not the maintenance dose. The formula for Vd is: Vd=Amount of drug in body/(Plasma concentration (CP)) This helps determine drug distribution, but it does not predict the required dose. (D) = Cp \u00d7 Vd / F Incorrect, because this is the formula for the loading dose, not the maintenance dose. The loading dose is used to rapidly achieve a therapeutic plasma concentration, whereas the maintenance dose ensures steady-state levels.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u2022 Mechanism of Hypertension: Phenylephrine stimulates \u03b1 1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle, leading to peripheral vasoconstriction. This increases systemic vascular resistance (SVR), which can raise blood pressure. The increase in blood pressure may trigger a reflex bradycardia as a compensatory response. This effect is more pronounced in elderly patients or those with preexisting hypertension. Because hypertension is a well-known adverse effect of phenylephrine, (D) is the correct answer.</li><li>\u2022 Explanation for the Incorrect Answers: (A) Constipation</li><li>\u2022 Phenylephrine does not have significant effects on the gastrointestinal (GI) system. Constipation is more commonly seen with opioids or drugs with anticholinergic effects (e.g., atropine). Since phenylephrine does not act on muscarinic receptors, constipation is not a typical side effect. (B) Diarrhea</li><li>\u2022 Phenylephrine primarily acts on blood vessels, not on the intestinal smooth muscle. Diarrhea is more commonly associated with drugs that increase GI motility, such as cholinergic agonists or certain antibiotics. Since phenylephrine causes vasoconstriction and not GI stimulation, it is unlikely to cause diarrhea. (C) Epistaxis</li><li>\u2022 Phenylephrine is used as a nasal decongestant due to its vasoconstrictive properties, which help reduce nasal swelling. While excessive use of nasal sprays containing phenylephrine may lead to rebound congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa), it does not directly cause nosebleeds (epistaxis). Epistaxis is more commonly linked to nasal dryness, trauma, or excessive anticoagulation, rather than phenylephrine use.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

ACh is involved in parasympathetic signaling and neuromuscular transmission. Drugs affecting ACh (e.g., anticholinergics like atropine or cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil) do not treat migraines.</li><li>\u2022 (C) Dopamine Incorrect because triptans do not primarily act on dopamine receptors. Dopamine plays a role in nausea and vomiting associated with migraines, and dopamine antagonists (e.g., metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) are sometimes used as adjunct therapy for migraines, but triptans act on serotonin, not dopamine.</li><li>\u2022 (D) Epinephrine Incorrect because triptans do not directly affect epinephrine receptors. Epinephrine acts on \u03b1 and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, influencing heart rate, vasoconstriction, and bronchodilation. Adrenergic agonists (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine) are not used for migraine treatment.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
