Treatment option with trastuzumab, tamoxifen, & aromatase inhibitor is also unavailable. Incidence of luminal (ER-positive/HER2-negative), HER2 (HER2-positive), and triple-negative (ER-negative/HER2-negative) breast cancers according to age. Rates are per 100,000 women. Triple-negative (solid blue line) and HER2 (solid green line) cancers have a relatively constant incidence after the age of 40 years. In contrast, luminal cancers show a marked increase in incidence with age. This increase is greatest for women of European descent (solid yellow line) and less pronounced for women of other ethnic backgrounds (African, Hispanic, and Asian) (broken yellow line). TNBC, Triple-negative breast cancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) is a type of breast cancer. TNBC lacks expression of estrogen receptor (ER) , progesterone receptor (PR) , and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBC does not respond to hormone therapy or HER2-targeted therapy. TNBC accounts for approximately 10-20% of all breast cancers. TNBC tends to be more aggressive and fast-growing than other types of breast cancer. TNBC is more common in younger women, women of African or Hispanic descent, and women with a BRCA1 gene mutation. Treatment options for TNBC typically include chemotherapy and surgery.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

ER+, PR+, HER-2-neu -negative with high proliferation is luminal type B. Hormonal therapy can be given. Option: D. ER-, PR-, HER-2-neu +positive , is known as HER-2-neu enriched, and it has a better prognosis since the use of trastuzumab has started.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>TNBC is often diagnosed at a later stage than other types of breast cancer, which can make treatment more challenging. TNBC is associated with a higher risk of recurrence and metastasis compared to other types of breast cancer. TNBC may respond to immunotherapy, which stimulates the immune system to attack cancer cells. Women with a BRCA1 gene mutation are at higher risk of developing TNBC. TNBC is an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to develop new treatments and improve outcomes for patients.</p>\n<p></p>",

Distant metastasis indicates that the cancer has spread beyond the breast and nearby lymph nodes, and is a strong indicator of poor prognosis.

The likelihood of distant metastasis depends on several factors, including the stage and subtype of breast cancer, as well as patient-related factors such as age, overall health, and the presence of other medical conditions. In addition to systemic treatments such as chemotherapy and hormone therapy, targeted therapies may be used to treat breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Even in cases where distant metastasis is present, there are still treatment options available, and some patients may be able to achieve long-term remission or even cure. It is important for patients with breast cancer to undergo regular imaging and testing to monitor for signs of distant metastasis, even after initial treatment is complete.</p>\n<p></p>",

Other risk factors for breast cancer include age, family history, genetic mutations (such as BRCA1 or BRCA2), previous breast cancer or breast biopsy results, certain benign breast conditions, exposure to radiation, and hormonal factors (such as early menstruation, late menopause, and hormone therapy). Breast cancer can occur at any age, but it is most commonly diagnosed in women over the age of 50. Regular breast cancer screening is recommended starting at age 40 for women at average risk of breast cancer, but women with a higher risk may need to start screening earlier or undergo more frequent or intensive screening. Breast cancer treatment may be physically and emotionally challenging, and women with breast cancer may benefit from a supportive network of healthcare providers, family members, and friends.</p>\n<p></p>",

LCIS is considered a marker for increased risk rather than an inevitable precursor of invasive disease. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is a benign entity and is removed from TNM staging in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 8th edition. Treatment of DCIS constitutes Mastectomy or Breast-conserving surgery with Radiation Therapy, & +/- Hormonal Treatment. LCIS is a condition of the breast which is a marker for increased CA risk. It is not considered in-situ carcinoma anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>LCIS ( lobular carcinoma in situ ) is a type of non-invasive breast cancer that develops in the milk-producing glands of the breast, but does not invade the surrounding tissue. LCIS is generally considered to have the most favorable outcome among the scenarios listed. DCIS ( ductal carcinoma in situ ) is another type of non-invasive breast cancer that is highly treatable, but is associated with a slightly higher risk of recurrence and progression to invasive breast cancer than LCIS. Pregnancy-associated breast cancer refers to breast cancer that is diagnosed during pregnancy or within one year of giving birth, and its prognosis can vary depending on the stage at diagnosis.

LCIS is more common in women who are premenopausal (have not yet gone through menopause) and in women who have a family history of breast cancer. LCIS is often classified into two subtypes: classic type LCIS and pleomorphic type LCIS. The pleomorphic type is more likely to progress to invasive breast cancer than the classic type. Women with LCIS who have a family history of breast cancer or other risk factors may benefit from genetic counseling and testing to determine if they have inherited a genetic mutation that increases their risk of breast cancer. Women who have been diagnosed with LCIS should talk to their healthcare provider about the best way to reduce their risk of developing invasive breast cancer, which may include lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and limiting alcohol intake.</p>\n<p></p>",
