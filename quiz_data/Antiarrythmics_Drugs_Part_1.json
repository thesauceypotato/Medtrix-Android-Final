It also maintains sinus rhythm in AF when other drugs have failed. Rapid termination of ventricular (VT and VF) and supraventricular arrhythmias can be obtained by i.v. Injection. WPW tachyarrhythmia is terminated by suppression of both normal and aberrant pathways. The long duration of action makes amiodarone suitable for chronic prophylactic therapy. Apart from propranolol, it is the only antiarrhythmic drug that, in the long term, has been found to reduce sudden cardiac death. Because of high and broad-spectrum efficacy and relatively low proarrhythmic potential, amiodarone is a very commonly used antiarrhythmic, despite its organ toxicity.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B .
