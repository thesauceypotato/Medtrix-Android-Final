The puncture should be done well below the termination of the cord, i.e. lower border of LI. A horizontal line joining the highest points of the iliac crests passes through the spine of the fourth lumbar vertebra. Therefore, the interspinous spaces immediately above and below this landmark can be used safely. The interspinous space between L3 and L4 is the most preferred site. Because in this region, subarachnoid space is roomier and contains only filum terminale and roots of lumbar, sacral and coccygeal nerves forming the cauda equina. During this procedure, the spine must be fully flexed with the patient lying on the side or seated. So, the interspinous spaces are opened to their maximum extent, and the lower end of the spinal cord is slightly raised. The needle is passed inwards and somewhat crani- ally exactly in the midline. The supraspinous and interspinous ligaments are traversed, and then the dura mater is penetrated, with a distinct feel of \u2018give way\u2019. Occasionally, root pain is experienced if the roots of cauda equina are impinged upon, but usually, they float clear of the needle.

After that, the vertebral column grows faster than the spinal cord, and the spinal cord's terminal end gradually shifts to a higher level. Consequently, at birth, the spinal cord ends at the level of the third lumbar vertebra, while in adulthood, it terminates at the level of the lower border of L1 (or the intervertebral disc between the LI and L2). The knowledge of these variations in the vertebral level of the lower end of the cord is essential to avoid injury to the cord while performing lumbar puncture, especially in children.</p>\n<p></p>",
