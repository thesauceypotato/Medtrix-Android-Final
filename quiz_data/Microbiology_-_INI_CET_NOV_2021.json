      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1 Region labelled as 1 is the lipid A part; which is mainly responsible for endotoxic shock due to gram negative bacteria. Gram Negative Bacteria Cell Wall Gram-negative bacteria are characterized by their cell envelopes , which are composed of a thin peptidoglycan cell wall sandwiched between an inner cytoplasmic cell membrane and a bacterial outer membrane . The outer membrane consists of molecules of phospholipids, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoproteins and surface proteins. The lipopolysaccharide consists of lipid A and O polysaccharide. In electron micrographs, the Gram-negative cell wall appears multi-layered due to this structure. The outer membrane of the Gram-negative cell wall appears as a lipid bilayer about 7 nm thick. It is composed of phospholipids, lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and proteins. Phospholipids are located mainly in the inner layer of the outer membrane, as are the lipoproteins that connect the outer membrane to the peptidoglycan. Peptidoglycan is composed of cross-linked chains of peptidoglycan monomers (NAG-NAM-pentapeptide). Trans glycosidase enzymes join these monomers join together to form chains. Transpeptidase enzymes then cross-link the chains to provide strength to the cell wall and enable the bacterium to resist osmotic lysis. The lipopolysaccharides, located in the outer layer of the outer membrane, consist of a lipid portion called lipid A embedded in the membrane and a polysaccharide portion extending outward from the bacterial surface. The LPS portion of the outer membrane is also known as endotoxin. In addition, pore-forming proteins called porins span the outer membrane. The porins function as channels for the entry and exit of solutes through the outer membrane of the Gram-negative cell wall.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>EPEC Enterotoxigenic coli (ETEC) ETEC is an important cause of diarrhoea (usually diarrhoea without fever) in infants and traveler\u2019s in underdeveloped countries or regions of poor sanitation. ETEC may produce a heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) that is similar in molecular size, sequence, antigenicity, and function to the cholera toxin (Ctx) (binds to the same identical ganglioside receptors that are recognized by the cholera toxin (i.e., GM1), and its enzymatic activity is identical to that of the cholera toxin.) ETEC may also produce a heat stable toxin (ST) that is of low molecular size and resistant to boiling for 30 minutes. ETEC adhesins are fimbriae (CFA I and CFA II) which are species-specific and help colonize the GI tract. Entero invasive coli (EIEC) EIEC closely resemble Shigella in their pathogenic mechanisms and the kind of clinical illness they produce (dysentery-like diarrhoea with fever). EIEC penetrate and multiply within epithelial cells of the colon causing widespread cell destruction. EIEC apparently lack fimbrial adhesins but do possess a specific adhesin that, as in Shigella , is thought to be an outer membrane protein. Also, like Shigella , EIEC are invasive organisms. They do not produce LT or ST toxin. Unlike typical coli , EIEC are non-motile, do not decarboxylate lysine and do not ferment lactose. Enterohemorrhagic coli (EHEC) EHEC are recognized as the primary cause of haemorrhagic colitis (HC) or bloody diarrhoea, which can progress to the potentially fatal hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). EHEC are characterized by the production of verotoxin or Shiga toxins (Stx). O157:H7 is the prototypic EHEC and most often implicated in illness worldwide. The infectious dose for O157:H7 is estimated to be 10 - 100 cells. EHEC strains produce a toxin that is virtually identical to the Shiga toxin, is phage encoded and its production is enhanced by iron deficiency. Enteropathogenic coli (EPEC) Non fimbrial adhesin (intimin): outer membrane protein that mediates the final stages of adherence Plasmid-encoded protein referred to as EPEC adherence factor (EAF) enables localized adherence of bacteria to intestinal cells Adherence of EPEC strains to the intestinal mucosa: rearrangements of actin in the vicinity of adherent bacteria; k/a \"attachment and effacing\" of cells. Moderately invasive (not as invasive as Shigella or EIEC) Does not produce LT or ST; some reports of shiga-like toxin Usually infantile diarrhoea; watery diarrhoea with blood, some inflammation, No fever; symptoms probably result mainly from invasion rather than toxigenesis Enteroaggregative coli (EAEC) Adhesins not characterized Non invasive Produce ST-like toxin (EAST) and a hemolysin Persistent diarrhea in young children without inflammation or fever</p>\n<p></p>",

Steps of the HSV replication cycle: Binding: gB (HSV-1 and HSV-2) plus gC (HSV-1) participate in virus binding to the surface of the cells, which is followed by gD binding to one of its receptors. Entry: after the fusion of membranes, the viral capsid and tegument proteins are internalized in the cytoplasm. Capsid transport to the nucleus: once in the cytoplasm, the viral capsid accumulates in the nucleus either by simple diffusion or aided by cytoskeletal structures, such as microtubules. Transcription: HSV genes are transcribed sequentially as \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 genes. Translation: viral mRNAs are translated sequentially (\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 proteins) Replication: viral genome replication occurs as a rolling circle. Capsid Assembly: HSV capsids are assembled within the nucleus of infected cells. Glycosylation: glycoproteins are translated and glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Glycoprotein export to the cell surface: glycoproteins are processed in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Then, they are exported to the plasma membrane. Glycoprotein-containing plasma membrane endocytosis. Envelopment: glycoproteins within early endosomes (EE) fuse with capsids in the cytoplasm. Virus release: virions in the extracellular medium.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>RT- PCR followed by real time \u2013 PCR A two-step approach using qualitative RT(REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE)-PCR (for detection) and quantitative PCR (for viral load quantification) is highly recommended for studies focusing on viral loads or better detection of RNA samples. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a relatively simple and inexpensive technique to determine the expression level of target genes. It involves the generation of complementary DNA (cDNA) copies of the mRNA using reverse transcriptase enzyme followed by amplification of cDNA copies by PCR technique. Real-time PCR allows for the detection of PCR amplification in the exponential growth phase of the reaction and is much more quantitative than traditional RT-PCR. Thus, combination of these techniques would yield much better results. qPCR plays an important role in the detection, quantification, and typing of viral pathogens. In real time PCR (aka quantitative PCR\u2014qPCR), fluorescence is measured after each cycle and the intensity of the fluorescent signal reflects the momentary amount of DNA amplicons in the sample at that specific time. In initial cycles the fluorescence is too low to be distinguishable from the background. However, the point at which the fluorescence intensity increases above the detectable level corresponds proportionally to the initial number of template DNA molecules in the sample. This point is called the quantification cycle and allows determination of the absolute quantity of target DNA in the sample according to a calibration curve constructed of serially diluted standard samples (usually decimal dilutions) with known concentrations or copy numbers.</p>\n<p></p>",

Infections are most common in the tropics. Diagnosis requires sampling at the site of infection; direct microscopy using KOH (potassium hydroxide), haematoxylin and eosin, and/or Fontana-Masson stains; and culturing. Accurate species identification is essential. Treatment includes antifungal therapy with or without surgery, and antifungal susceptibility testing is recommended for all cultures.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Antibody heterogeneity The heterophile test (Paul-Bunnell test) is the most common and specific test to confirm the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. The heterophile antibody is an immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody produced by infected B lymphocytes. It is not directed against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or EBV-infected cells, but it is a result of the infection and the subsequent transformation of the B cell to a plasmacytoid state. In the heterophile test, human blood is first absorbed by a guinea pig kidney. Then, it is tested for agglutination activity that is directed against horse, sheep, or cow erythrocytes. Successive dilutions yield a titer; a titer of 40 or greater is considered a positive test. The heterophile antibody is present in 40-60% of patients with infectious mononucleosis in the first week of the illness and in 80-90% of cases by the third or fourth week. Repeated testing may be indicated in patients with the clinical syndrome who tested negative early in the course of the illness. The heterophile response usually persists for 3 months, although it may be present for as long as a year following onset. While the heterophile test is a quantitative assay, the various Monospot tests are qualitative. Monospot tests are slightly more sensitive (85%) than the heterophile assay, but false-positive findings may occur in children or in patients with other viral illnesses.</p>\n<p></p>",
