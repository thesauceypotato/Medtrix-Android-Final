The cholera toxin (2 subunits \u2013 A & B) does not enter the intestinal cells directly; instead, it binds to the GM1 ganglioside receptor on the surface of the intestinal epithelial cells. This binding facilitates the entry of the toxin into the cells.</li><li>\u2022 Once inside the cell, the cholera toxin activates the enzyme adenylate cyclase, leading to an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Elevated cAMP levels cause the inhibition of sodium absorption and an increase in chloride and water secretion into the intestinal lumen.

A) 1% Atropine</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 1% Atropine is the preferred drug for refraction in a child (<7 yr children) with squint, particularly because it is the strongest cycloplegic agent available.</li><li>\u2022 Children often have strong accommodation, which can interfere with accurate refraction, especially in cases of accommodative esotropia. Using a potent cycloplegic like 1% atropine helps to fully relax the accommodation, allowing for precise measurement of refractive errors.</li><li>\u2022 Atropine 1% is typically preferred in ointment form due to its longer duration of action and ease of application. The ointment can be applied to the eyelashes or lower lid, ensuring widespread coverage over the entire eye surface. This is especially useful for children under the age of 7 who require thorough cycloplegia for accurate refraction.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

B) Facial nerve</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The patient's symptoms, including ear pain, difficulty eating, and inability to close the eye completely, strongly suggest a case of facial palsy or Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy is a condition characterized by sudden weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles, typically affecting one side of the face. The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) is responsible for controlling the muscles of facial expression, and its dysfunction leads to the presented symptoms.</li><li>\u2022 The presence of a swelling below the ear further supports the involvement of the facial nerve. The parotid gland, located in this region, is closely associated with the facial nerve, which divides into five terminal branches within the gland. Damage or inflammation of the parotid gland can lead to compression or involvement of the facial nerve, resulting in facial palsy.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Great auricular nerve: Incorrect. While the great auricular nerve provides sensory innervation over the angle of the mandible and the area around the ear (shaving area), it is not directly responsible for the motor functions affected in this case. If the patient had ear pain or loss of sensation in the shaving area without the Bell's palsy features, the great auricular nerve could have been considered.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Great auricular nerve:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Vagus nerve: Incorrect. The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) does not directly control the facial muscles or cause the symptoms described here.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Vagus nerve:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Auriculotemporal nerve: Incorrect. The auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, supplies sensory innervation to the auricle and temporal region but does not control the facial muscles or cause the symptoms of facial palsy. If the patient had symptoms like increased sweating, redness, or blood supply in this area, it could have suggested an auriculotemporal nerve syndrome (Frey's syndrome).</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

To prevent leakage from these structures, the surgeon can either clamp them along the free margin or insert a finger behind the lesser omentum and place the thumb above it, compressing the VAD between the finger and thumb.

C) Psoriatic Arthritis</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is characterized by joint pain and stiffness, which is often worse in the morning and improves with activity, indicating the presence of morning stiffness. The involvement of distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints is particularly notable in PsA and is a distinguishing feature. The presence of silvery, scaly plaques on the skin, especially on the extensor surfaces like elbows and knees, aligns with the diagnosis of psoriasis, a common comorbidity in PsA. Additionally, a positive family history for psoriasis strongly supports this diagnosis.</li><li>\u2022 The swelling observed in the DIP joints can be specifically referred to as dactylitis, which is a hallmark of PsA. This form of arthritis is also known as seronegative arthritis, meaning it is negative for rheumatoid factor, distinguishing it from rheumatoid arthritis. PsA is an erosive arthritis that can lead to joint damage if not properly managed.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Rheumatoid Arthritis : Typically involves the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints rather than the DIP joints. It is usually seropositive, meaning it often tests positive for rheumatoid factor. The skin lesions described are not characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Rheumatoid Arthritis</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Gout : Usually presents with acute onset of severe pain, redness, and swelling, often in the first metatarsophalangeal joint (big toe). It does not typically involve silvery, scaly plaques or have a family history of psoriasis.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Gout</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Ankylosing Spondylitis : Primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints rather than the peripheral joints like the DIP joints. It also does not present with psoriasis or skin plaques as described.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

B) Total Laryngectomy with Neck Dissection.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The clinical presentation (hoarseness of voice, weight loss) and the laryngoscopic findings (ulceroproliferative growth with fixed vocal cord) suggest advanced glottic carcinoma. The fixed vocal cord indicates at least T3 stage, as it suggests tumor infiltration into the paraglottic space or fixation due to deeper invasion. Weight loss in an elderly patient further supports an advanced stage malignancy.</li><li>\u2022 This is the preferred treatment for T3 or T4 laryngeal cancers, especially when the vocal cords are fixed, and there is a high likelihood of regional spread. If the patient has significant lymph node involvement or is symptomatic (e.g., weight loss), a neck dissection is warranted along with total laryngectomy.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Radical Radiotherapy: Radical radiotherapy is usually preferred for early-stage laryngeal cancers (T1 or T2) with mobile vocal cords. It is less effective for advanced stages (T3 or T4) due to higher chances of recurrence.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Radical Radiotherapy:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy alone is not the primary treatment for advanced laryngeal carcinoma unless the patient is unsuitable for surgery or radiation. It is primarily used for palliative care or in cases with distant metastasis.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Chemotherapy:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Concurrent Chemoradiation: Concurrent chemoradiation is a consideration for organ preservation in advanced laryngeal cancers. However, for patients with a fixed vocal cord and significant weight loss, total laryngectomy provides better local control and survival outcomes.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Concurrent Chemoradiation:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 For advanced glottic carcinoma with vocal cord fixation (T3/T4) and evidence of regional spread, the best treatment option is Total Laryngectomy with Neck Dissection.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
