Ts is a syndrome affecting multiple organ systems. Other features of ts include benign growths in the nervous system, eyes, heart, lungs, liver, and skin. This patient is having multiple cysts And the cysts are large There is also the risk of developing renal cell carcinoma and angiomyolipoma. Hence the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is because the other options like autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease do not have the risk of developing renal cell carcinoma Other common symptoms of tuberous sclerosis include angiomyolipomas</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease This kidney disease also has multiple cysts but unlike tuberous sclerosis, there is no risk of developing renal cell carcinoma Option: B. Von- Hippel -Lindau disease Von- Hippel- Lindau disease is an inherited cancer syndrome with renal manifestation Kidney cysts and carcinoma affect the majority of VHL patients, but there is no separate risk of developing renal cell carcinoma Option: D. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney In autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, there is no risk of developing renal cell carcinoma as compared to tuberous sclerosis Here the hallmarks of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease are biliary dysgenesis due to a primary duct malformation with associated periportal fibrosis namely congenital hepatic fibrosis</p>\n<p></p>",
