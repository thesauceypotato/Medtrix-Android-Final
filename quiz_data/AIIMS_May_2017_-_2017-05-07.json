This allows the esophagus to traverse from the thoracic cavity to the abdominal cavity.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Oesophagus:</li><li>\u2022 Option B . Aorta : The descending (thoracic) aorta carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the lower parts of the body.

Oligospermia: The low levels of FSH result in impaired spermatogenesis, often leading to oligospermia or azoospermia.

The fornix is a white matter bundle located in the medial aspect of the cerebral hemispheres which arises from the hippocampus and ends in the mamillary body of the hypothalamus. It connects various nodes of a limbic circuitry and is believed to play a key role in cognition and episodic memory recall. Fornix is an example of association fiber and is supplied by the anterior cerebral artery. The hippocampus is a seahorse-shaped structure located within the temporal lobes of the brain. The fornix originates from the hippocampus. Specifically, it receives input from the hippocampus and sends axons that project back to the hippocampus. This loop of connections is involved in memory formation and retrieval.</li><li>\u2022 The above image is the cross-section of the human brain in which the marked arrow indicates the fornix.</li><li>\u2022 The fornix is a white matter bundle located in the medial aspect of the cerebral hemispheres which arises from the hippocampus and ends in the mamillary body of the hypothalamus.</li><li>\u2022 It connects various nodes of a limbic circuitry and is believed to play a key role in cognition and episodic memory recall.</li><li>\u2022 Fornix is an example of association fiber and is supplied by the anterior cerebral artery.</li><li>\u2022 The hippocampus is a seahorse-shaped structure located within the temporal lobes of the brain.

It does have connections to the splenium of the corpus callosum, especially for the transfer of visual information between the hemispheres. This connection allows the brain to process visual information from both eyes and integrate it into a cohesive visual experience.
