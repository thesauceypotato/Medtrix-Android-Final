As a result, the hand hangs in a flexed position, and the fingers appear to be in a semi-flexed state. There may also be sensory loss on the dorsal aspect of the hand.</li><li>\u2022 Option B) Radial nerve -</li><li>\u2022 Option C) Median nerve - Median nerve injury can result in a deformity known as \"ape hand\" or \"Benediction hand.\" In this condition, the patient is unable to flex the thumb, index finger, and middle finger at the MCP joints. These fingers remain extended and do not participate in a grip. The thumb also remains in an extended and abducted position. This deformity resembles an ape's hand or the hand of someone making a blessing gesture (hence the term \"Benediction hand\").</li><li>\u2022 Option C) Median nerve -</li><li>\u2022 Option D) Posterior interosseous nerve - The posterior interosseous nerve is a branch of the radial nerve, and injury to it can result in a specific deformity known as \"finger drop\" or \"pointing finger.\" In this condition, the patient is unable to extend the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and interphalangeal (IP) joints, except for the thumb. The thumb remains functional. When trying to extend the fingers, they remain flexed at the MCP and IP joints, giving the appearance of pointing.</li><li>\u2022 Option D) Posterior interosseous nerve -</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective</li><li>\u27a4 Injury to the ulnar nerve (known as ulnar nerve palsy), can result in Claw hand.</li><li>\u27a4 In ulnar claw hand, the patient is unable to extend the fourth and fifth fingers (ring and pinky fingers) at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints while the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are hyperextended. This creates a claw-like appearance of the hand. Additionally, there may be a loss of sensation along the ulnar side of the hand.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

In view of her history of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in IVF, the answer is OHSS Theca lutein cysts are enlarged cysts seen in molar pregnancy PCOS is a risk factor for OHSS, in view of the history, OHSS is a more appropriate answer Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is characterized by multiple ovarian follicular cysts accompanied by increased capillary permeability and leakage of intravascular fluid to the third space. It is commonly seen after exogenous administration of FSH, LH or HCG injections. Bilateral ovaries are enlarged and show presence of multiple follicular cysts The OHSS risk is high in women with PCOS with high AMH, high AFC Or with history of previous high response. Risk can be reduced using antagonist protocol with GnRH agonist trigger . The mainstay of management is conservative. The ongoing stimulation cycle is suspended, and further administration of exogenous gonadotropins is stopped in that cycle. Severe OHSS can also cause ascites, pleural effusion, liver dysfunction, raised hematocrit (>55%), oliguria, thromboembolic phenomenon etc. and must be managed conservatively.</li><li>\u2022 The image is a transvaginal ultrasound showing the ovaries which appear significantly enlarged.</li><li>\u2022 In view of her history of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in IVF, the answer is OHSS</li><li>\u2022 Theca lutein cysts are enlarged cysts seen in molar pregnancy</li><li>\u2022 PCOS is a risk factor for OHSS, in view of the history, OHSS is a more appropriate answer Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is characterized by multiple ovarian follicular cysts accompanied by increased capillary permeability and leakage of intravascular fluid to the third space.
