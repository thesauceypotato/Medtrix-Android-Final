It may be focal (affecting only one muscle) or diffuse . ISOLATED DYSTONIAS A)Focal, Multifocal, and Segmental Dystonia Onset-Adulthood The major clinical phenotypes are as follows: Cervical dystonia - (most common) dystonic contractions of neck muscles causing the head to deviate to one side ( laterocollis) , twist ( torticollis ), move in a forward direction (anterocollis) , or move in a backward direction ( retrocollis ). Muscle contractions can be painful and occasionally can be complicated by a secondary cervical radiculopathy. Blepharospasm- dystonic contractions of the eyelids with increased blinking that can interfere with reading, watching television, working on a computer, and driving. This can sometimes be severe enough to cause functional blindness. Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) -contractions of muscles of the lower face, lips, tongue, and jaw (opening or closing). Meige\u2019s syndrome is a combination of OMD and blepharospasm that predominantly affects women aged >60 years . Spasmodic dysphonia- dystonic contractions of the vocal cords during phonation, causing impaired speech. Most cases affect the adductor muscles and cause speech to have a choking or strained quality. Less commonly, the abductors are affected, leading to speech with a breathy or whispering quality. Limb dystonias -these can be present in either arms or legs and are often brought out by task-specific activities such as handwriting (writer\u2019s cramp ), playing a musical instrument ( musician\u2019s cramp ), or putting in golf (the yips).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Options B, C, and D are correct.</p>\n<p></p>",

Most commonly begin in the legs but can spread to/ begin in the upper limbs. RLS is associated with periodic leg movements (PLMs) during sleep and occasionally while awake. The restlessness and PLMs are a major cause of sleep disturbance , leading to poor-quality sleep and daytime sleepiness.

Secondary Restless legs syndrome (RLS) - may be associated with Pregnancy Anemia ferritin deficiency renal failure peripheral Tremor, Chorea, and Other Movement Disorders .
