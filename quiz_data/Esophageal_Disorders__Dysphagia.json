Cases are rare with a CD4 count >200 and common when a CD4 count is < 100 . HIV may also be associated with a self-limited syndrome of acute esophageal ulceration with oral ulcers. Regardless of the infectious agent, odynophagia is a characteristic symptom of infectious esophagitis. CMV esophagitis occurs primarily in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV, patients with malignancy, and recipients of bone marrow or organ transplants. CMV is usually activated from a latent stage. On endoscopy, CMV lesions appear as large serpiginous ulcers in normal mucosa, particularly in the distal esophagus. Biopsies from the ulcer bases have the most significant diagnostic yield for finding the pathognomonic large nuclear or cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Immunohistology with monoclonal antibodies to CMV and in situ hybridization tests are helpful for early diagnosis. Treatment studies of CMV gastrointestinal disease have demonstrated the effectiveness of both ganciclovir (5 mg/kg every 12 h IV) and valganciclovir (900 mg orally every 12 h) . Therapy is continued until healing, which may take 3\u20136 weeks. Maintenance therapy may be needed for patients with relapsing disease.

Patients with chest pain or persistent dysphagia, each of which may be indicative of more morbid consequences of GERD or alternative diagnoses. In the case of dysphagia, chronic reflux can lead to the development of a peptic stricture, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), or adenocarcinoma.
