      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1 \u2192 4 \u2192 2 \u2192 3 Cyclins are named such because they undergo a constant cycle of synthesis and degradation during cell division. When cyclins are synthesized, they act as an activating protein and bind to CDKs forming a Cyclin-CDK complex. This complex then acts as a signal to the cell to pass to the next cell cycle phase. CELL CYCLE: G0\u2192 G1\u2192 S\u2192 G2\u2192 M 1st step / ON-OFF SWITCH in cell cycle \u2013 Phosphorylation of Rb gene . Normally, Rb gene is active in hypophosphorylated state . As Rb gene is a tumour suppressor gene , it binds to E2F (Elongation factor) and inhibits transcription of genes whose products are required for Synthetic (S) phase of cell cycle. Phosphorylation of Rb gene leads to release of E2F and leads to transcription of genes whose products are required for Synthetic (S) phase of cell cycle. Cyclins and Cyclin dependent kinases are involved in cell cycle. Cyclin D, Cyclin E, Cyclin A and Cyclin B gets activated sequentially and binds to Cyclin Dependent inhibitors - CDK 4 , CDK2, CDK1 and CDK 1 respectively and completes the cell cycle. Role of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and CDK inhibitors (CDKIs) in regulating the cell cycle. Shaded arrows represent the phases of the cell cycle during which specific Cyclin-CDK complexes are active. Cyclin D-CDK4, Cyclin D-CDK6, and Cyclin E-CDK2 regulate the G1 -to-S transition by phosphorylating the Rb protein (pRb) . Cyclin A-CDK2 and Cyclin A-CDK1 are active in the S phase . Cyclin B-CDK1 is essential for the G2 -to-M transition . Two families of CDK inhibitors can block activity of CDKs and progression through the cell cycle. The so-called INK4 inhibitors, composed of p15, p16, p18, and p19, act on cyclin D-CDK4 and cyclin D-CDK6 . The other family of three inhibitors, p21, p27, and p57, can inhibit all CDKs. CELL CYCLE INHIBITORS Cip/Kip Family : Includes p21 , p27 and p57 . These can bind to Cyclin-CDK and inactivate them INK4/ARF Family: Includes p16INK4a and p14 ARF p16INK4a inhibits CDK4 p14 ARF prevents p53 degradation by inhibiting MDM2 CELL CYCLE CHECKPOINTS: G1/S and G2/M checkpoints. Cell damage caused by Ionising Radiation arrests the cells at G2/M checkpoint After cell cycle arrest at different points, the cell has to activate the DNA repair mechanisms and repair itself and if not, apoptosis has to happen rendering the cell to die.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: 4 \u2192 1 \u2192 3 \u2192 2.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All are correct All the given options are mechanisms of oncogenesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Genes that promote autonomous cell growth in cancer cells are called oncogenes , and their unmutated cellular counterparts are called proto-oncogenes . Oncogenes are created by mutations in proto-oncogenes and encode proteins called oncoproteins that have the ability to promote cell growth in the absence of normal growth-promoting signals . Oncoproteins resemble the normal products of proto-oncogenes but bear mutations that often inactivate internal regulatory elements; consequently, their activity in cells does not depend on external signals . Cells expressing oncoproteins are thus freed from the normal checkpoints and controls that limit growth, and as a result proliferate excessively . Oncogenesis or tumorigenesis , is the formation of a cancer, whereby normal cells are transformed into cancer cells . The process is characterized by changes at the cellular, genetic, and epigenetic levels and abnormal cell division . Transformation of proto oncogenes to oncogenes occurs by all of the following: Point mutation Point mutations can cause the proto-oncogene to become constitutively active or increase its activity, promoting cell proliferation. Promoter insertion In some cases, a promoter sequence, which regulates gene expression, can be inserted near a proto-oncogene. This promoter insertion can lead to increased expression of the proto-oncogene, resulting in abnormal cell growth and the transformation into an oncogene. Amplification Amplification refers to an increase in the number of copies of a proto-oncogene. This can occur due to genetic alterations, such as gene duplications or chromosomal rearrangements . Amplification leads to an elevated expression of the proto-oncogene and can drive uncontrolled cell division and tumor formation. Enhancer insertion Enhancers are DNA sequences that enhance the activity of promoters and contribute to gene regulation. In some cases, an enhancer sequence can be inserted near a proto-oncogene, leading to increased expression of the gene. This enhanced expression can drive abnormal cell growth and the conversion of the proto-oncogene into an oncogene. It's important to note that not all proto-oncogenes undergo transformation into oncogenes, and the mechanisms described above are some of the ways in which this transformation can occur. The development of cancer often involves multiple genetic alterations and the dysregulation of multiple genes and pathways.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Proto-oncogenes and associated tumors: Selected Oncogenes, Their Mode of Activation, and Associated Human Tumors Category Proto-Oncogene Mode of Activation in Tumor Associated Human Tumor Growth Factors PDGF- \u03b2 PDGFB Overexpression Astrocytoma Fibroblast growth factors HSTI Overexpression Osteosarcoma Fibroblast growth factors HSTI FGF3 Overexpression Amplification Osteosarcoma Stomach cancer Bladder cancer Breast cancer Melanoma TGF-\u03b1 TGFA Overexpression Astrocytomas HGF HGF Overexpression Hepatocellular carcinomas Thyroid cancer Growth Factor Receptors EGF-receptor family ERBBI (EGFR) ERBB2 (HER) Mutation Amplification Adenocarcinoma of lung Breast carcinoma FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 FLT3 Point mutation or small duplications Leukemia Receptor for neurotrophic factors RET Point mutation Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A and B, familial medullary thyroid carcinomas PDGF receptor PDGFRB Amplification, translocation Gliomas, leukemias Receptor for KIT ligand KIT Point mutation Gastrointestinal stromal tumors, seminomas, leukemias ALK receptor ALK Translocation Point mutation Adenocarcinoma of lung, certain lymphomas Neuroblastoma Proteins Involved in Signal Transduction GTP-binding (G) proteins KRAS HRAS NRAS GNAQ GNAS Point mutation Point mutation Point mutation Point mutation Point mutation Colon, lung, and pancreatic tumors Bladder and kidney tumors Melanomas, hematologic malignancies Uveal melanoma Pituitary adenoma, other endocrine tumors Nonreceptor tyrosine kinase ABL Translocation Chronic myelogenous leukemia Acute lymphoblastic leukemia RAS signal transduction BRAF Point mutation Melanomas, leukemias, colon carcinoma, others Notch signal transduction NOTCHI Point mutation, translocation Leukemias, lymphomas, breast carcinoma JAK/STAT signal transduction JAK2 Point mutation, translocation Myeloproliferative disorders Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Nuclear Regulatory Proteins Nuclear Regulatory Proteins MYC NMYC Translocation Amplification Burkitt lymphoma Neuroblastoma Cell Cycle Regulators Cyclins CCNDI (cyclin DI) Translocation Amplification Mantle cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma Breast and esophageal cancers Cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4 Amplification or point mutation Glioblastoma, melanoma, sarcoma</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hyper IgM syndrome</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hyper-IgM Syndrome In this disorder, affected patients have IgM antibodies but are deficient in IgG, IgA, and IgE antibodies . Mature B cells are present , but they are incapable of Ig class switching and affinity maturation , because of a defect in CD4+ helper T cells or an intrinsic B-cell defect. It is a group of primary immune deficiency disorders characterized by defective CD40 signaling ; via B cells affecting class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation . Patients with Hyper-IgM (HIGM) syndrome are susceptible to recurrent and severe infections and in some types of HIGM syndrome opportunistic infections and an increased risk of cancer as well. Most of the patients of Hyper IgM syndrome have loss of function mutation involving either CD 40 or an enzyme called activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) . So, B cells can be detected by flow cytometry having low expression of CD 40 . In the Image given, a and b are controls Flow cytometry is used to study multiple antigens at the same time The results are obtained in the form as shown in the questions INTERPRETATION: Each plot has x axis (represents one antigen) and y axis (represents another antigen) Divide the plot into 4 quadrants Hyper IgM syndrome is due to deficiency of CD40 located on the surface of B cells CD40-CD40 ligand interaction is required for isotype switching and affinity maturation .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: Bare lymphocyte syndrome. Bare lymphocyte syndrome is usually caused by mutations in transcription factors that are required for class II MHC gene expression. The lack of class II MHC molecules prevents the development of CD4+ T cells, which are involved in cellular immunity and provide help to B cells; hence, class II MHC deficiency results in combined immunodeficiency . Option B: Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) spans a constellation of genetically distinct syndromes, all having in common defects in both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses . Persons with SCID are extremely susceptible to recurrent, severe infections by a wide range of pathogens, including Candida albicans, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Pseudomonas, cytomegalovirus, varicella, and a host of bacteria. Option D: Chronic granulomatous disease. Defects in leukocytic superoxide production lead to chronic granulomatous disease. Defects in neutrophil function , as in chronic granulomatous disease, lead to increased susceptibility to infections with S. aureus, some gram-negative bacteria, and fungi .</p>\n<p></p>",
