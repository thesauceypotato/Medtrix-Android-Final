These clinical features are suggestive of advanced cervical cancer. The involvement of the lateral parametrium indicates that the cancer has spread beyond the cervix to the surrounding tissues but not to the pelvic wall or the lower third of the vagina, which classifies it as Stage 2B cervical cancer. The standard treatment for Stage 2B cervical cancer is chemoradiation, which combines chemotherapy with radiation therapy. This approach aims to enhance the effectiveness of the treatment, reduce tumor size, and prevent further spread of the cancer.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

The most commonly involved artery in pseudoaneurysm formation is the femoral artery, due to its superficial location and frequent use for arterial access. Pseudoaneurysms can also occur in other arteries, such as the brachial, radial, ulnar, and carotid arteries. Common causes of pseudoaneurysm formation include trauma, iatrogenic injury during medical procedures (e.g., arterial catheterization), and underlying arterial disease (e.g., atherosclerosis). The clinical presentation of a pseudoaneurysm may include a pulsatile mass, pain, tenderness, and signs of bleeding or hematoma formation. The diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm is confirmed by imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scan, or angiography. Treatment options for a pseudoaneurysm may include observation, compression, percutaneous thrombin injection, or surgical repair depending on the size, location, and underlying cause of the lesion.

Alcian blue stains these acidic mucins blue, allowing for their clear visualization under the microscope. However, it does not stain neutral mucins, making it highly specific for detecting acidic mucin types in tissues. This staining is particularly useful in diagnosing mucinous lesions in the gastrointestinal tract and other organs where acid mucins are prevalent.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.
