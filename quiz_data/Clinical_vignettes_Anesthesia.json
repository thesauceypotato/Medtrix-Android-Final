Endobronchial intubation: Endobronchial intubation (misplacement of the endotracheal tube into one mainstem bronchus) primarily results in ventilation of only one lung. This typically causes hypoxemia and increased peak inspiratory pressures due to reduced lung compliance, but it would not directly lead to a significant decrease in EtCO 2 unless there were profound hypoperfusion or impaired CO 2 delivery, which is not evident here.</li><li>\u2022 B. Excessive expiratory time: Excessive expiratory time is unlikely to cause low EtCO 2 . In mechanical ventilation, prolonging the expiratory phase primarily affects lung dynamics, such as reducing air trapping or improving gas exchange. It does not lead to hyperventilation or significantly reduced EtCO 2 unless accompanied by other factors like high minute ventilation or low perfusion.</li><li>\u2022 D. Low cardiac output: While low cardiac output is a common cause of reduced EtCO 2 , this patient is not described as hemodynamically unstable or in shock, and there is no evidence of reduced perfusion (e.g., hypotension or poor oxygenation). Additionally, the normal body temperature indicates an absence of severe blood loss or metabolic compromise that could lead to significant low cardiac output. Therefore, this explanation is less likely than excessive tidal volume in the given scenario.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

The patient was maintained in an upright sitting position. The anesthesia was induced via a 25 G Quincke cutting needle inserted at L4-5 interspinous space. The subarachnoid space was at a depth of about six cms from the skin surface, and it was confirmed by the presence of clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dripping from the needle. The syringe containing the recommended standard dose of hyperbaric bupivacaine was attached to the spinal needle. The anesthesiologist overlooked the step to re-aspirate CSF into the needle and proceeded with the intrathecal administration of the drug. After completion of the injection, blood-tinged fluid dripped from the back of the spinal needle. Early in labor, the patient suddenly developed hypotension and was immediately administered with a suitable vasopressor. Soon after, the ECG showed an abnormal rhythm.

The ICU team has been having difficulties managing the ventilator as the plateau pressure has been reading consistently over 35 cmH2O. The ventilator mode is volume assist control. Changes are made to the ventilator to reduce auto-PEEP by decreasing the tidal volume and reducing the respiratory rate. Arterial blood gas shows pH 7.26, pCO2 54 mmHg, and pO2 76 mmHg.
