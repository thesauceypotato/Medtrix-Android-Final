However, vandalism, deceit/theft, and physical aggression are not features of a narcissistic personality disorder. Instead, patients have fantasies of unlimited success, power, and/or wealth, and a pathological need for praise. Option: C. A patient with a conduct disorder would have a history of vandalism, theft/deceitful conduct, and/or physical/verbal aggression, as well as an onset of such behavior before the age of 15 years. A conduct disorder is also more commonly diagnosed in males. However, a conduct disorder cannot be diagnosed in an individual above the age of 18 years once the criteria for a different but related disorder have been met. Option: D. Patients with an oppositional defiant disorder may have workplace issues and a history of expulsion from school. However, such problems stem from difficulties with authority figure s (e.g., bosses, and teachers) and not from a heightened sense of self-importance . Also, physical aggression, vandalism, and theft/deceit are not features of an oppositional defiant disorder.</p>\n<p></p>",

In addition, the individual would have a pattern of disregard for the rights of others without any remorse, as well as a history suggesting conduct disorder during adolescence. Option: B. Patients with dependent personality disorder have an intense need to be taken care of and a fear of abandonment . However, aggressive behavior and self-harm are not features of a dependent personality disorder. Instead, patients tend to be submissive in relationships and tend to urgently seek a new relationship once a relationship fails to avoid feeling alone and helpless. Option: D.
