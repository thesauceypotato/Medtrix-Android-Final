Uptake of this compound followed by further breakdown occurs in the cells. Tumor cells have a high metabolic rate, and hence this compound is also metabolized by tumor cells. FDG is metabolized to FDG-6-phosphate which cannot be further metabolized by tumor cells, and hence it accumulates and concentrates in tumor cells. This accumulation is detected and quantified.

DWI - Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a form of MR imaging based upon measuring the random Brownian motion of water molecules within a voxel of tissue.

Diffusion is particularly useful in tumor characterization and cerebral ischemia. Option: B. BOLD - Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) imaging is the standard technique used to generate images in functional MRI (fMRI) studies, and relies on regional differences in cerebral blood flow to delineate regional activity Option: C. FLAIR - Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is a special inversion recovery sequence with a long inversion time. This removes signal from the cerebrospinal fluid in the resulting images 1. Brain tissue on FLAIR images appears similar to T2 weighted images with grey matter brighter than white matter but CSF is dark instead of bright.
