Vomiting: Severe vomiting that precedes the onset of pain, leading to esophageal rupture. Dyspnea or Shortness of Breath: Due to leakage of air and fluids into the chest cavity, causing pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Subcutaneous Emphysema: Air leaks from the esophagus into the chest wall, causing a characteristic crackling sensation when the skin is palpated. Shock: Severe cases may lead to shock due to sepsis or hypovolemia. Hamman's Sign: A crunching or rasping sound synchronous with the heartbeat, heard over the precordium or left lateral chest wall on auscultation, caused by heartbeats displacing air-filled tissues. Abdominal Pain and Tenderness: Especially if the perforation is near the lower part of the esophagus.
