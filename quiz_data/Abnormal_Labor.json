However, fetal parts are not palpable outside the uterus in this condition. Option C: Obstructed labor occurs when the baby cannot progress through the birth canal despite strong contractions. It does not typically present with abdominal pain and bleeding unless it leads to a secondary complication like uterine rupture. Option D: A cervical laceration can cause significant vaginal bleeding, but it usually occurs during the passage of the baby through the birth canal, often in the second stage of labor or during delivery.

Given the symptomatology of severe chest pain and shortness of breath along with tachycardia, pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading concern. Pregnancy and the postpartum period increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), making PE a more likely complication in this context. A CTPA is the most appropriate and definitive test for diagnosing a PE as it allows direct visualization of the pulmonary arteries to detect any emboli.</li><li>\u2022 The symptoms of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and tachycardia in a postpartum woman can be alarming and suggest a cardiovascular or pulmonary origin.

It usually presents with mild to moderate dyspnea and occasionally tachypnea.  Atelectasis is typically not associated with severe chest pain. A chest X-ray is the standard imaging modality for identifying atelectasis but given the severity of the symptoms, atelectasis is less likely to be the primary issue here. Option C: Postpartum pneumonia could present with shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, and a productive cough. A sputum culture can be helpful in identifying the causative organism if pneumonia is suspected. However, pneumonia is generally less likely to present so acutely with severe chest pain and without other respiratory infection symptoms like fever and cough. Option D: Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a form of heart failure that can occur during the last month of pregnancy or the months following delivery. It can present with shortness of breath, fatigue, and signs of heart failure. An echocardiogram is used to diagnose this condition by assessing the heart's function and structure. While peripartum cardiomyopathy can cause dyspnea and tachycardia, the sudden onset of severe chest pain is less characteristic of this condition.</li><li>\u2022 Option B: Atelectasis involves collapse of part of the lung and is common after anesthesia or due to immobility.

Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition that can occur during labor or after delivery. It's characterized by a sudden onset of hypotension, respiratory distress, and coagulopathy, often accompanied by neurological symptoms such as confusion or seizures due to an embolic event. The diagnosis is clinical and one of exclusion. There's no specific treatment, so supportive care is critical. This includes maintaining oxygenation and hemodynamic support, as well as addressing any coagulopathy that may arise.</li><li>\u2022 The clinical presentation of a sudden drop in blood pressure, tachycardia, and confusion after delivery with a firm uterus and no active bleeding is suggestive of a non-hemorrhagic shock, which does not fit with the typical signs of postpartum hemorrhage or uterine rupture.</li><li>\u2022 Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition that can occur during labor or after delivery.

The clinical signs would typically include a drop in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate. However, the uterus may often be atonic, although it can be firm in cases of retained placental fragments or genital tract tears. Initial treatment would focus on identifying the source of bleeding and managing it with uterotonics, repair of any lacerations, and blood transfusions if necessary. Option C: DIC is a secondary condition that can occur as a complication of several obstetric emergencies, such as severe PPH, sepsis, or AFE. It's characterized by activation of clotting in the small blood vessels throughout the body, which can lead to a paradoxical increase in bleeding due to the consumption of clotting factors and platelets. Treatment is primarily focused on treating the underlying cause and supporting the coagulation system with blood products as necessary. Option D: Uterine rupture involves a tear in the wall of the uterus and is typically accompanied by severe abdominal pain, loss of fetal station, and sometimes vaginal bleeding. The uterus would not be described as firm in such a case. If the rupture is complete, there would often be signs of fetal distress or even maternal hemodynamic instability if there is significant intra-abdominal bleeding. Surgical repair is necessary for uterine rupture, and it's an obstetric emergency that requires immediate intervention.</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is characterized by heavy bleeding of more than 500 mL after vaginal delivery or 1000 mL after cesarean delivery.
