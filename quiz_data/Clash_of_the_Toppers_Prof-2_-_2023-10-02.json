Ivabradine - Funny current blocker for treatment of decreased visual acuity</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation of all the options:</li><li>\u2022 A) Zavegepant - CGRP receptor antagonist used for the treatment of acute migraine attacks: This is a correct match. Zavegepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist. It is used for the treatment of acute migraine attacks. CGRP is a neuropeptide that plays a role in the pathophysiology of migraines, and antagonists like Zavegepant block its activity, thereby alleviating symptoms.</li><li>\u2022 B) Pembrolizumab \u2013 Immune check point inhibitor used for endometrial carcinoma: This is also a correct match. Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets the PD-1 receptor. It is used for a variety of cancers, including endometrial carcinoma, especially in cases that are MSI-H or dMMR (microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient).</li><li>\u2022 C) Ertugliflozin \u2013 SGLT2 inhibitor for treatment of diabetes mellitus: This is another correct match. Ertugliflozin is a Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which is used to manage blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus. It works by inhibiting the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, thereby leading to the excretion of glucose in the urine.</li><li>\u2022 D) Ivabradine \u2013 Funny current blocker for treatment of decreased visual acuity: This is the incorrect match. Ivabradine is indeed a \"funny\" current (If) blocker, but it is used for the treatment of certain types of chronic heart failure and angina pectoris (chest pain), not for treating decreased visual acuity.</li><li>\u2022 Therefore, option D is not a correct match concerning the mechanism of action and clinical use of the given drug.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
