      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>I.V Lorazepam+ thiamine Chronic alcoholics if they suddenly leave alcohol, they will go into spontaneous withdrawal state. Withdrawal symptoms can range from tremors, seizures, psychosis to Delirium tremens. In the given case as patient is delirious and having visual hallucinations (seeing snakes) it is suggestive of Delirium tremens (DT). DOC for delirium tremens is benzodiazepines.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Delirium tremens (DTs ) is the most serious withdrawal state and occurs 1\u20133 days after alcohol cessation, so is commonly seen 1\u20132 days after admission to hospital. Patients are disorientated and agitated and have a marked tremor and visual hallucinations (e.g. insects or small animals). Signs include sweating, tachycardia, tachypnea and pyrexia. Complications include dehydration, infection, hepatic disease or the Wernicke\u2013Korsakoff\u2019s syndrome</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Chronic alcoholics are having deficiency of thiamine; giving concurrent thiamine is also recommended in almost every case. Option C. As this patient is in delirious and semiconscious state, oral benzodiazepines can be risky route of administration. Option D. Low dose haloperidol is DOC for management of delirium due to non-alcohol related causes.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Management of delirium tremens (DTs) General measures Admit the patient to a medical bed Correct electrolyte abnormalities and dehydration Treat any co- morbid disorder (e.g. infection) Given parenteral thiamine slowly (250 mg daily for 3-5 days) in the absence of Wernicke \u2013 Korsakoff\u2019s syndrome Give parenteral thiamine slowly (500 mg daily for 3-5 days) with Wernicke \u2013 Korsakoff\u2019s encephalopathy. Note: Beware anaphylaxis Give prophylactic phenytoin or carbamazepine, if there is a previous history of withdrawal fits Specific drug treatment Give one of the following orally: Diazepam 10-20 mg Chlordiazepoxide 30-60 mg Repeat 1 h after the last dose, depending on response Fixed \u2013 schedule regimens Diazepam 10 mg every 6 h for 4 doses, then 5 mg- 6-hourly for 8 doses OR Chlordiazepoxide 30 mg every 6 h for 4 doses, then 15mg 6 \u2013 hourly for 8 doses Provide additional benzodiazepine when symptoms and signs are not controlled</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>General anesthesia and get muscle relaxation Succinylcholine and thiopentone has no role in mood elevation or decreasing the seizure threshold. As patient goes to ECT room, wait there and lie down on ECT table, so he remembers that he was given ECT. Except for the period when he was anesthetized, he is not having memory but that is with all anesthetized patients and is not different for ECT patient.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The techniques used for ECT administration are of two types: Direct ECT : Without anesthesia Modified ECT : With anesthesia. All precautions and preparation of general anesthesia are followed. E.g. PAC fitness obtained. Given after an overnight fast .i.e. empty stomach If given at any other time during the day, the patient should be empty stomach for at least 4 hours. Intravenous line secured. Atropine (0.6 mg) is given IV just before the treatment or else is given IM or SC 30 minutes before treatment. (Atropine is given to decrease the oral secretions). An anesthetic mask is placed on the face and ventilation with 100% oxygen is given This step is followed by administration of an anaesthetic agent such as propofol (0.75\u20132.5 mg/kg) or thiopentone (2-5 mg/kg, usually individualized dose for each patient) and a muscle relaxant like succinylcholine (0.5-1.5 mg/kg).</p>\n<p></p>",
