Admit to hospital; intensive care setting may be necessary for frequent monitoring, if pH <7.00, labored respiration, or impaired level of arousal. Assess: Serum electrolytes (K+, Na+, Mg2+, Cl-, bicarbonate, phosphate) Acid-base status-pH, HCO\u2083, PCO\u2082, B-hydroxybutyrate Renal function (creatinine, urine output) Replace fluids: 2-3 L of 0.9% saline or lactated Ringer's over first 1-3 h (10-20 mL/kg per hour); subsequently, 0.45% saline at 250-500 mL/h; change to 5% glucose and 0.45% saline or lactated Ringer's at 150-250 mL/h when blood glucose reaches 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L). Administer short-acting regular insulin: IV (0.1 units/kg), then 0.1 units/kg per hour by continuous IV infusion; increase two- to threefold if no response by 2-4 h. If the initial serum potassium is <3.3 mmol/L (3.3 meq/L), do not administer insulin until the potassium is corrected. Subcutaneous insulin may be used in uncomplicated, mild-moderate DKA with close monitoring. Assess patient: What precipitated the episode (noncompliance, infection, trauma, pregnancy, infarction, cocaine)? Initiate appropriate workup for precipitating events (cultures, CXR, ECG, etc.). Measure blood glucose every 1-2 h; measure electrolytes (especially K+, bicarbonate, phosphate) and anion gap every 4 h for the first 24 h. Monitor blood pressure, pulse, respirations, mental status, fluid intake and output every 1-4 h. Replace K: 10 meq/h when plasma K+ <5.0-5.2 meq/L (or 20-30 meq/L of infusion fluid), ECG normal, urine flow and normal creatinine documented; administer 40-80 meq/h when plasma K+ <3.5 meq/L or if bicarbonate is given. If initial serum potassium is >5.2 mmol/L (5.2 meq/L), do not supplement K+ until the potassium is corrected. See text about bicarbonate or phosphate supplementation. Continue above until the patient is stable, glucose goal is 8.3-11.1 mmol/L (150-200 mg/dL), and acidosis is resolved. Insulin infusion may be decreased to 0.02-0.1 units/kg per hour. Administer long-acting insulin as soon as the patient is eating. Allow for a 2- to 4-h overlap in insulin infusion and SC long-acting insulin injection.</p>\n<p></p>",
