The age of the injury can be determined, which helps to corroborate the alleged time of the In open wounds, dirt, dust, grease, or sand are usually present, which may connect the injuries to the scene of the crime.

When a person is knocked down by a motor car, the pattern of the radiator grille, a headlamp rim, or the tread of the tire may be seen on the skin, which may contain road dirt, paint flakes, grease, etc. Impact by a solid object may produce abrasion at the periphery where the skin is forced downwards.

Grazes (sliding, scraping, or grinding abrasion):- are the most common type. They occur when there is movement between the skin and some rough surface in contact with it.

The furrow may be broad at one end, and narrow in the opposite direction. Usually, the skin is uniformly denuded at the start or may be serrated. The epidermis is scraped away, destroyed, or detached. A glancing kick with a boot also produces a graze. These abrasions are commonly seen in road accidents. It is a scraping injury over a large area. \"Friction burn\" (scuff or brush abrasion) is an extensive, superficial, reddened excoriated area without serous ooze or bleeding and with little or no linear mark. It may occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface or when the skin is covered by clothing. Brush bums and friction bums are seen in motorcyclists, persons ejected from vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists thrown forward after the primary impact from a motor vehicle. If a victim is struck with a glancing blow with a rough object, such as a stone or a stick, a brush bum will be caused.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Patterned abrasion Impact abrasions and pressure abrasions reproduce the pattern of the object causing it and are called patterned abrasions. Patterned injury is any injury that suggests an inflicting instrument or unique means of its causation. Patterned abrasions are produced when the force is applied at a right angle to the surface of the If the skin is struck with a weapon having a patterned surface, or the body falls against a patterned surface, the abrasion of the epidermis is caused by the ridges of the object, if it has a profile of varying height. The skin may be compressed into the cavities of the pattern with capillary damage leading to an intradermal bruise, e.g., when a motor tire passes over the skin. Other examples of patterned abrasion are imprints of bicycle chains, weaves of coarse fabrics, the spiral of electric wires, ropes, serrated knives, etc. Multi-thronged whip, such as a cat-o-nine-tails, leaves a series of linear abrasions or superficial tears. Usually, the pattern and shape are non-specific.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option A: Patterned Bruising: A patterned contusion is one in which the size and shape mirror a portion of the object which caused it. With heavier impacts or objects, the tissues beneath the impacting objects are crushed, and the contusion pattern is solid rather than outlined Option C: Impact Abrasions (contact or imprint abrasions): They are caused by impact with a rough object when the force is applied at or near a right angle to the skin surface. The abrasion is slightly depressed below the surface unless there is bulging due to underlying contusion or local edema. If the impact is forcible, the dermis is damaged with an underlying bruise.

If a person strikes a flat and relatively smooth surface, an abrasion can be produced which shows little or no linear markings, as in traffic accidents. Option D: Stretch Lacerations: Overstretching of the skin, if it is fixed, will cause lacerations. There is localized pressure with a pull which increases until tearing occurs and produces a flap of skin, which is peeled off the underlying bone or deep fascia. This is seen in the running over by a motor vehicle, and the flap may indicate the direction of the vehicle.</p>\n<p></p>",
