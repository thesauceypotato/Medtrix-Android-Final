The role of prolactin around ovulation is less pronounced compared to its surge after delivery, where it is critical for initiating and sustaining lactation.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 24 hours after ovulation</li><li>\u2022 Option C. NREM Sleep : Prolactin levels naturally rise during sleep, especially during the deeper stages of NREM sleep, due to reduced dopamine activity, which normally inhibits prolactin secretion. Despite this increase, the levels achieved during sleep are usually not as high as those observed after childbirth, where prolactin plays a direct and significant role in breastfeeding.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. NREM Sleep</li><li>\u2022 Option D. After running for 1 hour : Physical activities and stress can lead to an increase in prolactin levels as part of the body's response to physiological stress or exertion. However, these increases are generally transient and significantly lower than the sustained high levels required for lactation post-delivery.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

As the night progresses and sleep deepens, dopamine levels decrease, leading to a decrease in the inhibition of prolactin release. Consequently, prolactin levels rise, reaching their peak in the early morning hours.</li><li>\u27a4 Prolactinoma: The most common cause of hyperprolactinemia is a noncancerous tumour of the pituitary gland called a prolactinoma.</li><li>\u27a4 Prolactinoma:</li><li>\u27a4 Medications: Certain medications can increase prolactin levels. These include antipsychotic (such as risperidone and haloperidol), antidepressants, anti-nausea drugs (such as metoclopramide), and some high blood pressure medications.</li><li>\u27a4 Medications:</li><li>\u27a4 Hypothyroidism: Underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) can disrupt the normal balance of hormones in the body, including prolactin regulation.</li><li>\u27a4 Hypothyroidism:</li><li>\u27a4 Chronic Kidney Disease: Kidney dysfunction or chronic kidney disease can lead to hyperprolactinemia.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. D. Secondary active transport</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 Glucose is absorbed into the intestine by secondary active transport because this process allows for the efficient uptake of glucose against its concentration gradient.</li><li>\u2022 Secondary active transport involves the coupled movement of two substances across a membrane, where the movement of one substance is dependent on the electrochemical gradient created by the movement of another substance. In the case of glucose absorption in the intestine, the secondary active transport mechanism relies on the sodium gradient created by the sodium-potassium pump.</li><li>\u2022 The process of glucose absorption in the intestine occurs in the brush border membrane of the intestinal epithelial cells, specifically in the small intestine. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how secondary active transport facilitates glucose absorption:</li><li>\u2022 Sodium-Potassium Pump: The sodium-potassium pump actively transports sodium ions (Na+) out of the epithelial cells and into the intercellular space, using ATP energy. This creates a concentration gradient where the sodium concentration is higher outside the cell. Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter: The sodium gradient generated by the sodium-potassium pump is utilized by a specific protein called the sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT). This cotransporter binds both sodium ions and glucose molecules on the outer surface of the cell. Co-transport of Sodium and Glucose: As sodium ions bind to the SGLT protein, their movement into the cell down the concentration gradient provides the necessary energy for the simultaneous movement of glucose against its concentration gradient. Glucose is \"dragged\" along with the sodium ions as they enter the cell. Glucose Transporter: Once inside the epithelial cell, glucose is transported across the basolateral membrane (the inner surface of the cell) and into the bloodstream by facilitated diffusion through a specific glucose transporter called GLUT2.</li><li>\u2022 Sodium-Potassium Pump: The sodium-potassium pump actively transports sodium ions (Na+) out of the epithelial cells and into the intercellular space, using ATP energy. This creates a concentration gradient where the sodium concentration is higher outside the cell.</li><li>\u2022 Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter: The sodium gradient generated by the sodium-potassium pump is utilized by a specific protein called the sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT). This cotransporter binds both sodium ions and glucose molecules on the outer surface of the cell.</li><li>\u2022 Co-transport of Sodium and Glucose: As sodium ions bind to the SGLT protein, their movement into the cell down the concentration gradient provides the necessary energy for the simultaneous movement of glucose against its concentration gradient. Glucose is \"dragged\" along with the sodium ions as they enter the cell.</li><li>\u2022 Glucose Transporter: Once inside the epithelial cell, glucose is transported across the basolateral membrane (the inner surface of the cell) and into the bloodstream by facilitated diffusion through a specific glucose transporter called GLUT2.</li><li>\u2022 Overall, the energy stored in the sodium gradient created by the sodium-potassium pump is used to actively transport both sodium and glucose into the intestinal epithelial cells. This secondary active transport mechanism allows for the absorption of glucose from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream efficiently, even when the concentration of glucose is higher inside the cell than in the lumen.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Primary active transport : Incorrect because primary active transport involves the direct use of ATP to move substances against their gradient, which does not apply to glucose absorption in this context.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Primary active transport</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Facilitated diffusion : Incorrect as this method does not involve the active transport of glucose against its concentration gradient; it only allows movement along the gradient.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Facilitated diffusion</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Simple diffusion : Incorrect because simple diffusion does not involve any transport proteins and occurs only along the concentration gradient, which is not sufficient for glucose absorption in the intestine.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Simple diffusion</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Glucose absorption in the intestine occurs via secondary active transport, utilizing the energy from the sodium gradient created by the sodium-potassium ATPase to transport glucose against its concentration gradient.

This binding opens ligand-gated Na\u207a channels, allowing an influx of sodium ions, which depolarizes the muscle membrane and generates an action potential. The action potential travels along the motor neuron to the axon terminal, where it triggers the opening of voltage-gated Ca\u00b2\u207a channels. The entry of calcium ions into the axon terminal facilitates the exocytosis of Ach into the synaptic cleft, which then binds to receptors on the muscle fiber to propagate the signal for muscle contraction.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

This phase represents the transition from storage to voiding phase. Voiding Phase (or Micturition Phase): In the voiding phase, the intravesical pressure rises to its highest level as the detrusor muscle contracts forcefully to empty the bladder.

During this period, the application of even a stronger stimulus will not elicit an action potential.</li><li>\u2022 Point 2 to 4</li><li>\u2022 The refractory period is divided into two, an absolute refractory period and a relative refractory period. During the absolute refractory period, the nerve will not be excited no matter how strong a stimulus is given. However, during the relative refractory period, stronger than normal stimuli can cause excitation.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A : Incorrect.

At point E, the nerve is not more excitable; rather, it is in a hyperpolarized state where more than the normal stimulus would be needed to generate another action potential.</li><li>\u2022 Option B</li><li>\u2022 Option C : Incorrect.
