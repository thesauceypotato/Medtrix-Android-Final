It is the most common congenital anomaly of kidneys. This has increased in people with chromosomal defects such as Turner\u2019s and Down\u2019s syndrome. The Horseshoe kidney is a congenital anomaly of the formation of kidneys. The symptoms include frequent UTIs, nausea, foul-smelling urine, etc. The patient complains of pain on the left side of the abdomen because of the mild ischemia of the left side of the transverse and descending colon. This is because the ascent of the kidney to its normal position is interrupted by the inferior mesenteric artery (the isthmus of the horseshoe kidney is the blockage), and the artery is compressed.

Pancreatitis may start suddenly and last for days or occur over many years. It has many causes, including gallstones, heavy alcohol use, etc. The symptoms include upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Since the pain is elicited on the left side and MRI doesn\u2019t indicate it, the answer is wrong. Option: D. Annular pancreas is a congenital defect of the joining of the ventral and dorsal heads of the pancreas. The symptoms include early satiety and nausea due to duodenal atresia.

It is a hereditary disease that affects the lungs and the digestive system. Here, the body produces thick and sticky mucus that clogs the lungs, obstructs the pancreas, and prevents them from secreting essential chemicals and hormones. Cystic fibrosis affecting the pancreas will prevent the secretion of pancreatic lipase and amylase.

The leading cause of infertility in men with cystic fibrosis is the congenital absence of the vas deferens (which usually connects the testes to the ejaculatory ducts of the penis), but potentially also by other mechanisms such as causing no sperm, abnormally shaped sperm, and few sperm with poor motility. Many men found to have congenital absence of the vas deferens during evaluation for infertility have a mild, previously undiagnosed form of CF. Around 20% of women with CF have fertility difficulties due to thickened cervical mucus or malnutrition. In severe cases, malnutrition disrupts ovulation and causes a lack of menstruation.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Nephrolithiasis Nephrolithiasis is also known as renal calculi, and it is a disease that also affects the urinary tract. Kidney stones are small deposits made of calcium, phosphate, and other components of foods that build up in the kidneys. They usually result in hematuria. Nephrolithiasis is also known as renal calculi, and it is a disease that also affects the urinary tract. They usually result in hematuria. They are typically diagnosed by ultrasound, intravenous pyelography (IVP), or a CT scan, along with blood tests that indicate an increased calcium and urea content. Hence, it is the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Renal pain: The renal pain is felt in the loin and often radiates downward and forward into the groin. The nature of pain varies from dull aches to severe spasmodic pain. The renal pain occurs either due to stretching of the renal capsule or due to spasms of the smooth muscle in the renal pelvis. The afferent fibers pass successively through the renal plexus, lowest splanchnic nerve, and sympathetic trunk and enter the T12 spinal segment. The pain is commonly referred to along the subcostal nerve to the flank and anterior abdominal wall and the ilioinguinal nerve (L1) into the groin.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Pyelonephritis is the inflammation of the kidney that is usually due to a bacterial infection. The symptoms include fever, tenderness, nausea, burning sensation while urinating, and frequent urination. It doesn\u2019t increase blood calcium content. Hence, it is the wrong answer. Option: C. Renal tumors are abnormal growths in the kidney. These masses may be benign or malignant. They mainly don\u2019t elevate the blood urea level. They also don\u2019t elicit sharp pain. Hence, it is the wrong answer. Option: D. Renal infarction results from an interruption in the regular blood supply to part of or to the entire kidney. The two major causes of renal infarction are thromboembolism and in situ thrombosis. They don\u2019t increase the blood urea and calcium level, but they increase LDH levels. Hence, it is the wrong answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Referred pain - Excessive distension of the ureter or spasm of its muscle can be caused by a stone (calculus) and provokes severe pain (ureteric colic, which is commonly, but mistakenly, called renal colic). The pain is spasmodic and agonizing, particularly if the obstruction is gradually forced down the ureter by the muscle spasm. It is referred to cutaneous areas innervated from spinal segments that supply the ureter, mainly T11\u2013L2, and shoots superomedially down to the scrotum or labium majus; it can extend into the proximal anterior aspect of the thigh by projection to the genitofemoral nerve (L1, L2). The cremaster with the same innervation may retract the testis reflexly.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pheochromocytoma The patient suffers from a rare adrenal medulla tumor known as a It causes increased catecholamine synthesis and abnormal division of the chromaffin cells. Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of adrenal medullary tissue wherein the chromaffin cells are enlarged. Hence, it is called chromaffin oma. It results in the excessive release of epinephrine and norepinephrine. The symptoms include flushing of the skin, high blood pressure, sweating, dizziness, fatigue, palpitations, headache, anxiety, nausea, shortness of breath, tremors, and weight loss. The catecholamines are broken down rapidly and are excreted in the urine as Vanillyl Mandelic Acid (VMA) at an increased level than usual.

Attacks are random and may occur secondary to a trigger or spontaneously after a catecholamine surge.

Patients require immediate, life-saving treatment to prevent further damage to other organs and death.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Familial dysautonomia is a genetic disorder that affects the development, differentiation, and survival of certain nerve cells. This disorder disturbs cells in the ANS. Hence, involuntary activities like digestion, breathing, lacrimation, and regulating blood pressure and body temperature are altered to a varied extent. Since the patient doesn\u2019t present with any structural and functional deformities, the answer is wrong. Option: C. Adrenal cysts are rare cystic masses that arise from the adrenal medullary interstitium. They are generally non-functional, and asymptomatic when smaller than 10 cm in diameter. There is no marked increase in the VMA levels in the urine. Hence, it is the wrong answer. Option: D. Adrenal cortical carcinoma is a rare disease wherein neoplastic cells are formed in the outer layer of the adrenal gland known as the adrenal cortex. This condition usually presents with a lump on the back and is generally associated with diabetes. There is no significant rise in the VMA levels in the urine. Hence, it is the wrong answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The signs and symptoms of pheochromocytoma are those related to sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity.
