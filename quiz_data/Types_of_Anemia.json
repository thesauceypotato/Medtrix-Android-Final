G6PD deficiency is a recessive X-linked trait, placing males at much higher risk for symptomatic disease . G6PD mutations cause protein misfolding and breakdown , making it easier for red blood cells to break. As red blood cells age , the G6PD variants become less effective at protecting against oxidative stress , making older cells more likely to break than younger ones. The episodic hemolysis that is characteristic of G6PD deficiency is caused by exposures that generate oxidant stress. The most common triggers are infections, drugs implicated are numerous, including antimalarials (e.g., primaquine and chloroquine), sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin , and others. The most frequently cited food is the fava bean, which generates oxidants when metabolized called \u201cFavism\u201d . When G6PD deficient RBCs are exposed to high levels of oxidants , reactive sulfhydryl groups on globin chains cross-link and form Heinz bodies , and dark inclusions are seen in stained red blood cells. These Heinz bodies can damage the red blood cell membrane and cause intravascular hemolysis or reduced red blood cell flexibility . As the damaged cells pass through the spleen , macrophages remove the Heinz bodies , resulting in some cells retaining a \u2018bitten\u2019 appearance or becoming spherocytes due to loss of membrane surface area . Both types of damaged cells are then removed by phagocytes. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: effects of oxidant drug exposure (peripheral blood smear).

With time, however, chronic erythrocytosis leads to splenic infarction, fibrosis, and progressive shrinkage, so that by adolescence or early adulthood only a small nubbin of fibrous splenic tissue is left, a process called auto splenectomy . Thus splenectomy is often not required .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Sickle cell anemia is a common hereditary hemoglobinopathy caused by a point mutation in \u03b2-globin that promotes polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin , leading to red cell distortion, hemolytic anemia, microvascular obstruction, and ischemic tissue damage.

Sickling can be reversible and irreversible, which is true because sickling in sickle cell anemia is a reversible process that occurs in response to low oxygen levels in the blood. However, repeated episodes of sickling and unsickling can cause damage to the red blood cells and lead to irreversibly sickled cells. Option: D. The high prevalence of sickle cell trait in certain African populations stems from its protective effects against falciparum malaria, this is true because sickle cell trait, which is a carrier state for the sickle cell gene, is more common in certain African populations due to its protective effects against falciparum malaria .

Impaired \u03b2-globin synthesis results in anemia by two mechanisms. The deficit in HbA synthesis produces \u201cunderhemoglobinized\u201d hypochromic, microcytic red cells with subnormal oxygen transport capacity. Even more important is the diminished survival of red cells and their precursors , which results from the imbalance in \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin synthesis. Unpaired \u03b1 chains precipitate within red cell precursors, forming insoluble inclusions . These inclusions cause a variety of untoward effects, but membrane damage is the proximal cause of most red cell pathology. In severe \u03b2-thalassemia , ineffective red blood cell production leads to various issues. The excessive demand for red blood cells results in the overgrowth of these cells in the bone marrow , causing skeletal abnormalities. Abnormal blood cell production also occurs outside the bone marrow, affecting organs like the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes . This can lead to masses forming in the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Furthermore, the active blood cell production competes for nutrients with other deprived tissues, causing severe cachexia in untreated patients. Pathogenesis of B-thalassemia major. Note that the aggregates of unpaired a-globin chains, a hallmark of the disease, are not visible in routinely stained blood smears.

Duodenal epithelial cell uptake of heme and nonheme iron is described in the text. When the storage sites of the body are replete with iron and erythropoietic activity is normal, plasma hepcidin balances iron uptake and loss to and maintains iron homeostasis by downregulating ferroportin and limiting iron uptake (middle panel). Hepcidin rises in the setting of systemic inflammation or when liver iron levels are high, decreasing iron uptake and increasing iron loss during the shedding of duodenocytes (right panel). Conversely, hepcidin levels fall in the setting of low plasma iron, primary hemochromatosis, or ineffective hematopoiesis (left panel), leading to a rise in iron absorption. DMTI, Divalent metal transporter I. Hepcidin: Iron absorption in the duodenum is regulated by hepcidin, a small circulating peptide that is synthesized and released from the liver in response to increases in intrahepatic iron levels. Hepcidin inhibits iron transfer from the enterocyte to plasma by binding to ferroportin , causing ferroportin to be endocytosed and degraded . As a result, as hepcidin levels rise , iron becomes trapped within duodenal cells in the form of mucosal ferritin and is lost as these cells slough . Ferroportin: It is a transmembrane protein that transports iron from the inside of a cell to the outside of the cell . Ferroportin is the only known iron exporter . Ferritin: The ferritin blood test measures how much iron is stored in a person\u2019s body.

Earliest hematologic evidence of response to treatment is an increase in Reticulocytes % & Hb content . Maximal reticulocyte % is on the 5th to 10th day after the institution of therapy & thereafter returns to normal. Maximum value usually ranges from 5 to 10% and is inversely related to the level of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin level is the most accurate measure of the degree of anemia in iron deficiency .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Iron transport: Regulation of iron absorption. Duodenal epithelial cell uptake of heme and nonheme iron is described in the text. When the storage sites of the body are replete with iron and erythropoietic activity is normal, plasma hepcidin balances iron uptake and loss to and maintains iron homeostasis by downregulating ferroportin and limiting iron uptake (middle panel). Hepcidin rises in the setting of systemic inflammation or when liver iron levels are high, decreasing iron uptake and increasing iron loss during the shedding of duodenocytes (right panel). Conversely, hepcidin levels fall in the setting of low plasma iron, primary hemochromatosis, or ineffective hematopoiesis (left panel), leading to a rise in iron absorption. DMTI, Divalent metal transporter I. Hepcidin: Iron absorption in the duodenum is regulated by hepcidin, a small circulating peptide that is synthesized and released from the liver in response to increases in intrahepatic iron levels. Hepcidin inhibits iron transfer from the enterocyte to plasma by binding to ferroportin , causing ferroportin to be endocytosed and degraded . As a result, as hepcidin levels rise , iron becomes trapped within duodenal cells in the form of mucosal ferritin and is lost as these cells slough . Ferroportin: It is a transmembrane protein that transports iron from the inside of a cell to the outside of the cell . Ferroportin is the only known iron exporter . Ferritin: The ferritin blood test measures how much iron is stored in a person\u2019s body. Elevated ferritin concentration is considered a marker for high body iron stores .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Restoration of enzymes.

Iron incorporation into heme is impaired, leading to microcytosis (small red cells) and anemia . Protoporphyrin is an intermediate in the pathway of heme synthesis. Lead inhibits heme synthesis by inhibiting ALA synthetase When heme synthesis is impaired, protoporphyrin accumulates within the red cell . This reflects an inadequate iron supply to erythroid precursors to support hemoglobin synthesis. Normal values are < 30 g/dL of red cells. In iron deficiency, values in excess of 100 g/dL are seen. The most common causes of increased red cell protoporphyrin levels are iron deficiency & lead poisoning . Blood and marrow changes occur fairly rapidly and are characteristic. The inhibition of ferrochelatase by lead may result in the appearance of a few ring sideroblasts , red cell precursors with iron-laden mitochondria that are detected with a Prussian blue stain.

Marrow aspirates often yield little material (a \u201cdry tap\u201d) ; hence, aplasia is best appreciated in marrow biopsies . Other nonspecific pathologic changes are related to granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, such as mucocutaneous bacterial infections and abnormal bleeding, respectively. Aplastic anemia (bone marrow biopsy). Markedlyhypocellular marrow contains mainly fat cells. (A) Low power. (B) High power.

Four inherited bone marrow failure syndromes associated with aplastic anemia : Fanconi anemia (FA) Dyskeratosis congenital (DC) Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT) Fanconi anemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by defects in a multiprotein complex that is required for DNA repair. Marrow hypofunction becomes evident early in life and is often accompanied by multiple congenital anomalies , such as hypoplasia of the kidney and spleen, and bone anomalies, commonly involving the thumbs or radii.
