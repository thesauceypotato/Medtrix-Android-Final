      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Causes non inflammatory diarrhoea Symptoms of this patient suggest a diagnosis of Guillain Barre syndrome which commonly Occurs after infection of Campylobacter jejuni. It causes inflammatory Diarrhoea. Campylobacter jejuni is a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium that grows best in a high temperature (42 degrees C, or 107 degrees F) and low oxygen environment. These characteristics represent adaptations to growth in its normal habitat\u2014the intestine. Symptomatic infection occurs almost exclusively in infants and young children, who can be infected repeatedly. Subsequent infections tend to be asymptomatic, making symptomatic disease rare in older children or adults. To culture, this bacteria charcoal-based media like Butzler, and Skirrow is used. Infection is typically established in the lower intestines and colon, and initially causes noninflammatory diarrhoea. This is followed by a locally invasive stage that leads to cell damage and intestinal inflammation (dysentery), stomach cramps, and severe diarrhoea Campylobacter infections can cause extraintestinal diseases involving the neurologic, pulmonary, immunologic and cardiac systems . The main recognized sequelae are Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), reactive arthritis (REA), and post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (P-IBS).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Guillain-Barre syndrome is caused by Campylobacter jejuni which is a gram-negative rod. Option C.

Option D. jejuni is a motile, with a single polar flagellum gram-negative rods with a comma, S or \u201cgull-wing\u201d shapes and they do not form spores.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a rare condition in which a person's immune system attacks the peripheral nerves.

When an infant consumes C botulinum spores, the bacteria can germinate in the gastrointestinal tract. Bacteriolysis releases botulinum toxin, which is absorbed systemically and blocks the release of acetylcholine from cholinergic presynaptic terminals .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Constipation is usually the first manifestation of infant botulism, followed days to weeks later by mild weakness, lethargy, and reduced feeding. In rare, severe cases, infants can have weakened suckling and crying, diminished gag reflex, and symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis with loss of head control that can cause the infant to appear \"floppy.\" In contrast, adult botulism usually results from the ingestion of preformed toxins (eg, contaminated canned foods) and is almost always very severe.

Option B. Serum viral tilers are frequently used in the evaluation of patients with viral hepatitis or suspected Epstein-Barr or cytomegalovirus infections. Poor feeding with loss of extremity muscle tone is more characteristic of infant botulism. Option D: Allergic proctocolitis in infants can present after the introduction of different food groups, and the diagnosis can be supported by stool studies that are positive for gross or occult blood. However, these infants usually appear well despite persistent diarrhoea and/or rectal bleeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Wound botulism results from the contamination of a wound with the bacteria, which then secrete the toxin into the bloodstream.

Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a rod-shaped, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and nonmotile bacterium . Diphtheria toxin is an exotoxin secreted by Corynebacterium, the pathogenic bacterium that causes diphtheria. Diphtheria produces diphtheria toxin, a protein that inhibits protein synthesis in susceptible eukaryotic cells. Diphtheriae will synthesize diphtheria toxin as 5% of its total protein . The tox gene is regulated by a mechanism of negative control wherein a repressor molecule, a product of the DtxR gene, is activated by iron. Must Remember - Iron concentration: Toxin production depends on optimum iron concentration (0.1 mg per litre). Higher levels of iron inhibit toxin synthesis by up-regulating the DT repressor gene in the bacterial chromosome.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Diphtheria toxin: mode of action Same as P. aeruginosa Exotoxin A ADP-ribosyl transferase Inactivates elongation factor 2 Inhibits host protein synthesis</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Diphtheriae toxin is a heat-liable, single-chain, three-domain polypeptide that can be lethal in a dose of 0.1mg/kg body weight. The abrupt arrest of protein synthesis is responsible for the necrotizing and neurotoxic effects of diphtheria toxin. Option C. Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a non-motile, non-sporing, non-capsular bacteria. It is 0.5-1.0 mg in diameter and several micrometres long. Characteristically they possess irregular swellings at one end that give them a club-shaped appearance. Option D.
