      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>MRI of the brain This patient has 2 different types of headache, one of which is likely a migraine (eg, infrequent, unilateral throbbing pain, mild nausea, improvement with rest ) that has been unchanged for years , and a new type that is different (eg, Bifrontal headache on awakening ) and associated with concerning symptom s (eg, nausea and vomiting, blurry vision). This patient's new headache and her associated symptoms are worrisome for elevated intracranial pressure (eg, from mass effect) and should be evaluated early with an MRI of the brain to determine the cause.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Warning signs that suggest a serious underlying disorder: should lead to the consideration of early imaging: Neurologic findings Sudden-onset headache First severe headache \u201cWorst\u201d headache ever Vomiting that precedes headache Subacute worsening over days or weeks Pain induced by bending, lifting, coughing Pain that disturbs sleep or presents immediately upon awakening Known systemic illness Onset after age 55 Fever or unexplained systemic signs Abnormal neurologic examination Pain associated with local tenderness g., region of temporal artery Seizure changes in consciousness Differences compared to prior headaches Change in frequency, intensity, characteristics sudden onset trauma</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A.Gradual withdrawal of analgesics -However, this patient gives no indication that she is overusing analgesics , and rebound headaches are unlikely to cause daily bifrontal headaches with nausea, vomiting, and blurry vision . Option: C. Topiramate and as-needed sumatriptan- As needed sumatriptan with prophylactic topiramate would be appropriate in a patient suffering from frequent migraines , but this patient's new headache is different from her prior ones and warrants further evaluation first. Option: D.Inhaled oxygen and prophylactic verapamil - would be appropriate for a patient with cluster headaches .</p>\n<p></p>",
