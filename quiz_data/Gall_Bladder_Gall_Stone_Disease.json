Murphy's sign , where tenderness is exacerbated during inspiration by palpation in the right sub-costal region, is a characteristic feature of acute cholecystitis.

If the inflammation does not subside, the gallbladder may develop empyema, and the wall may become necrotic and perforate, causing localized peritonitis .

CT scan is inferior to ultrasonography in diagnosing gallstones but is similar in sensitivity for acute cholecystitis. Gallstones are occasionally identified on abdominal CT scans as part of a broader workup of abdominal pain. Option: D . The primary use of biliary scintigraphy is in diagnosing acute cholecystitis, which appears as a non-visualized gallbladder, with prompt filling of the common bile duct and duodenum.

Bouveret\u2019s syndrome usually presents with non-specific symptoms, most commonly a triad of epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. It could also present with abdominal pain, distension, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, fever, weight loss, and anorexia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Bouveret's Syndrome is caused by a gallstone obstructing the duodenum, typically in the bulb area. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Diagnosis can be made through imaging studies such as CT scans or X-rays. Treatment options include duodenostomy and pyloroplasty . Duodenostomy involves creating an opening in the duodenum to bypass the obstruction, while pyloroplasty involves widening the opening between the stomach and small intestine. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to avoid complications such as bowel perforation and infection.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Mirizzi\u2019s syndrome: The impaction of a large stone in the neck of the gallbladder obstructing the level of the confluence of the cystic duct and common hepatic duct is called Mirizzi\u2019s syndrome. Option: C. Murphy\u2019s sign - In the acute phase, the patient may have right upper quadrant tenderness exacerbated during inspiration by the examiner\u2019s right subcostal palpation.

Courvoiser\u2019s sign : A palpable, non-tender gallbladder is called Courvoisier\u2019s sign. Suppose the gallbladder is palpable in a jaundiced patient. In that case, it is unlikely to be due to gallstones because stones would have given rise to chronic inflammation and, subsequently, fibrosis of the gallbladder, rendering it incapable of dilatation.</p>\n<p></p>",

Patients with severe obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure may not tolerate the increased intraabdominal pressures of pneumoperitoneum with carbon dioxide and may require an open cholecystectomy. Previously thought to be relative contraindications, conditions such as acute cholecystitis, gangrene and empyema of the gallbladder, biliary-enteric fistulae, obesity, pregnancy, ventriculoperitoneal shunts, cirrhosis, and previous upper abdominal procedures are now considered risk factors for a potentially difficult cholecystectomy, but they do not necessarily preclude laparoscopy. Conversion to an open operation should always remain an option and not be considered a failure.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. COPD is a relative contraindication to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Option: B . Liver Cirrhosis is a relative contraindication to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Option: C. Cholangitis is a relative contraindication to laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In the elective setting, conversion to an open procedure is needed in about 5% of patients. Emergent procedures or patients with complicated gallstone disease can be more challenging, and the incidence of conversion is between 10% and 30%. It is important to discuss the possibility of conversion to open with the patient before surgery.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Rigler's triad The characteristic radiological sign of gallstone ileus is Rigler\u2019s triad, comprising: small bowel obstruction, pneumobilia, and an atypical mineral shadow on radiographs of the abdomen. Image showing Rigler\u2019s Sign And Rigler\u2019s Traid.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Gallstone ileus can be diagnosed through the presence of Rigler's triad on radiographs of the abdomen Rigler's triad is composed of small bowel obstruction, pneumonia, and an unusual mineral shadow If two of these signs are present , it is considered pathognomonic of gallstone ileus and can be seen in 40-50% of cases Pneumobilia is a common finding after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Charcot\u2019s triad is the presence of classic symptoms of fever, epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice in Cholangitis. Option: C. The \u201cMercedes-Benz sign\u201d describes a triradiate pattern of nitrogen gas within gallstones initially described on an abdominal radiograph in cases of calculus cholecystitis. Option: D. The Mercedes Benz sign, also known as the seagull sign, refers to the typical triradiate pattern seen on imaging performed for diagnosing gallstones.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The treatment for gallstone ileus typically involves laparotomy The stone should be milked proximally away from the site of impaction It may be possible to crush the stone within the bowel lumen, but if not, the intestine should be opened at this point to remove the gallstone If the gallstone is faceted, a careful check for other enteric stones should be made The region of the gallbladder should not be explored.</p>\n<p></p>",
