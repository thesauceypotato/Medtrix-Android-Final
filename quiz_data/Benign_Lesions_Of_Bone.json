The level of PGE2 is reduced after the injection of steroids. PGE2 is believed to stimulate the osteoblasts to resorb the bone.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Simple/Solitary/ Unicameral-Bone Cyst This lesion is also considered a developmental or reactive lesion than a true tumor Features Mostly occurs during first two decades of life. Males>Females.. Arise in juxta physeal metaphysis and sometimes extends upto diaphysis but never cross physis to involve epiphysis and joint. Most common site proximal humerus (50%) and femur (25%). In adult ilium and calcaneum are more common locations Activity of the UBC can be judged on the x-ray by measuring the distance between the cyst and the physis. Active - Distance between the cyst and the physis less than 1 cm. b. Latent - Distance between the cyst and physis 1 cm These are most active during skeletal growth and heal spontaneously at maturity less than1 mm It is a true cyst (lined by epithelium) Fluid contains high level of PG-E2 Than the physis, minimal or no X Ray: Cyst is central, purely lytic lesion with a well marginated outline smaller periosteal reaction and most important is Fallen leaf (fallen fragment) sign which is pathognomic x-ray finding. Fallen leaf (fragment) sign Aspirate contain clear serous fluid unless there is a pathological fracture Treatment: aspiration and injection steroid, bone marrow or sclerosants are used. Curretage and bone grafting is also treatment option.(contraindicated in active lesion). Radiotherapy is contraindicated</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Elevated levels of prostaglandin PGE2 in the fluid aspirated from the radiologically active unicameral bone cyst, Not Aneurysmal bone cyst Option: B. An elevated level of prostaglandin PGE2 in the fluid aspirated from the radiologically active unicameral bone cyst, Not hydatid cyst Option: D. An elevated level of prostaglandin PGE2 in the fluid aspirated from the radiologically active unicameral bone cyst, Not Fibrous cortical cyst</p>\n<p></p>",
