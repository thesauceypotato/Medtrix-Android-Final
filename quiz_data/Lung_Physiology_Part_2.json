Green colour blood is seen in a rare condition known as sulfhemglobinemia Methemoglobinemia is a disorder characterized by the presence of a higher-than-normal level of methemoglobin (metHb, i.e., ferric [Fe3+] rather than ferrous [Fe2+] haemoglobin) in the blood. Methemoglobin is a form of haemoglobin that contains ferric [Fe3+] iron and has a decreased ability to bind oxygen. However, ferrous iron has an increased affinity for bound oxygen.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>a. Dapsone b. Bismuth nitrates c. Antibiotics (trimethoprim, sulfonamides and dapsone), d. Local Anesthetics (especially articaine and prilocaine), e. Aniline dyes, f. Metoclopramide Normal blood (left) and chocolate-colored blood of methemoglobinemia (right). Symptoms Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia (methemoglobin >1%) include shortness of breath, cyanosis, mental status changes, headache, fatigue, exercise intolerance, dizziness and loss of consciousness. Arterial blood with elevated methemoglobin levels has a characteristic chocolate-brown colour (LQ 2012) as compared to normal bright red oxygen-containing arterial blood. In advanced cases hypotension, dysrhythmias, seizures, coma and death can occur. Treatment Methemoglobinemia can be treated with supplemental oxygen and methylene blue</p>\n<p></p>",
