      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>B, D Statement: B is true: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of lactational infections. Fifty percent of infants harbour staphylococci in the nasopharynx. A cracked nipple might initiate mastitis and blocked lactiferous ducts with stagnant milk will allow organisms to multiply, leading to breast abscess. Early recognition and treatment with antibiotics, such as flucloxacillin or comoxiclav , can prevent abscess formation. Once the abscess is formed, the pus should be aspirated under ultrasound guidance. Some patients will require a mini- incision and drainage. MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) infections can sometimes occur, particularly if the infection is hospital-acquired. Statement: D is true: Phyllodes tumours are usually single, unilateral, painless palpable breast masses. On clinical examination, the phyllodes tumours feel firm and well-circumscribed like fibroadenoma and might be slightly larger when first detected. It is impossible to differentiate smaller phyllodes tumours from fibroadenomas Features that alert a clinician to a phyllodes tumour include the following: Older age of the patient Larger tumour size History of rapid growth Phyllodes tumo u r is classified as benign, intermediate and The degree of stromal cellular atypia, mitotic activity per 10 high-power fields, presence or absence of stromal overgrowth (defined as a single 40 times field of pure stroma devoid of epithelium), infiltrative or expansile margins are the criteria used to subclassify phyllodes as benign, borderline, or malignant .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Phyllodes tumour is a rare (< 1% of all breast tumours), large(>3cm), rapidly growing, discrete and firm painless breast lump. They are usually benign, but most of them have malignant potential. They originate from the hormonally responsive stromal cells of the breast. Clinical features Large breast with an unevenly bosselated surface. Pressure necrosis may cause skin ulceration. They are mobile on the chest wall Mostly seen in 40\u201350 years (premenopausal) age. Phyllodes tumours are fibroepithelial tumours composed of epithelial and stromal components. Biopsy shows a leaf-like appearance under the microscope.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Statement: A is false: Nipple retraction might be noticed during puberty when the breasts develop and the aetiology is unknown. This might cause difficulty in breastfeeding due to retained secretions. Recent retraction of nipple, particularly in older women, might be of considerable pathological significance. A slit-like retraction might be caused by duct ectasia and chronic periductal mastitis, whereas a circumferential nipple retraction is likely to be due to a malignancy. Statement: C is false : Fibroadenomas are not associated with a high risk of malignancy. They are offered excision if they are large or have suspicious cytology or when a patient desires to have them removed.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases the risk of breast cancer. Statement A is true: Long-term use of combined preparation of HRT does significantly increase the risk of developing breast cancer. The effect is substantially greater for oestrogen and progesterone combinations than for other types of HRT.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B is false: Inflammatory breast cancer is not related to infection. It is a rare, aggressive type of breast cancer , presenting with swelling, redness, warmth and pain in the breast with oedema . It mimics cellulitis or abscess, but the findings are due to blocked subdermal lymphatics with tumour cells. The presence of cancer cells in the subdermal lymphatics confirms the diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer. They used to be rapidly fatal, but with recent advances in systemic therapy, the prognosis has improved considerably. Option: C is false: Medullary carcinomas are rare breast cancers that have characteristic histopathological findings that show solid sheets of large cells with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. They are often oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) negative. Medullary cancers, despite having an aggressive histological picture and being triple negative, often have a better prognosis than infiltrating duct carcinoma not of an otherwise specified type. Option: D is false: Women with ER-negative breast cancers should not be offered hormone manipulation. Oestrogen receptor expression is the main indicator of potential response to endocrine therapy. Approximately 70% of breast cancers are ER-positive and therefore hormone dependent. Premenopausal ER patients are treated with tamoxifen, which competes with oestrogen to block the oestrogen receptor selectively.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Tamoxifen reduces the risk of contralateral breast cancer. Tamoxifen has been used widely in the hormonal management of breast cancer for more than four decades. Along with its intended benefit to reduce the recurrence rate and death from breast cancer, it also significantly reduces the risk of contralateral breast cancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hormonal therapy Hormonal therap y is an important treatment option for patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. There are several types of hormonal therapy available, including: Ovarian suppression or ablation : This can be achieved through surgical removal of the ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy) or by using medications such as LHRH agonists (Goserelin, Leuprorelin) to suppress ovarian function. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs): Tamoxifen and raloxifene are examples of SERMs that block the effects of estrogen in breast tissue. Aromatase inhibitors: Non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors, such as letrozole and anastrozole , and steroidal aromatase inhibitor exemestane , are used to block the production of estrogen. Anti-estrogens: Fulvestrant is an example of an anti-estrogen drug that binds to estrogen receptors and causes their degradation. Progestins: Megestrol and Medroxyprogesterone acetate are progestin drugs that can be used in combination with other hormonal therapies to increase their effectiveness.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Adjuvant chemotherapy is increasingly being offered to high-risk post-menopausal women. Gene signatures are increasingly used to tailor systemic therapy based on the recurrence scores. Option: C. The results of various studies comparing CMF versus anthracycline-containing regimens suggest a modest advantage for anthracycline regimens. The inclusion of taxanes further improves disease-free survival and overall survival. Hence, CMF is no longer considered adequate for adjuvant therapy. Option: D. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was initially used to downsize locally advanced tumours to facilitate surgery. It was then used in operable breast cancer to decrease the tumour size to facilitate breast conservation. However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has no additional advantage over disease-free survival or overall survival when compared with standard adjuvant therapy.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Lymphoedema in the arm after treatment usually indicates a recurrence. Lymphoedema of the arm is a troublesome complication of breast cancer treatment that can occur anytime from months to years after treatment. The incidence of lymphoedema is significantly higher when axillary dissection is combined with axillary radiation. It is less seen now as axillary dissection and radiotherapy to the axilla are rarely combined. Besides, sentinel lymph node biopsy has been widely adopted as the standard of care in clinically node-negative axilla.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Radiotherapy after implant-based reconstructions can lead to fibrosis and capsular contracture surrounding the implant, resulting in unacceptable results. Implant-based reconstruction after the chest wall has been treated with radiotherapy is also associated with several problems. Delayed or poor wound healing can occur due to the effects of radiotherapy. Autologous reconstructions are a better option if radiotherapy to the chest wall is anticipated. Option: C. Chemotherapy should be avoided in the first trimester, but it appears to be safe in the second and third trimesters. Therefore, chemotherapy might be administered as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy in the second or third trimester. Option: D. Stage for determining, the treatment and prognosis of male breast cancer is similar to female breast cancer. Male breast cancer accounts for <1% of all breast cancers.</p>\n<p></p>",
