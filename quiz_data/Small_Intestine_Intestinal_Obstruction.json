Individuals with a positive family history of Down's syndrome have an increased risk of the disease. Hirschsprung\u2019s disease is a type of neurocristopathy that results from the defective migration of neural crest cells to the colonic mucosa. The disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric ( Auerbach\u2019s ) and submucosal ( Meissner\u2019s ) plexus, with hypertrophy of nerve trunks in the plexus.

Meckel diverticulum is a true diverticulum that may contain ectopic gastric mucosa and/or pancreatic tissue. Acid secretion by gastric mucosa within the diverticulum results in ileal ulceration and subsequent bleeding. Consequently, chronic blood loss can lead to iron deficiency anemia, and thus a low MCV, as seen in this patient.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Meckel's Diverticulum Meckel's Diverticulum is the most commonly encountered congenital anomaly of the small intestine and occurs in 2% of the population. The \"Rule of Two\" in Meckel's Diverticulum refers to its 2% prevalence, 2-inch length, location 2 feet proximal to the ileocecal valve, and the fact that half of those who are symptomatic are under 2 years of age. Meckel's Diverticulum is a true diverticulum as it has all three layers of the intestine and is located on the antimesenteric border of the ileum 45 to 60 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. Meckel's Diverticulum results from incomplete closure of the omphalomesenteric or vitellointestinal duct and is characterized by the presence of heterotopic tissue, with gastric mucosa being the most common (50%), followed by pancreatic mucosa (5%) and colonic mucosa (rarely). The most common clinical presentation of Meckel's Diverticulum is gastrointestinal bleeding (25-50% ), which is manifested as painless bright red blood from the rectum , with intermittent episodes persisting without treatment. Meckel's Diverticulum can also cause intestinal obstruction (31%), diverticulitis (10-20%), perforation, and peritonitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Plain abdominal x-ray showing a double bubble sign is suggestive of duodenal atresia. This girl does not present with bilious vomiting or abdominal distention, which would be expected in this condition. Additionally, she is 15 months old and therefore past the window in which duodenal atresia would manifest (24\u201348 hours after birth). Option: B. Cobblestone mucosa (due to linear ulcerations of the mucosa) is a classical colonoscopic finding of Crohn\u2019s disease (CD). Although intestinal blood loss in CD can cause iron deficiency anemia and a low MCV, as seen in this patient, this condition is associated with further symptoms such as nonbloody chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and failure to thrive. Moreover, since the peak incidence of CD is 15\u201335 years, it is unlikely in this 15-month-old patient. Option: C. In young children, abdominal ultrasound showing a target sign is suggestive of intussusception. While intussusception can cause lower gastrointestinal bleeding, it usually presents with acute cyclical colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal tenderness. This patient has a benign abdominal exam and no concomitant symptoms, making intussusception unlikely.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Scintigraphy with sodium 99mTc-pertechnetate is the most accurate diagnostic test in children, while barium studies should be performed in adults with normal nuclear medicine findings.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Necrotizing enterocolitis Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common cause of an acute abdomen in premature infants with low birth weight. It typically occurs 2\u20134 weeks after birth, once oral feeding has begun. Infants present with poor feeding, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, hematochezia, thrombocytopenia, and/or a distended abdomen with decreased bowel sounds, all of which are present in this infant. The x-ray of the abdomen shows pneumatosis intestinalis, which confirms the diagnosis of NEC. Other typical X-ray findings include dilated bowel loops, portal venous gas, and abdominal free air (if bowel perforation occurs). The presence of abdominal tenderness, rigidity, guarding, and leukocytosis in this patient suggest peritonitis and necrotic bowel, which requires emergent laparotomy and likely resection of the affected bowel to prevent the progression of bowel necrosis, DIC, and shock.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Necrotizing enterocolitis NEC is a condition that affects around 10% of premature infants in NICUs who have been fed for a few days or more. Breastfed infants are less likely to develop NEC than those fed with formula. NEC usually involves the colon and terminal ileum, and less commonly the jejunum and duodenum. Symptoms of mild NEC include feed intolerance, bilious aspirates, distension, and rectal bleeding. Treatment for mild NEC may include gut rest, antibiotics, and parenteral nutrition. Surgical intervention may be necessary if there is tenderness and signs of sepsis, or if the infant's condition worsens. Observation may be appropriate for a short time in some cases. The most seriously ill infants may have a mortality rate of around 30%. Radiological signs of NEC may include pneumatosis intestinalis, gas in the portal vein, and, if perforated, a pneumoperitoneum. Definitive surgery may involve bowel resection and anastomosis or a defunctioning stoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Hirschsprung disease can present with abdominal distention, bilious emesis, and an inability to pass stool secondary to obstruction from an aganglionic portion of the rectosigmoid colon. Failure to pass meconium for > 48 hours and a positive squirt sign further supports this diagnosis. If the disease is complicated by enterocolitis, explosive bloody diarrhea is common. This patient developed symptoms > 2 weeks after delivery, which makes another diagnosis more likely. Moreover, an abdominal x-ray of Hirschsprung disease would show an absence of gas in the distal colon with a dilated bowel proximally rather than the pneumatosis intestinalis is seen here. Option: B. Meckel diverticulum is the most likely cause of painless hematochezia in children < 2 years old. Patients are often asymptomatic but may present with abdominal pain and hematochezia in case of infection, secondary volvulus, or bowel obstruction due to secondary intussusception. Meckel diverticulum cannot be visualized on a plain abdominal x-ray but requires a technetium-99m pertechnetate scan and is not associated with pneumatosis intestinalis. Therefore, another diagnosis is more likely in this child. Option: C . Duodenal atresia presents with abdominal distention, bilious emesis, and a prenatal history of polyhydramnios (since the fetus cannot drink the amniotic fluid due to the intestinal obstruction) but does not cause bloody diarrhea or peritonitis (i.e., abdominal rigidity and guarding).

Meckel diverticulum is the most common pathologic lead point causing intussusception. A pathological lead point should always be suspected in children older than 5 years of age who present with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, especially if symptoms occur within 6 months of the last episode. Meckel diverticulum can cause bleeding if it contains ectopic gastric mucosal cells that secrete gastric acid and can so irritate the adjacent small bowel to the point of ulceration, which explains this child's anemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Meckel's Diverticulum Meckel's Diverticulum is the most commonly encountered congenital anomaly of the small intestine and occurs in 2% of the population. The \"Rule of Two\" in Meckel's Diverticulum refers to its 2% prevalence, 2-inch length, location 2 feet proximal to the ileocecal valve, and the fact that half of those who are symptomatic are under 2 years of age. Meckel's Diverticulum is a true diverticulum as it has all three layers of the intestine and is located on the antimesenteric border of the ileum 45 to 60 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. Meckel's Diverticulum results from incomplete closure of the omphalomesenteric or vitellointestinal duct and is characterized by the presence of heterotopic tissue, with gastric mucosa being the most common (50%), followed by pancreatic mucosa (5%) and colonic mucosa (rarely). The most common clinical presentation of Meckel's Diverticulum is gastrointestinal bleeding (25-50% ), which is manifested as painless bright red blood from the rectum , with intermittent episodes persisting without treatment. Meckel's Diverticulum can also cause intestinal obstruction (31%), diverticulitis (10-20%), perforation, and peritonitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Intestinal adhesions may cause bowel obstruction or act as a pathologic lead point for intussusception. They usually form after abdominal surgery, intra-abdominal inflammation, or abdominal radiotherapy, none of which are mentioned in this patient's history. Option: C. Acute appendicitis presents with diffuse, continuous abdominal pain migrating from the periumbilical region to the right lower quadrant, vomiting, and target sign on ultrasound, making it an important differential diagnosis for this patient's symptoms. However, repeated attacks of pain and the presence of anemia in this patient suggest a different diagnosis. Option: D. Malrotation with volvulus typically presents with acute onset of abdominal pain and bloody stools. On abdominal ultrasound, the classic feature of volvulus is the whirlpool sign (whirl sign), which indicates a twisted mesentery and is easily distinguished from the target sign seen in this patient. Although the clinical features may be similar to those of this patient's condition, volvulus caused by malrotation of the intestines usually occurs during early infancy and would be uncommon in a 6-year-old child.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Scintigraphy with sodium 99mTc-pertechnetate is the most accurate diagnostic test in children, while barium studies should be performed in adults with normal nuclear medicine findings.
