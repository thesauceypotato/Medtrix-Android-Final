Option B & C If the history is good and the CT scan is negative, LP must be performed. Lumbar puncture must not be performed too early as xanthochromia takes time to develop. It is usual to perform LP 12 hours after the onset of the headache. A traumatic tap can cause confusion. Spectrophotometry of CSF is very helpful. A bilirubin peak is diagnostic of SAH.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Hyponatraemia is a frequent complication of SAH, attributed to cerebral salt wasting in the context of fuid depletion and to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion otherwise Fluid restriction is not appropriate in these patients since this risks further compromising perfusion.</p>\n<p></p>",
