The incidence of Barrett's esophagus is rising, and it is estimated to occur in as many as 10% of individuals with symptomatic GERD . Barrett esophagus is most common in white males and typically presents between 40 and 60 years of age. The greatest concern in Barrett's esophagus is that it confers an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, however, most individuals with Barrett\u2019s esophagus do not develop esophageal tumours .

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Cessation of oxidative phosphorylation and decreased ATPs Smothering causes hypoxic hypoxia so the delivery of oxygen to tissue is reduced . As intracellular oxygen tension falls, oxidative phosphorylation fails and ATP generation decreases, this loss of ATP results initially in reversible cell injury and later in cell death by necrosis . Ischemia, which is the most common cause of cell injury in clinical medicine, results from hypoxia-induced by reduced blood flow, most often due to mechanical arterial obstruction .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissues can promote recovery of cells if they are reversibly injured but can also paradoxically exacerbate cell injury and cause cell death. As a consequence, reperfused tissues may sustain a loss of viable cells in addition to those that are irreversibly damaged by ischemia. This process is called ischemia-reperfusion .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Cellular swelling .
