CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE RATE OF PUTREFACTION: (A) EXTERNAL: TEMPERATURE: Putrefaction begins above 10\u00b0C and is optimum between 21 \u00b0C and 38\u00b0C. A temperature increase of 10\u00b0C usually doubles the rate of most chemical processes and reactions. It is arrested below 0\u00b0C. and above 48\u00b0C. The rate of decomposition is about twice as rapid in summer as in winter. Advanced putrefaction may be seen within 24 to 36 hours in summer. Differences in temperature can cause varying areas in the same body to show different rates of decomposition. Pillows put over and under the deceased's head prevent the circulation of air and cause much more decomposition in the face than is seen in other parts of the body. A frozen body will not undergo decomposition until it defrosts. If decomposition has already set in, refrigeration of the body may not stop decomposition completely. Option: B. MOISTURE: For putrefaction moisture is necessary, and rapid drying of the body practically inhibit If the organic substance is dried, putrefaction is arrested. After death from general anasarca, putrefaction is very rapid, and bodies recovered from the water, if left in the air decompose rapidly. Organs which contain water decompose more readily than dry ones. Option: C. AIR: Free access to air hastens putrefaction, partly because the air conveys organisms to the body. In normal conditions, the unbroken skin acts as an impermeable barrier to bacteria. Moist and still air helps putrefaction. Option: D. CLOTHING: Initially, clothing hastens putrefaction by maintaining body temperature above that at which putrefactive organisms multiply for a longer period. If the clothing is tight as under the belts. In Suspenders, socks, tight-fitting undergarments, and boots, the putrefaction is slow, for it causes compression of the tissues, which drives out the blood from the part, and prevents the entry of internal organisms. Clothes prevent the access of airborne organisms, flies, insects. etc., which destroy the tissues. MANNER OF BURIAL: If the body is buried soon after death, putrefaction is less. Putrefaction is delayed if the body is buried in dry, sandy soil, or a grave deeper than two metres, and when the body is covered and placed in a coffin because of the exclusion of water, air and action of insects and animals. When a body is buried in lime, decomposition is delayed. Putrefaction is rapid in a body buried in a damp, marshy or shallow grave without clothes or a coffin because the body is exposed to constant changes in Putrefaction is more rapid in porous sandy soil than in soils with an excess of clay. Putrefaction is more rapid if changes in decomposition are already present at the time of burial. In acid-peaty soils, even the bones may be destroyed. When the bodies are buried in a common grave without coffins, those bodies lying in the centre of the grave may be better preserved.</p>\n<p></p>",

The metabolic rate is so reduced that the requirement of the individual cell for oxygen is satisfied through the use of oxygen dissolved in the body fluids. In freezing the body, or in severe drug poisoning of the brain the activity of the brain can completely stop and in some cases start again. Suspended animation may be produced voluntarily. Practitioners of yoga can pass into a trance, death-like in character. Involuntary suspension of animation lasting from a few seconds to half an hour or more may be found in vagal inhibition, severe syncopal attacks, newborn infants, drowning, electrocution, sunstroke, cholera, narcotic poisoning, after anaesthesia, shock, hypothermia, cerebral concussion, insanity, etc. The patient can be resuscitated by cardiac massage or electric stimulator and artificial respiration.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A . Forensic taphonomy is the interdisciplinary study and interpretation of postmortem processes of human remains in the dispositional context, i.e., the history of changes in a body following the death Option: B . Lividity: This is the bluish-purple or purplish-red (due to deoxyhaemoglobin) discolouration, which appears under the skin in the most superficial layers of the dermis (rete mucosum) of the dependent parts of the body after death, due to capillo-venous distention. It is also called postmortem staining, subcutaneous hypostasis, livor mortis, cadaveric lividity, suggillations, vibices and darkening of death. Option : D. Algor mortis: The cooling of the body ('chill of death') after death is a complex process, which does not occur at the same rate throughout the body.</p>\n<p></p>",
