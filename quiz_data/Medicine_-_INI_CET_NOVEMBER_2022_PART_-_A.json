The impulses are delayed. This is the mildest type of heart block. Second-degree heart block is classified into two categories: Type I and Type II. In second-degree heart block, the impulses are intermittently blocked. Type I, also called Mobitz Type I or Wenckebach\u2019s AV block: This is a less serious form of second-degree heart block. The electrical signal gets slower and slower until your heart actually skips a beat. Type II, also called Mobitz Type II: While most of the electrical signals reach the ventricles every so often, some do not and your heartbeat becomes irregular and slower than normal. Third-degree heart block: The electrical signal from the atria to the ventricles is completely blocked. Third-degree block seriously affects the heart\u2019s ability to pump blood out to your body.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Treatment:- MEDS ATROPINE EPINEPHRINE NITROGLYCERIN IV Infusion Dopamine TEMPORARY PACER Permanent Pacer WIRES ARE INSERTED INTO THE HEART VIA THE VEINS AND ATTACHED TO A PULSE GENERATOR (THE PACEMAKER).

Sideroblastic anemia is a type of anemia that results from abnormal utilization of iron during erythropoiesis . There are different forms of sideroblastic anemia, and all forms are defined by the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow . Ring sideroblasts are erythroid precursors containing deposits of non-heme iron in mitochondria forming a ring-like distribution around the nucleus. The iron-formed ring covers at least one-third of the nucleus rim. Sideroblastic anemia is known to cause microcytic and macrocytic anemia depending on what type of mutation led to it. Unlike iron deficiency anemia, where there is depletion of iron stores, patients with sideroblastic anemia have normal to high iron level The management of sideroblastic anemia depends on severity. For patients diagnosed with the X-linked sideroblastic anemia, oral pyridoxine 50-100mg/day has been proven to partially or completely correct anemia . For patients who are not responsive to pyridoxine, blood transfusion is indicated if they have severe anemia</p>\n<p></p>",
