She was diagnosed with hypertension by her local doctor due to persistent increased BP records. She also reports that she has chronic constipation and heat intolerance. She feels more heat than others and also has increased sweating. Her abdominal CT scan shows a tumor. Where should this tumor lie according to her symptoms?",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Adrenal medulla The adrenal medulla secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine in response to sympathetic nervous system stimulation. A tumor here called pheochromocytoma can produce uncontrolled secretions of catecholamines and therefore increases the sympathetic innervation of all organ systems , which causes signs and symptoms the patient is suffering from. So, option D is correct.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The most common feature of pheochromocytoma is hypertension and paroxysmal hypertension, which may be very disturbing. Pheochromocytomas are situated in the adrenal medulla or the abdomen near the celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric ganglia (sympathetic ganglia). It occurs at all ages but is common at a young age. It is more common in females. There is labile hypertension and anxiety attacks. There is a headache, excessive sweating, and There may be pain in the chest and abdomen, with nausea and vomiting. There may be sudden flushing. Pheochromocytoma is usually suggested by the history of a symptomatic patient, the discovery of an incidental adrenal mass, or the family history of a patient with a familial disease. Sometimes it is detected incidentally.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- A tumor in other organs in other options will not increase the epinephrine or norepinephrine release and hence, will not lead to signs and symptoms the patient has in question. So, not the correct options.</p>\n<p></p>",

Its embryological origin is from the neuroectodermal layer called the infundibulum. The neurohypophysis is divided into two regions; the pars nervosa and the infundibular stalk.

The main hormones secreted by the adrenal medulla include epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline), which have similar functions. Option C. The anterior pituitary (or adenohypophysis) is a lobe of the gland that is responsible for the synthesis of growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL) or luteotropic hormone (LTH), and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or thyrotropin.</p>\n<p></p>",

These compounds block the ATP-inhabitable K+ channel in the beta cells, which causes depolarization and activation of a Ca2+ channel. The influx of Ca2+ stimulates insulin secretion.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>As insulin levels rise, there is increased glucose utilization by the liver, muscle, and adipose tissues, causing a fall in the plasma glucose concentration. The major hormones regulating energy metabolism are glucagon and insulin. They are produced and secreted by the alpha and beta cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Insulin is an anabolic hormone that targets the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle tissue and promotes glycogen synthesis, fatty acid synthesis and triglyceride formation, and protein synthesis. Glucagon targets the liver and is counterregulatory to insulin, promoting glycogenolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and gluconeogenesis. Glucagon action is mediated by G protein\u2013coupled plasma membrane receptor activation of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A activation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. Glucagon or glucose would stimulate insulin secretion; however, there would be a transient increase in the plasma glucose concentration. Option B & D.
