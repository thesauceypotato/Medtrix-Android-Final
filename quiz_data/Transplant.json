The donor vessels of the pancreas graft are anastomosed to the recipient iliac vessels and the exocrine secretions are most commonly dealt with by anastomosing the graft duodenum to the small bowel (enteric drainage) often via a Roux-en-Y loop, although the duodenum may sometimes be anastomosed to the bladder (urinary drainage) The bladder-drained pancreas can cause cystitis from pancreatic enzyme secretion and electrolyte disturbance, acidosis and dehydration from the loss of bicarbonate. Up to 50% of patients with bladder-drained pancreas transplants require enteric conversion (where the transplant duodenum is surgically detached from the bladder and reconnected to the small bowel) within the first year following the transplant. This usually follows recurrent hospital admissions for acidosis and is performed to mitigate the risk of acute kidney injury. Also, the indication for conversion may be driven by patient choice because of symptoms from chemical cystitis, urinary tract infection (UTI) and the need for high-dose oral sodium bicarbonate. Late complications of pancreas transplantation include pseudoaneurysm formation, which may result from fungal infection or a vascular anastomosis, and highlights the importance of culturing the preservation fluid at the time of transplant and treating any cultured microorganisms</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Options: A & B.

Advantages : Several hereditary metabolic diseases such as familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), maple syrup urine disease and familial hypercholesterolaemia are caused by aberrant or deficient protein production in the liver, and these conditions can be cured with an orthotopic LT. Although their native livers eventually caused severe systemic disease in these patients, these livers are otherwise structurally and functionally normal, and hence used as domino for those with end-stage liver failure. Even if they develop amyloidosis, it would take 10\u201320 years for the disease to become symptomatic in these recipients. If they have no recurrence of the tumour and become symptomatic from FAP in the future they can be offered a retransplant without the risk of recurrence of malignancy. Example: Domino LT is the use of a liver from a patient with FAP to a patient who is outside transplant criteria for liver malignancy.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Types of LT (based on source of liver allograft) DDLT, which includes DBD (70\u201380%) and DCD (20\u201330%) LDLT \u2013 this can be adult to adult or adult to child Split and reduced-size LT ECDs Auxiliary LT Domino LT Paired-exchange programme</p>\n<p></p>",

Allograft dysfunction should be investigated by urinalysis and culture to exclude urinary tract infection, CNI blood levels for drug-mediated nephrotoxicity and Doppler ultrasound scanning to check for arterial perfusion, venous drainage and hydronephrosis due to urinary obstruction. If there is uncertainty about the cause of graft dysfunction, a percutaneous needle-core transplant biopsy should be performed to establish whether allograft rejection is present. Long-term Allograft Dysfunction : Immunological : The commonest cause of long-term renal allograft damage and subsequent loss is chronic AMR. This is often related to inadequate compliance with immunosuppressive medication. There is no proven treatment for chronic AMR. Non - Immunological: Irreversible and leads to transplant failure Factors in maintaining good long-term allograft function Meticulous adherence to immunosuppressive medication Good blood pressure control (<130/80 mmHg).</p>\n<p></p>",
