An immediate application of Pasteur's work was the introduction of antiseptic techniques in surgery by Joseph Lister, effecting a pronounced drop in mortality and morbidity due to surgical sepsis. Lister's antiseptic surgery involving carbolic acid was a milestone in the evolution of surgical practice from the era of 'laudable pus' to modern aseptic techniques.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

An accidental observation that chicken-cholera bacillus cultures left on the bench for several weeks lost their pathogenic property but retained their ability to protect the birds against subsequent infection by them led to the discovery of the process of attenuation and the development of live vaccines attenuated cultures of the anthrax bacillus by incubation at high temperature- (42-43\u00b0C) and proved that injection of such cultures in animals induced specific protection against anthrax. It was Pasteur who coined the term vaccine for such prophylactic preparations.</p>\n<p></p>",

Different investigators in such profusion reported the causative agents of various infectious diseases. Hence, it became necessary to introduce criteria for proving the claims that a microorganism isolated from an illness was indeed causally related to it. These criteria were enunciated by Koch and are known as Koch's postulates. According to these, a microorganism can be accepted as the causative agent of an infectious disease only if the following conditions are satisfied: - The bacterium should be constantly associated with the lesions of the disease. (STATEMENT 1) Isolating the bacteria in pure culture from the lesions should be possible. (STATEMENT 2) Inoculation of such pure culture into suitable laboratory animals should reproduce lesions of the disease.
