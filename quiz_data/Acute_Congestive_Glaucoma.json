      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Acute congestive / angle closure glaucoma Classically , patients are elderly , suffer from hyperopia , and have no history of glaucoma . Most commonly, they present with periorbital pain and visual deficits . The pain is boring in nature and associated with an ipsilateral headache . Patients note blurry vision and describe the phenomenon of \" seeing halos around objects .\" Careful investigation may elucidate a precipitating factor , such as dim light or medications (e.g., anticholinergics, sympathomimetics). In a large percentage of patients, extraocular symptoms and systemic manifestations are the chief complaints.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Patients present with headaches and may receive medications for migraines or an evaluation for a subarachnoid haemorrhage .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A . Acute retrobulbar neuritis: Retrobulbar neuritis is a form of optic neuritis in which the optic nerve, which is at the back of the eye, becomes inflamed . The inflamed area is between the back of the eye and the brain. The optic nerve contains fibres that carry visual information from the nerve cells in the retina to the nerve cells in the brain. Option C . Acute anterior uveitis: Acute anterior uveitis is characterised by an extremely painful red eye , often associated with photophobia , and occasionally with decreased visual acuity . Chronic anterior uveitis is defined as inflammation lasting over 6 weeks . It is usually asymptomatic , but many people have mild symptoms during exacerbations. Option D . Severe Keratoconjunctivitis: Keratoconjunctivitis refers to an inflammatory process that involves both the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis) and the superficial cornea (keratitis) which can occur in association with viral, bacterial, autoimmune, toxic, and allergic aetiologies.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Several case reports discuss patients presenting with vomiting and abdominal pain who were misdiagnosed with gastroenteritis.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Laser iridotomy The treatment of choice for pupillary-block ACG is laser iridotomy. Iridectomy with an argon and/or Nd : YAG laser creates an opening in the iris through which aqueous humour trapped in the posterior chamber can reach the anterior chamber and trabecular meshwork. As aqueous humour flows into the anterior chamber through the iris defect, pressure behind the iris falls, allowing the iris to fall back towards its normal position.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>This procedure opens the anterior chamber angle and relieves the blockade of the trabecular meshwork . It also prevents future pupillary blocks and AAC.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A . Pilocarpine: Pilocarpine is a medication used to reduce pressure inside the eye and treat dry mouth . As eye drops, they are used to manage angle closure glaucoma until surgery can be performed, ocular hypertension , primary open angle glaucoma, and to bring about constriction of the pupil following its dilation. Option: C . Timolol: Ophthalmic timolol is used to treat glaucoma , a condition in which increased pressure in the eye can lead to gradual loss of vision . Timolol is in a class of medications called beta - blockers . It works by decreasing the pressure in the eye. Option: D . Trabeculoplasty: Laser trabeculoplasty is a treatment for open - angle glaucoma . It uses laser light that is applied to the trabecular meshwork. The trabecular meshwork is an area made up of tiny channels where fluid drains from the eye.</p>\n<p></p>",

Patients complain of a severe unilateral headache and diminution of vision in the \u2018red\u2019eye. Nausea may be frequently associated. On examination, ciliary and conjunctival congestion, corneal oedema, a shallow anterior chamber and iris bomb\u00e9 with a vertically oval, mid-dilated pupil are present. After resolution of the corneal oedema, a gonioscopic ally closed angle can be seen, i.e. extensive iridocorneal synechiae, and the optic disc may be found to be either hyperaemic or normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B . A diagnosis of chronic primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is made if the intraocular pressure is chronically raised in eyes having synechial closure over at least 180\u00b0 in an occludable angle. Changes in the optic nerve head and visual field should also be present. Repeated subacute attacks or acute attacks persisting for more than a few hours can cause chronic PACG. Since there is no past history of similar attacks and the present history is of short duration, it is a case of acute PACG. Option: C . Primary open angle glaucoma is generally asymptomatic, and patients may have nonspecific complaints such as headache, frequent changes in presbyopic correction, \u2018blind spot\u2019 or scotoma, especially in the inferior field, and difficulty in dark adaptation. They do not present acutely as in this case, and anterior chamber depth is normal in these cases. Option: D. Conjunctivitis presents with symptoms and signs of discomfort, foreign body sensation, photophobia, and discharge from the eyes (type of discharge depending on the cause), conjunctival congestion and chemosis i.e. swelling of conjunctiva. Pupillary changes and shallow anterior chambers are not found in conjunctivitis.</p>\n<p></p>",
