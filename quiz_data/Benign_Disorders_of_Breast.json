Therefore, the lymph node enlargement can be due to reactive hyperplasia rather than the spread of cancer cells to the lymph nodes. Histopathology consists of the following: A dense lymphoreticular infiltration composed predominantly of lymphocytes and plasma cells. A sheet-like growth pattern of anaplastic cells with absent ductal or lobular differentiation.

Fibroadenomas should be closely monitored with clinical breast exams and imaging tests (ultrasounds and mammograms). Ultrasound-guided biopsy is indicated when lesions enlarge or have atypical imaging findings to rule out malignancy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Fibroadenoma is the most common benign tumour of the female breast, composed of both fibrous and glandular tissue . It is most commonly seen in young women between the ages of 15 to 30 years and is caused by increased sensitivity of focal areas of breast tissue to estrogen. Fibroadenoma is commonly known as \" breast mouse. \" Pathology : The tumour is an encapsulated spherical lesion that arises from the interlobular stroma, with stromal cells being either monoclonal or polyclonal. There are two types of fibroadenomas: pericanalicular (hard) and intracanalicular (soft) . The pericanalicular type is due to the proliferation of connective tissue inside the elastic lamina. In contrast, the intracanalicular type is due to the proliferation of connective tissue outside the elastic lamina. Clinical Features: Painless, slowly growing, solitary, mobile lump in the breast. Diagnosis : Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is the initial diagnostic test of choice. The presence of an antler horn configuration of ductal epidermal cells is highly suggestive of fibroadenoma . Popcorn calcification is seen on mammography . Treatment : No treatment is necessary when the diagnosis is confirmed. However, excision biopsy is the treatment for suspicious lesions and cosmetic indications.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Phyllodes tumour is generally large (average diameter of 4\u20137 cm), rapidly growing, and typically affects patients between 40\u201350 years of age . Also, patients with phyllodes tumours may notice an increase in the size of a breast mass a few weeks after discovering it. This 29-year-old woman lacks the symptoms of a phyllodes tumour, making it an unlikely diagnosis. Option: C. Although this patient reports a history of trauma to the breast, fat necrosis typically presents as an ill-defined, firm breast mass with an overlying area of skin thickening or retraction , which is inconsistent with this woman's well-defined, well-defined, rubbery breast lump. Option: D. Fibrocystic change of the breast is the most common benign lesion of the breast and typically presents with premenstrual breast pain that may be recurring or constant and unilateral or bilateral. On examination, areas of suspected growth tend to be diffuse as opposed to the focal, circumscribed mass found in this patient, making it an unlikely diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Mammography findings Popcorn calcification - fibroadenoma. Lead-pipe/egg-shell calcification - traumatic fat necrosis. Broken-needle type of calcification - duct ectasia. Tea-cup calcification - fibrocystic disease.</p>\n<p></p>",

Kaposi sarcoma may also present with purple-coloured skin plaques of the extremities that can progress to deeper, more nodular, and, occasionally, ulcerative lesions. However, the lesions occur in patients with significantly immunocompromised status (e.g., AIDS, transplant recipients).

Some of the recognised risk factors for the development of breast cancer include nulliparity or first pregnancy after the age of 30 years, late menopause, early menarche, a history of breast cancer, the presence of a first-degree relative with breast cancer, and prolonged exposure to \u2018unopposed\u2019 oestrogen (e.g., oral contraceptive pills and hormone replacement therapy). Option: C. Invasive ductal carcinoma accounts for about 80% of all breast cancers. Option: D. In simple mastectomy, the breast tissue and nipple\u2013areolar complex are excised.</p>\n<p></p>",

The patient recently underwent a right mastectomy for a node-negative, oestrogen- and progesterone-receptor-positive tumour. She was started on an aromatase inhibitor for adjuvant therapy; however, the medication was discontinued due to severe fatigue and poor sleep. As a result, she is scheduled to begin a 5-year course of adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen. The patient has no other chronic medical conditions, and her only medication is a daily multivitamin. Her last menstrual period was 5 years ago. This patient's father had a myocardial infarction at age 65; family history is otherwise non-contributory. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Vital signs are stable. BMI is 21 kg/m\u00b2. The patient has many concerns about tamoxifen therapy and asks about potential side effects.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hyperplasia of endometrium Adjuvant endocrine therapy is commonly used for the treatment of nonmetastatic, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. The most commonly used endocrine agents include tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors , and ovarian suppression (e.g., GnRH agonists or surgery). Tamoxifen is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator that is an oestrogen receptor antagonist in the breast . It is the preferred adjuvant treatment for premenopausal women at low risk of breast cancer recurrence. Tamoxifen is also a second-line endocrine adjuvant agent for postmenopausal women who cannot use aromatase inhibitor therapy (e.g., intolerable side effects) Tamoxifen acts as an oestrogen agonist in the uterus that can stimulate excessive endometrial proliferation. Therefore, tamoxifen use is associated with endometrial polyps in premenopausal women as well as endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in postmenopausal women. These risks continue for the duration of therapy and resolve after discontinuation of treatment. However, the benefit of improved survival from breast cancer due to tamoxifen outweighs the risk of endometrial cancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. In postmenopausal women , tamoxifen has some oestrogen-like activity on the bone , which can increase bone mineral density and significantly reduce the incidence of osteoporosis. However, tamoxifen is generally not a first-line agent for osteoporosis treatment due to the risk of endometrial cancer. Option: B. Dysplasia of the cervical transformation zone is typically caused by chronic human papillomavirus infection. Tamoxifen has no known effects on the cervix. Option: D. Intimal thickening of the coronary arteries is a precursor lesion for atherosclerosis. Tamoxifen decreases the blood cholesterol level and may protect against coronary artery disease .</p>\n<p></p>",

This rare but aggressive cancer classically presents as rapid-onset oedematous cutaneous thickening with a \"peau d'orange\" appearance (e.g., superficial dimpling, fine pitting). The affected breast is oedematous, erythematous, and painful. Itching, a palpable breast mass, and nipple changes (e.g., flattening/retraction) may also be present.
