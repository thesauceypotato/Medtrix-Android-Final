      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>a and e Statement: a. False-The number of Na+ ions entering the cell per action potential is very small relative to the number present around 0.02%, so intracellular Na+ concentration is not materially altered by a single action potential. Statement: b. True- Although rapid depolarization activates voltage-gated Na+ channels, slow Depolarization (e.g., by chronic hyperkalemia) allows time for the inactivation gates to close. Statement: c. True- Beta-adrenergic stimulation increases the inward Ca current, leading to a dome-shaped plateau and increased contractility. Statement: d. True- The absolute refractory period extends from the onset of depolarization to mid-repolarization, by which time relaxation is just beginning. Statement: e.

It is the \"pacemaker\" because its fastest ability to auto-depolarize and repolarize makes it the first to initiate each normal heartbeat.

The SA node is supraventricular and is sensitive to parasympathetic and sympathetic influence.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A. FALSE- The atrial muscle conducts excitation from the pacemaker to the AV node. Purkinje fibers are found in the ventricles. Option: B. FALSE- Both nodes have a parasympathetic vagal innervation and a sympathetic innervation. Option: C. FALSE- Cells in the AV node, bundles, and Purkinje system can all pace make, but they do so at a lower rate than the SA node. The SA node is the normal cardiac pacemaker, impulses generated in the SA node pass through the atria from the pathways to the AV node, through this node to the bundle of His, and then its branches via the Purkinje system to the ventricular muscle.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Anatomic considerations: The SA node is located at the junction of the Superior Vena Cava with the right atrium. The AV node is located in the right posterior portion of the Interatrial septum. There are three bundles of atrial fibers that contain Purkinje-type fibers and connect the SA node to the AV node: the anterior, middle (tract of Wenckebach), and posterior (tract of Thorel) tracts. The AV node is continuous with the bundle of His, which gives off a left bundle branch at the top of the interventricular septum and continues as the Right bundle branch. The left bundle branch divides into an anterior fascicle and a posterior fascicle. The branches and fascicles run subendocardial down either side of the septum and come into contact with the Purkinje system, whose fibers spread to all parts of the ventricular myocardium. SA node is the normal cardiac pacemaker as it discharges at the highest rate.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Generates impulse at the highest rate The discharge rate of the sinus node is considerably faster than the natural self-excitatory discharge rate of either the A-V node or the Purkinje fibers. Each time the sinus node discharges, its impulse is conducted into both the A-V node and the Purkinje fibers, also discharging their excitable membranes. However, the sinus node discharges again before either the A-V node or the Purkinje fibers can reach their own thresholds for self-excitation. Therefore, the new impulse from the sinus node discharges both the A-V node and the Purkinje fibers before self-excitation can occur in either of these sites. Thus, the sinus node controls the beat of the heart because its rate of rhythmical discharge is faster than that of any other part of the heart. Therefore, the sinus node is almost always the pacemaker of the normal heart. In the normal human heart, each beat originates in the SA node (normal sinus rhythm, NSR). The heart beats about 70 times a minute at rest. The rate is slowed (bradycardia) during sleep and accelerated (tachycardia) by emotion, exercise, fever, and many other stimuli.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>In healthy young individuals breathing at a normal rate, the heart rate varies with the phases of respiration: It accelerates during inspiration and decelerates during expiration, especially if the depth of breathing is increased. This sinus arrhythmia is a normal phenomenon and is primarily due to fluctuations in parasympathetic output to the heart. During inspiration, impulses in the vagi from the stretch receptors in the lungs inhibit the cardio-inhibitory area in the medulla oblongata. The tonic vagal discharge keeps the heart rate slowly decreasing, and the heart rate rises. Disease processes affecting the sinus node lead to marked bradycardia accompanied by dizziness and syncope.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Sick sinus syndrome (bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome; sinus node dysfunction): is a collection of heart rhythm disorders that include sinus bradycardia (slow heart rates from the natural pacemaker of the heart), tachycardias (fast heart rates), and bradycardia-tachycardia (alternating slow and fast heart rhythms). Sick sinus syndrome is relatively uncommon and is usually found in people older than 50, in whom the cause is often a nonspecific, scar-like degeneration of the heart\u2019s conduction system. When found in younger people, especially in children, a common cause of sick sinus syndrome is heart surgery, especially in the upper chambers. Holter monitoring is an effective tool for diagnosing sick sinus syndrome because of the episodic nature of the disorder. Extremely slow heart rate and prolonged pauses may be seen during Holter monitoring, along with episodes of atrial tachycardias. Abnormal pacemaker: A pacemaker elsewhere than the sinus node is called an \u201cectopic\u201d pacemaker. An ectopic pacemaker causes an abnormal sequence of contraction of the different parts of the heart and can cause significant debility of heart pumping. The new pacemaker then occurs most frequently at the A-V node or in the penetrating portion of the A-V bundle on the way to the ventricles.</p>\n<p></p>",

The individual fibers are separated by membranes, but membrane depolarization spreads radially through them as if they were a syncytium because of the presence of gap junctions.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>PHASES OF VENTRICULAR ACTION POTENTIAL Phase 0: rapid sodium influx: rapid depolarization phase Phase 1: potassium efflux and occurs: partial or early repolarization phase Phase 2: potassium efflux and calcium influx takes place: plateau phase Phase 3: potassium efflux takes place: final repolarization phase Phase 4: the resting state is attained</p>\n<p></p>",

Parasympathetic stimulation along the vagus nerve decreases the heart rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>EFFECT OF SYMPATHETIC AND CHOLINERGIC SYSTEM ON THE AP OF THE SA NODE When the cholinergic vagal fibers to nodal tissue are stimulated, the membrane becomes hyperpolarized and the slope of the prepotential is decreased because the Ach released at the nerve endings increases the K+ conductance of nodal tissue. This action is mediated by M2 muscarinic receptors, which, via the By subunit of a G protein, open a special set of K+ channels. In addition, activation of the M2 receptors decreases cyclic adenosine 3',5'- monophosphate (CAMP) in the cells, and this slows the opening of Ca The result is a decrease in the firing rate. Strong vagal stimulation may abolish spontaneous discharge for some time.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. Acetylcholine (ACh) released on vagal stimulation reduces the heart rate by increasing the K+ conductance of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (S-A) node. Option C. Parasympathetic (vagal) activation, which releases acetylcholine onto the SA node that binds to muscarinic receptors, decreases pacemaker rate (phase 4 slope) by increasing potassium conductance and decreasing the pacemaker currents (If) and slowing inward calcium currents. Option D. The right vagus nerve primarily innervates the SA node , whereas the left vagus innervates the AV node.</p>\n<p></p>",

A delay of about O.1 s (AV nodal delay) occurs before excitation spreads to the ventricles.

It moves along the ventricular walls to the AV groove, proceeding from the endocardial to the epicardial surface.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Rest orders are inappropriate; the correct order of depolarization after the stimulation of the Purkinje fibers is Septum\u2192 Endocardium\u2192 Epicardium.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The Purkinje fibers allow for a coordinated and controlled rhythm of blood circulation. Purkinje fibers comprise a distinct type of cardiac muscles that secure them the numerous efficient and quickest conductors of impulses in the cardiac system. The histology of Purkinje fibers reveals that they have thinner muscle tissues with fewer muscle strands than standard cardiac cells, which makes them appear lighter than different cells in a stained slide.</p>\n<p></p>",
