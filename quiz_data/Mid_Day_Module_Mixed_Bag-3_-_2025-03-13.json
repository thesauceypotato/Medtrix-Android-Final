B) Uterine contractility is mediated by innervations from level T7 - T8</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The incorrect statement regarding the innervation of the uterus is option B. Uterine contractility is primarily mediated by hormonal mechanisms rather than by specific spinal innervations. Hormones such as estrogen, prostaglandins, and oxytocin play a significant role in inducing uterine contractions, while progesterone helps maintain uterine relaxation.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Sensory level is from T10 to L1: The sensory innervation of the uterus is indeed from spinal levels T10 to L1. These afferent fibers enter the spinal cord via the inferior hypogastric plexus and are responsible for transmitting sensory information from the uterus.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Sensory level is from T10 to L1:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. In the 1st stage of labor, pain is due to the fibers at level of T10 - L1: During the 1st stage of labor, pain is mediated by spinal segments T10 to L1. This pain is due to the distension of the cervix and lower uterine segment, as well as the contraction of the uterus.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. In the 1st stage of labor, pain is due to the fibers at level of T10 - L1:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. In early labor, pain is usually because of the uterine contraction: In early labor, pain is usually related to uterine contractions, which stimulate nociceptors in the genital tract and can cause discomfort and pain.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. In early labor, pain is usually because of the uterine contraction:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Uterine contractility is not mediated by innervations from spinal level T7 - T8; instead, it is primarily influenced by hormonal mechanisms.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Page 500, DC Dutta\u2019s Textbook of Obstetrics, 8 th edition</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Page 500, DC Dutta\u2019s Textbook of Obstetrics, 8 th edition</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
