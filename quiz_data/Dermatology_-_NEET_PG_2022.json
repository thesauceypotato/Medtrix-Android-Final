Nail findings in psoriasis - Psoriasis may affect any part of the nail unit, including the nail matrix, nail bed, and hyponychium. Nail matrix disease presents with pits, ridges and grooves of the nail plate. Nail pitting Deep, coarse, irregular depressions in the nail plate. Oil spots or salmon patches (Pathognomic) Translucid and discolored red\u2013yellow patches located on the nail plate Onycholysis Separation of the nail plate from nail bed Subungual hyperkeratosis Raising the nail plate off the nail bed as a result of deposition of keratinocytes Longitudinal ridging Linear lines over the nail plates Splinter hemorrhages Small, linear structures, 2\u20133 mm long, at the distal end of nail plate</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Psoriasis It is a chronic, T-cell mediated , inflammatory skin disease presenting with different phenotypes due to the interplay of genetics, environmental, and immunological factors.

On the skin, lichen planus usually appears as purplish, itchy, flat bumps that develop over several weeks. Option D.
