      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Putrefaction The last stage of decomposition is the destruction of tissues/bodies. The disintegration of body tissues after death is known as decomposition. The terms decomposition and putrefaction are used as synonyms. Putrefaction usually follows the disappearance of rigor mortis. During the hot season, it may commence before rigor mortis has wholly disappeared from the lower extremities. Organisms/bacteria gain entry into tissues mainly from the alimentary tract and also through the respiratory tract, and they multiply in tissues. As they multiply, the bacteria spread via vessels using proteins and carbohydrates of blood as culture media. They release bacterial enzymes.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option A. Livor mortis - This is the bluish-purple or purplish-red (due to deoxyhaemoglobin) discolouration which appears under the skin in the most superficial layers of the dermis (rete mucosum) of the dependent parts of the body after death, due to capillo-venous distention. O ption B. Primary Flaccidity - During this stage, death is only somatic (no cellular death) and lasts one to two hours. All the muscles of the body begin to relax soon after death. The lower jaw falls, eyelids lose tension, and joints are flexible. The body flattens over areas in contact with the surface on which it rests (contact flattening). Option D. Algor mortis -It\u2019s the process of cooling down a dead Heat is generated by the residual metabolic process (glycogenolysis) of dying tissues and by the metabolic activity of intestinal bacteria, due to which body temperature does not fall for some time. With the start of cooling, a temperature gradient develops from the surface to the core of any body part. The heat exchange between the core and the body's surface occurs only by conduction. At fi1\u00b7st, heat is lost from superficial layers of the body only. Due to the low velocity of heat transport inside the body, it takes some time for heat to be conducted from the deeper to the more superficial layers. Finally, the temperature gradient reaches the core. Internal organs cool primarily by conduction. Conductive heat exchange occurs due to the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings. The body heat is lost mainly by conduction and convection. In non-contact areas, heat exchange occurs by a conventional mechanism, which exceeds the contact surface.</p>\n<p></p>",

Putrefaction usually follows the disappearance of rigor mortis. During the hot season, it may commence before rigor mortis has completely disappeared from the lower extremities. Option C. Secondary Relaxation- Flaccidity following rigor mortis is caused by the action of the alkaline liquids produced by putrefaction. Another view is that rigidity disappears due to the solution of myosin by an excess of acid produced during rigor mortis. A third view is that enzymes are developed in the dead muscle, which dissolves myosin by the process of autodigestion. Option D. Postmortem luminescence- Postmortem luminescence is usually due to contamination by bacteria, e.g., Photobacterium fischeri, and the light comes from them and not from putrefying material. Luminescent fungi, Armillaria mellea, is another source of light.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Blisters Development of Foul-smelling Gases: The chemical processes in this stage are those of reduction, the complex proteins and carbohydrates being split into simpler compounds of arninoacids, ammonia, CO, C02, hydrogen sulphide, phosphorated hydrogen, methane and mercaptans. The gas formation in the blood vessels may force bloodstained fluid, air or liquid fat between the epidermis and dermis, forming small blisters in 18 to 24 hours. Blisters are formed first on the lower surfaces of the trunk and thighs, where tissues contain more fluid due to hypostatic oedema.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Skeletonisation- The time required for skeletonisation varies considerably and mainly depends on the ambient temperature, insect colonisation of the body and scavenger activity. A corpse can be skeletonised in a hot, humid environment with heavy insect activity within a few days. In the case of an exposed body, flies, maggots, ants, cockroaches, rats, dogs, jackals, vultures, etc., may reduce the body to a skeleton within a few days. When the body is in the water, it may be attacked by fish, crabs, etc., which reduces the body to a skeleton in a few days. In an uncoffined body buried in a shallow grave, putrefaction is delayed to a moderate extent. In a deeply buried body, the lower temperature, the exclusion of air, the absence of animal life, etc., markedly delay decomposition. Option: B. Adipocere- Adipocere (cire=wax) is a modification of putrefaction. In this, the fatty tissues of the body change into a substance known as adipocere. It is seen most commonly in bodies immersed in water or a damp, warm environment. Option: D. The marbling of Skin- The superficial veins, especially over the roots of the limb, thighs, sides of the abdomen, shoulders, chest and neck, are stained greenish-brown or purplish-red depending on the total amount of sulphhaemoglobin formation within the affected vessels (linear branching pattern) due to the haemolysis of red cells, which stains the wall of the vessel and infiltrates into the tissue, giving a marbled appearance (red, then the greenish pattern in skin resembling the branches of a tree)</p>\n<p></p>",
