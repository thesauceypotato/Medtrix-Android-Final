The superior head attaches to the articular disc and the capsule of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). This muscle plays a crucial role in the opening of the mouth, protrusion of the mandible, and moving the jaw from side to side. Dysfunction or spasms of this muscle could contribute to jaw locking during yawning. The lateral pterygoid is, therefore, closely associated with the movements and function of the TMJ.</li><li>\u2022 All Innervated by CN V 3</li><li>\u2022 All Innervated by CN V 3</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

It does not attach to the articular disc of the TMJ, but it plays a role in jaw movement.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Temporalis:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Medial pterygoid: The medial pterygoid muscle is similar in function to the masseter muscle and helps in elevating the mandible, thus assisting in closing the mouth. It also plays a role in moving the jaw from side to side. However, like the temporalis, it doesn't directly attach to the articular disc of the TMJ.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Medial pterygoid:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Masseter: The masseter muscle is one of the primary muscles of mastication (chewing). It originates from the zygomatic arch and inserts onto the lateral aspect of the mandibular angle and ramus. Its primary function is to elevate the mandible, assisting in closing the mouth. It does not have an attachment to the articular disc of the TMJ but is important for jaw function.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

The nerves involved are the oculomotor nerve (III), the facial nerve (VII), the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), and the vagus nerve (X) from the cranial component. From the sacral part, the second to fourth sacral nerves (S2, S3, S4) are included. These nerves contribute to the parasympathetic functions of the body, which include reducing the heart rate, increasing glandular secretion, and relaxing sphincters among other roles.

It is named after Jacques Lisfranc, a French surgeon who described amputations through this region during the Napoleonic Wars. The Lisfranc joint complex also includes the articulation between the other cuneiform bones and the metatarsals, as well as the tarsometatarsal ligaments and interosseous ligaments. The Lisfranc ligament is important for maintaining stability of the midfoot and for transferring forces from the hindfoot to the forefoot during walking and running. Injuries to the Lisfranc joint can result in significant disability and may require surgery to repair or stabilize the joint.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Chopart Ligament: Chopart's ligament is not a well-known ligament in the foot. The term \"Chopart joint\" typically refers to the midtarsal joint, which includes the articulation between the talus and navicular (talocalcaneonavicular joint) and the calcaneus and cuboid (calcaneocuboid joint). Ligaments associated with these joints help maintain their stability.</li><li>\u2022 Option A.</li><li>\u2022 Chopart Ligament:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Spring Ligament: The spring ligament, also known as the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament, connects the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus to the navicular bone. It is a vital structure for supporting the arch of the foot and preventing its collapse.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.</li><li>\u2022 Spring Ligament:</li><li>\u2022 Option D . Deltoid Ligament: The deltoid ligament is located on the medial side of the ankle joint. It is a complex ligament that attaches to the medial malleolus of the tibia and connects to various tarsal bones, such as the talus, calcaneus, and navicular. The deltoid ligament plays a significant role in stabilizing the ankle joint and preventing excessive eversion (outward rolling) of the foot.</li><li>\u2022 Option D</li><li>\u2022 Deltoid Ligament:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The Lisfranc ligament is specifically associated with the connection between the medial cuneiform and the base of the 2nd metatarsal. It is a strong ligament that helps stabilize the midfoot and prevents dislocation of the tarsometatarsal (TMT) joints. Injury to this ligament is commonly referred to as a Lisfranc injury, which can result from traumatic events like falls or sports injuries.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

The optic nerve is primarily responsible for carrying visual information from the retina to the brain, making it crucial for vision. However, it does not directly control eye movements, unlike other cranial nerves involved in eye muscle innervation. Its role is purely sensory, allowing the brain to receive and process visual input, which is essential for sight but does not influence the position or movement of the eyeball.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 B.

It is characterized by a combination of infection, low blood pressure (hypotension), and organ dysfunction. Here are some key points about septic shock:</li><li>\u27a4 Infection : Septic shock typically begins with an infection, often caused by bacteria, but it can also result from fungal or viral infections. Common sources of infection include lung infections (pneumonia), urinary tract infections, abdominal infections, and skin infections. Systemic Inflammatory Response : In response to the infection, the body's immune system initiates a widespread inflammatory response. This response can become dysregulated, leading to an exaggerated release of inflammatory molecules (cytokines) into the bloodstream. Hypotension : One of the hallmark features of septic shock is low blood pressure (hypotension). The inflammation and vasodilation caused by the infection can lead to a drop in blood pressure, which can result in inadequate blood flow to vital organs. Organ Dysfunction : As blood pressure drops and organs receive less oxygen and nutrients, multiple organ systems can begin to fail. This can lead to dysfunction in the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, and other organs. Organ dysfunction is a critical component of septic shock and contributes to its high mortality rate. Symptoms : Symptoms of septic shock can include fever or hypothermia (low body temperature), rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, confusion, altered mental status, and signs of organ dysfunction such as respiratory distress, kidney failure, or liver dysfunction. Treatment : The treatment of septic shock is a medical emergency and involves aggressive interventions. It typically includes antibiotics to treat the underlying infection, intravenous fluids to maintain blood pressure, vasopressor medications to constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure, and supportive care in an intensive care unit (ICU).</li><li>\u27a4 Infection : Septic shock typically begins with an infection, often caused by bacteria, but it can also result from fungal or viral infections.
