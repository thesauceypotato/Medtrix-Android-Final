      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Cytokeratin A mediastinal mass has a differential of thymoma and T-cell ALL . T-cell ALL will have the markers TDT (lymphoblast), CD1a and CD3 . Thymoma has 2 components- epithelial and lymphoid components\u2014so is positive for EMA, cytokeratin 7 and 20, CD57 CD5, bcl-2, calretinin, vimentin, CD3, CD1a, CD20, CD99 . To differentiate between a mediastinal mass being a thymoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the following immunohistochemical markers can be helpful: Cytokeratin : Thymomas typically express cytokeratin , which is a marker for epithelial cells. Positive staining for cytokeratin suggests an epithelial origin, supporting a diagnosis of thymoma. CD1a : CD1a is a marker for immature T-cells . It is typically positive in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T-ALL ) but negative in thymomas. CD3 : CD3 is a marker for mature T-cells . It is usually positive in T-ALL , including both T-cell and mature T-cell subtypes. In contrast, thymomas are typically negative for CD3. TdT (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) : TdT is an enzyme expressed in immature lymphoid cells , and its expression is characteristic of ALL . Thymomas are usually negative for TdT. By evaluating the expression of these markers, a pathologist can assess the cell lineage and differentiation status of the cells within the mediastinal mass, helping to differentiate between thymoma and ALL. However, it's important to note that these markers should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings, imaging studies, and other diagnostic tests for a comprehensive diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>CD markers: Cells CD markers Immature CD34 Blast CD 34 Lymphoblast: TdT WBC CD 45 Myeloblast MPO, CD 13, 33, 117 Lymphoid \u25cf       B cells: CD19 , 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, CD 10, CD 79a, PAX 5 \u25cf       T cells: CD 3 , 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \u25cf       NK cells: CD 16, 56 Monocytes CD 14, 64</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B: Incorrect , positive in T-ALL .

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>X-linked recessive In the given pedigree, males are prominently affected so it goes in the favor of X-linked disease . Now since there is generation skip , it indicates recessive . Therefore, it is an X-linked recessive .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>X linked recessive The given disease manifests only in males; therefore, it is sex-linked disease females are not affected, so they must be carriers . This is a classical feature of X-linked recessive disorders . All sex-linked disorders are X-linked, and almost all are recessive. Several genes are located in the male-specific region of Y, all related to spermatogenesis. Males with mutations affecting the Y-linked genes are usually infertile; hence, there is no Y-linked inheritance . X-linked recessive inheritance accounts for a small number of well-defined clinical conditions. For the most part, the Y chromosome is not homologous to the X chromosome, so mutant genes on the X chromosome do not have corresponding alleles on the Y chromosome. Thus, males are said to be Hemizygous for X-linked mutant genes, so these disorders are expressed in males. Other features characterising these disorders are as follows: An affected male does not transmit the disorder to his sons, but all daughters are carriers. Of course, sons of heterozygous women have one chance in two of receiving the mutant gene. A heterozygous female usually does not express the complete phenotypic change because of the paired normal allele. Because of the random inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in the female, females have a variable proportion of cells in which the mutant X chromosome is active. Thus, the normal allele can be inactivated in most cells, permitting full expression of heterozygous X-linked conditions in females . X Linked Recessive: System Disease Musculoskeletal Duchenne muscular dystrophy Blood Hemophilia A and B Chronic granulomatous disease Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency Immune Agammaglobulinemia Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome Metabolic Diabetes insipidus Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Nervous Fragile X syndrome 2</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: Y-linked recessive. Incorrect . Option B: Y-linked dominant. Incorrect . Option D: X-linked dominant. Incorrect, Transmitted through both parents. Children of affected mothers each have a 50% chance of being affected. 100% of daughters and 0% of sons of affected fathers will be affected.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Y linkage , also known as holandric inheritance , describes traits that are produced by genes located on the Y chromosome . It is a form of sex linkage. Y linkage can be difficult to detect. This is partly because the Y chromosome is small and contains fewer genes than the autosomal chromosomes or the X chromosome. For a trait to be considered Y linkage, it must exhibit these characteristics: Occurs only in males Appears in all sons of males who exhibit that trait Is absent from daughters of trait carriers; instead the daughters that are phenotypically normal and do not have affected offspring . Hypertrichosis of the ears , webbed toes , and porcupine man are examples of Y-linked inheritance in humans. Due to advancements in DNA sequencing, Y linkage is getting easier to determine and prove. The Y-chromosome is almost entirely mapped, revealing many Y-linked traits. Y linkage is similar to, but different from X linkage; although, both are forms of sex linkage. X linkage can be genetically linked and sex-linked, while Y linkage can only be genetically linked. This is because males' cells have only one copy of the Y-chromosome. X-chromosomes have two copies, one from each parent permitting recombination. The X chromosome contains more genes and is substantially larger. Y-chromosome deletions are a frequent genetic cause of male infertility.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Castleman disease Castleman disease has been divided into a solitary and a multicentric form . The solitary form presents as a mass located most commonly in the mediastinum , neck , lung , axilla , mesentery , broad ligament , and retroperitoneum . Grossly, it is round, well circumscribed, with a solid gray cut surface and measures >15 cm in diameter. The follicles show marked vascular proliferation and hyalinization of their abnormal or atrophic germinal centers, surrounded by concentrically arranged small lymphocytes imparting an \u201c onion-skin \u201d pattern. Remember angiolymphoid hyperplasia shows thick-walled blood vessels with prominent endothelial cells and inflammatory eosinophilia infiltrates .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Castleman disease (CD) is a rare, nonclonal lymphoproliferative disorder having distinct subtypes depending on its etiology, pathology, and clinical presentation. It can affect lymph nodes of any body region , imitating both benign and malignant malformations , including the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Pathologically it can be classified as hyaline vascular type (HV-CD) , plasma cell type , mixed type , and human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 associated Castleman disease . Clinically it manifests as the more common unicentric (localized or unifocal) Castleman disease (UCD) and the less common multicentric (generalized or multifocal) Castleman disease (MCD) . The hyaline vascular type has an increased number of lymphoid follicles with a broad mantle zone and hypoplastic germinal center. Centrally placed germinal center is surrounded with small lymphocytes arranged in concentric circles, forming an \" onion skin-like \" structure. The center of these follicles is penetrated by hyalinized capillaries resembling a \" lollipop \" (also known as the lollipop sign ). Strong endothelial vascular proliferation and hyalinization in the interfollicular zones along with a varying number of small lymphocytes and immature plasma cells, and prominent follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) occasionally appearing dysplastic can be seen. A high number of plasmacytoid dendritic cells can be found around these lesions. Mature lymphocyte infiltration can be observed in plasma cell CD with maintained mantle zone and germinal zone proportions. The interfollicular zones are filled with mature plasma cells and are less vascular than HV-CD. Sometimes irregular aggregates of polyclonal plasmablasts can be seen in the mantle zone of B-lymphocytes. The mixed type has the characteristics of both HV-CD and the plasma cell type . HHV-8 associated CD manifests as significant proliferation of angiogenesis between the lymphoid follicles with unclear boundaries and immature plasmablasts that might have restricted lambda light chains in specific immunoglobulins. Clinically, unicentric Castleman disease presents as a slow-growing, non-malignant painless solitary mass manifesting at a single anatomic site that is generally asymptomatic at first but starts producing symptoms when the surrounding structures are compressed due to its growing size. In contrast, multicentric CD occurs at multiple sites and is characterized by a proinflammatory response giving rise to the so-called B symptoms , including fever, night sweats, malaise, and weight loss . Exaggerated effects of elevated serum IL-6 levels cause various symptoms, including lymph node enlargement, hepatosplenomegaly, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia- owing to its growth and differentiation factors for both plasma and lymphocytes. Elevated fibrinogen levels cause deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolic disorders , high hepcidin levels cause anemia , increased VEGF levels result in angiogenesis and vascular permeability , which along with hypoalbuminemia induces edema , ascites , pleural and pericardial effusions , or even generalized anasarca .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

This interaction requires target cell membrane fluidity for its binding with natural killer cells. Emperipolesis is a heterogeneous cell in cell invasion in which engulfed cells are Hematopoietic. The cells are only temporarily internalised and are not destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: Phagocytosis. Incorrect , in phagocytosis the engulfed cell is killed by lysosomal enzymes of the macrophage, whereas the cell exists as a viable cell within another in emperipolesis. Option C: Autophagy. Incorrect , Autophagy is a self-degradative process that is important for balancing sources of energy at critical times in development and in response to nutrient stress. It also plays a housekeeping role in removing misfolded or aggregated proteins, clearing damaged organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes, as well as eliminating intracellular pathogens.

Allison and Tasuku Honjo \u201c for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation .\u201d Their pioneering work on the CTLA4 and PD1 immune checkpoints revealed that these pathways act as so-called \u201c brakes \u201d on the immune system, and showed that the inhibition of these checkpoint pathways allows T cells to more effectively eradicate cancer cells . This research laid the foundation for the clinical development of immune checkpoint inhibitors , which have dramatically improved outcomes for many people with cancer. James P. Allison studied a known protein that functions as a brake on the immune system. He realized the potential of releasing the brake and thereby unleashing our immune cells to attack tumors . Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoints are negative regulators of T-cell immune function . Inhibition of these targets, resulting in increased activation of the immune system, has led to new immunotherapies for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and other cancers . For several types of cancer, including lung cancer, renal cancer, lymphoma, and melanoma, checkpoint therapy against PD-l has proven more effective and positive results have been found. But recent clinical studies indicate that for melanoma the combination therapy of both CTLA-4 and PD-l is more effective . Thus, Allison and Honjo combined different strategies to release the brakes on the immune system with the aim of eliminating tumor cells even more efficiently. Their paper formed the basis of current cancer immunotherapy. But the original concept of cancer immunotherapy was discovered by William Bradley Coley (1872).
