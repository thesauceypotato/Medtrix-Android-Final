The term \" nosocomial \" comes from two Greek words: \"nosus\" meaning \"disease\" + \"komeion\" meaning \"to take care of.\" Hence, \"nosocomial\" should apply to any disease contracted by a patient while under medical care. However, common usage of the term \" nosocomial \" is now synonymous with hospital-acquired. Nosocomial infections are infections that have been caught in a hospital and are potentially caused by organisms that are resistant to antibiotics.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Criteria for Nosocomial infection:- A nosocomial infection is specifically one that was not present or incubating prior to the patient's being admitted to the hospital, but occurring after 48 hours after admittance to the hospital.

Aortic aneurysm may involve the aortic arch, thoracic aorta and or abdominal aorta. Atherosclerosis , the most common cause. It causes thinning and weakening of the media secondary to intimal plaques. Such plaques compress the underlying media. The media consequently undergoes degeneration and necrosis .

Plain X-Ray of the abdomen may show calcification within the wall of abdominal aorta aneurysms Electrocardiogram (ECG)may be performed to rule out evidence of myocardial infarction (MI) Echocardiography assists in the diagnosis of aortic valve insufficiency related to ascending aortic dilation. Ultrasonography is useful in screening for aneurysms and to serially monitor aneurysm size. CT scan is the most accurate test to determine the location and the presence of thrombus in the aneurysm.
