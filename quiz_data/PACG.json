      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Intravenous Mannitol Acute or congestive angle - closure glaucoma is caused by a sudden occlusion of the entire angle with a resultant acute rise of intraocular pressure to extremely high levels. Patients complain of a severe unilateral headache and diminution of vision in a \u2018red\u2019 eye. Nausea may be frequently associated. On examination, ciliary and conjunctival congestion , corneal oedema, a shallow anterior chamber, and iris bomb\u00e9 with a vertically oval, mid-dilated pupil are present.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The first drug to be administered in a case of acute ACG (angle closure glaucoma) is IV Mannitol or oral Acetazolamide . This helps to reduce the lOP by dehydrating and reducing the vitreous volume. Following this, pilocarpine eye drops are used to constrict the pupil and break the acute angle closure.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option : A . Treatment of lens - induced glaucoma is by extraction of the lens after lowering of the intraocular pressure by medical therapy. All lens matter must be evacuated. Insertion of a posterior chamber intraocular lens is not contraindicated. If not treated early, the outflow channels may be damaged, and long-term glaucoma medications or even glaucoma surgery may be required to control a chronically raised intraocular pressure. Option : C . Secondary angle - closure glaucoma may occur due to a pupillary block, following posterior synechiae to the intraocular lens or vitreous phase, and consequent bowing forwards of the iris. Mydriatics are used to break early posterior synechiae; however, if this is unsuccessful, it is mandatory to do a large Nd:YAG laser iridotomy or even multiple iridotomies to open loculated pockets of aqueous, after controlling the initial rise of intraocular pressure with medications. Postoperative pupillary block is commonly seen in diabetics. However, since this patient has an acute presentation with a classic history (middle aged female, symptoms started while watching a movie, Type A personality and clinical findings; the diagnosis of primary acute angle closure glaucoma is more appropriate. Option : D . Neovascular glaucoma is due to the presence of neovascularization over the iris (rubeosis iridis) and consequent fibrosis , leading to zip-like adhesions of the iris to the cornea at the angle. Anti - VEGF agents and retinal photocoagulation or cryotherapy are used to eliminate the stimulus for neovascularization. The raised intraocular pressure can then be alleviated by a trabeculectomy in conjunction with anti-fibroblastic agents or an anterior chamber drainage implant.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Pilocarpine is the definitive drug for Acute ACG. Finally, when the conjunctival oedema has resolved, the patient has to undergo laser iridotomy to prevent such attacks in future. A laser has to be done in the fellow eye also as the disease is bilateral. Hence, laser iridotomy is the definitive management of Acute ACG</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma This patient has acute angle-closure glaucoma (ACG) , presenting with headache, eye pain, nausea, and decreased visual acuity. ACG is characterized by narrowing of the anterior chamber angle, leading to decreased aqueous outflow and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). The incidence is higher in women (especially those over 40), Asian and Inuit populations, and individuals with farsightedness. Sudden angle closure can then occur due to pupillary dilation from anticholinergic medications (e.g., tolterodine), sympathomimetics, or low ambient light. Examination findings in ACG include conjunctival injection, corneal edema, palpable firmness of the eyeball, and a fixed, mid-dilated pupil.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Sulfonamides (e.g., trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole) can occasionally trigger ACG due to swelling of structures (eg, lens, retina, choroid) in the posterior chamber.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Cluster headaches can cause acute periorbital pain, conjunctival injections, and lacrimation. However, it is more common in young men and typically causes short-lived (minutes), recurrent attacks associated with autonomic symptoms (eg, miosis, lacrimation). Nausea / vomiting, and a fixed, mid dilated pupil are unexpected. Option: C. Migraine can cause headaches, nausea, and visual disturbances. However, it usually presents in adolescence or early adulthood, and this patient's red eye and nonreactive pupil are more consistent with ACG. Option: D. Giant cell ( temporal ) arteritis (GCA) presents in patients aged 50 with unilateral headache and can cause decreased visual acuity due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy . However, vomiting and conjunctival erythema are not typical. Although an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is sensitive for GCA, this test can be elevated in numerous other conditions (e.g., urinary tract infection), and older patients commonly have values above the reported laboratory reference.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In patients predisposed to ACG, the lens is located more forward against the iris, which impairs the normal flow of aqueous humour through the pupil into the anterior chamber, thereby increasing IOP.</p>\n<p></p>",

These features are consistent with acute angle - closure glaucoma Epinephrine is an alpha - adrenergic and beta - adrenergic receptor agonist. Epinephrine is used topically to treat open-angle glaucoma because alpha-1 receptor stimulation induces vasoconstriction and subsequently decreases aqueous humour production. Alpha-1 receptor agonism also causes pupillary dilation (mydriasis), which decreases the iridocorneal angle and subsequently decreases aqueous humour outflow.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>In individuals with angle-closure glaucoma, such as this patient, mydriasis can rapidly increase intraocular pressure and lead to permanent loss of vision. Therefore, epinephrine is contraindicated for this patient.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Timolol , a nonselective beta blocker, is commonly used in the treatment of acute angle-closure glaucoma because the inhibition of beta - 2 receptors decreases aqueous humour production and leads to contraction of the ciliary muscle. This process increases the pore size of the trabecular meshwork and subsequently increases aqueous outflow. Timolol should be avoided by individuals with asthma, COPD, or a heart block. Option: C. Apraclonidine , an alpha-2 agonist, is commonly used to acutely reduce intraocular pressure because it decreases aqueous humour production. Apraclonidine is a component of the treatment regimen for individuals with acute angle-closure glaucoma and would be indicated in this patient. This alpha-2 agonist should be avoided in individuals with hypersensitivity to apraclonidine or clonidine and in patients taking MAO inhibitors. Option: D. Acetazolamide reduces aqueous humour production via carbonic anhydrase inhibition and is often given in conjunction with other medications for the treatment of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Acetazolamide should be avoided in individuals with sulfa drug allergies, cirrhosis, or severe hypokalemia.</p>\n<p></p>",
