External Oblique & Internal Oblique , both of these muscles contribute to the abdominal wall's strength , but focusing solely on these two overlooks the importance of the transverse abdominis .

The perineal body is a fibromuscular mass located between the vaginal orifice and the anus . It is an important structure for the integrity of the perineum and is at risk of damage if a midline episiotomy extends . Damage to the perineal body can lead to weakness of the pelvic floor and associated complications. If the incision tears further during the delivery , a median incision is more likely than a posterolateral incision to extend posteriorly through the perineal body , the external anal sphincter , the internal anal sphincter , and the rectum .</li><li>\u2022 Option A.</li><li>\u2022 fibromuscular mass</li><li>\u2022 between</li><li>\u2022 vaginal orifice</li><li>\u2022 anus</li><li>\u2022 integrity</li><li>\u2022 perineum</li><li>\u2022 risk</li><li>\u2022 damage</li><li>\u2022 midline episiotomy extends</li><li>\u2022 perineal body</li><li>\u2022 weakness</li><li>\u2022 pelvic floor</li><li>\u2022 incision tears</li><li>\u2022 during</li><li>\u2022 delivery</li><li>\u2022 median incision</li><li>\u2022 posterolateral incision</li><li>\u2022 extend posteriorly</li><li>\u2022 perineal body</li><li>\u2022 external</li><li>\u2022 anal sphincter</li><li>\u2022 internal</li><li>\u2022 sphincter</li><li>\u2022 rectum</li><li>\u2022 Option B. In cases where a midline episiotomy extends or tears further, it can potentially involve the anterior wall of the rectum . This is particularly concerning as it can lead to complications like rectovaginal fistula . Serious tears may become infected by bowel contents , as may the child as it passes through the birth canal . This may delay or impair adequate healing for the mother or even present significant health risks (i.e. septicemia ) for mother or child .</li><li>\u2022 Option B.</li><li>\u2022 midline episiotomy</li><li>\u2022 extends</li><li>\u2022 tears</li><li>\u2022 potentially</li><li>\u2022 anterior wall</li><li>\u2022 rectum</li><li>\u2022 lead</li><li>\u2022 rectovaginal fistula</li><li>\u2022 Serious tears</li><li>\u2022 infected</li><li>\u2022 bowel contents</li><li>\u2022 birth canal</li><li>\u2022 delay</li><li>\u2022 impair</li><li>\u2022 healing</li><li>\u2022 mother</li><li>\u2022 significant health risks</li><li>\u2022 septicemia</li><li>\u2022 mother</li><li>\u2022 child</li><li>\u2022 Option D. The external anal sphincter is at risk of damage if a midline episiotomy tears further. This can lead to issues with fecal incontinence if the sphincter is significantly damaged . External anal sphincter forms the posterior relation of vagina , if torn in episiotomy can later lead to faecal incontinence . The integrity of the perineal body is critical to the strength of the entire perineum in women . Unrepaired injury can cause dysfunction of the external anal sphincter , internal anal sphincter , and/or sexual dysfunction (e.g., dyspareunia ).</li><li>\u2022 Option D.</li><li>\u2022 risk</li><li>\u2022 damage</li><li>\u2022 midline episiotomy</li><li>\u2022 tears</li><li>\u2022 fecal incontinence</li><li>\u2022 sphincter</li><li>\u2022 damaged</li><li>\u2022 External anal sphincter</li><li>\u2022 posterior relation</li><li>\u2022 vagina</li><li>\u2022 torn</li><li>\u2022 episiotomy</li><li>\u2022 lead</li><li>\u2022 faecal incontinence</li><li>\u2022 integrity</li><li>\u2022 perineal body</li><li>\u2022 critical</li><li>\u2022 strength</li><li>\u2022 entire perineum</li><li>\u2022 women</li><li>\u2022 Unrepaired injury</li><li>\u2022 dysfunction</li><li>\u2022 external anal sphincter</li><li>\u2022 internal anal sphincter</li><li>\u2022 sexual dysfunction</li><li>\u2022 dyspareunia</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The urethra, located anteriorly to the vaginal orifice , is generally not at risk of damage from a midline episiotomy.
