      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The transverse incision may be used in the elective situation Emergency tracheostomy : A vertical midline incision is made from the inferior aspect of the thyroid cartilage to the suprasternal notch and continues down between the infrahyoid muscles. The operator should feel cared for the cricoid cartilage using the free hand's index finger while retracting the skin edges by pressure applied by the thumb and middle finger. Should additional equipment and more time be available once the cricoid cartilage has been identified, blunt finger dissection inferiorly can mobilize the thyroid isthmus, which should be clipped and divided, clearing the trachea before making a vertical incision through the 2nd to 4th rings. Elective tracheostomy: A transverse incision may be used in the elective situation. The tracheal isthmus is divided carefully and oversewn and tension sutures have placed on either side of the tracheal fenestration in children. A Bjork flap may be used in adults.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Elective surgical procedures offer complete airway control, careful tube placement, and reduced complications. The patient is positioned with a head extension and sandbag under the shoulders. No head rotation or overextension in children. The transverse incision is used in elective situations. Thyroid isthmus divided and oversewn, tension sutures placed in children. Bjork flap may be used in adults, with advantages outweighing potential disadvantages. An inferiorly-based flap starts with an incision between the first and third tracheal rings. Avoid damage to the first tracheal ring to reduce subglottic stenosis risk. Stay suture inserted around the cartilage at the free edge of the flap. Lateral incisions are made in the caudal direction through two tracheal rings to create a flap. Stay suture can be attached and taped to the chest wall or flap sutured to the edge of the skin incision.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Pediatric patient: a vertical incision made between second and third tracheal rings. Before the tracheal incision, vertical stay sutures are placed lateral to midline through tracheal rings. Stay sutures provide traction and allow rapid reinsertion of the tracheostomy tube. Stick to the midline during dissection to avoid the risk of pneumothorax due to pleura cupula.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>To avoid subglottic stenosis Cricothyroidotomy has the advantages of speed and ease, requiring minimal equipment and surgical expertise, and has excellent value in the emergency setting when conditions are not optimal for performing a tracheostomy. The patient\u2019s neck is extended, and the area between the prominence of the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage below is palpated with the free hand's index finger. A vertical skin incision is recommended in an emergency, with dissection rapidly carried down to the cricothyroid membrane. A 1-cm transverse incision is made through the membrane immediately above the cricoid cartilage As soon as possible, the cricothyroidotomy should be converted to a tracheostomy . Although there is debate about the frequency of subglottic stenosis following this procedure, there is general agreement that it is much increased if any long-term ventilation is undertaken via even a modestly size tracheostomy tube through the cricothyroid membrane.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Cricothyroidotomy is done through the cricothyroid membrane. The membrane connects the thyroid cartilage to the cricoid cartilage. The cricothyroid artery and vein can cover the membrane, the pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland, and lymph nodes. Precise identification of the membrane is essential to avoid damaging nearby structures. The procedure involves extending the patient's neck and palpating the area between the thyroid cartilage and cricoid cartilage. The \"laryngeal handshake technique\" can be used to locate the membrane if necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Cricothyroidotomy can use a scalpel or cannulae. The fastest and most reliable method is the scalpel-bougie tube technique. The procedure requires a number 10 blade, bougie, and cuffed endotracheal tube, with the patient receiving 100% oxygen and complete neuromuscular blockade. A vertical skin incision is recommended, followed by a 1-cm transverse incision through the membrane above the cricoid cartilage. An artery forceps, bougie, dilator, or tracheal hook can improve aperture and tube insertion. Cannula cricothyroidotomy can use a narrow-bore or wide-bore cannula. Both techniques can lead to complications such as kinking of the cannula, device displacement, and barotrauma.</p>\n<p></p>",

The most common GI symptoms are the frequency of bowel movements and diarrhea. The patient also has tachycardia of 112/min and loss of weight despite a good appetite which is also a sign of hyperthyroidism. Widened pulse pressure also supports the diagnosis. A suppressed TSH diagnoses hyperthyroidism with or without elevated free T3 or T4. If eye signs are present, generally, other tests are not needed. If absent, an I 123 uptake scan should be performed. TSH is the single most appropriate investigation for this patient. The average value of TSH is 0.5-5 \u00b5u/ml.

The thyroid gland arises as an outpouching of the primitive foregut; endoderm cells in the floor of the pharyngeal anlage thicken to form the medial thyroid anlage that descends in the neck. During its descent, the anlage remains connected to the foramen cecum via an epithelial-lined tube known as the thyroglossal duct. The duct disappears by the eighth week of gestation. Rarely, the thyroglossal duct may persist in whole or in part. 80% thyroglossal duct cysts are found in juxtaposition to the hyoid bone.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Injury to this nerve can be due to improper ligation of the superior thyroid artery. The nerve injured in this case is the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN). The EBSLN innervates the cricothyroid muscles and contributes to vocal fold tone and tension. EBSLN injury leads to difficulty achieving high pitch, vocal projection, and volume. The recurrent laryngeal Nerve (RLN) is the more critical nerve and innervates the motor function of all of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles except for the cricothyroid. The RLN is most vulnerable to injury in the vicinity of the ligament of Berry. EBSLN runs quite close to the superior pole vessels and the upper thyroid lobe, so care must be taken when ligating and dividing the plates during thyroidectomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>RLNs are usually found at the cricoid cartilage level. Parathyroids are near the intersection of the inferior thyroid artery and the RLN, within 1 cm. The ligament of Berry is a vulnerable area for RLN injury, and any bleeding should be controlled gently before identifying and ligating the vessel. Avoid using electrocautery near the RLN. The thyroid can be separated from the trachea by sharp dissection once the ligament is divided.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. RLN is typically related to the tubercle of Zuckerkandl, which lies just anterior and lateral to the nerve. There is an intimate relationship between the RLN, Berry ligament, and the inferior thyroid artery at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Option: B. Recurrent laryngeal Nerve (RLN) innervates the motor function of all of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles except for the cricothyroid. Option: D. Bilateral RLN injury with subsequent bilateral vocal fold paralysis may require tracheostomy for airway control if the paralyzed vocal folds rest in a median position preventing adequate air exchange.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Dissect, skeletonize, ligate, and divide inferior thyroid vessels as close to the surface of the thyroid gland. This minimizes the devascularization of parathyroids and injury to RLN. Extracapsular dissection is recommended.</p>\n<p></p>",
