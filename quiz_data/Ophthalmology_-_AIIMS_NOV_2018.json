Hazy cornea with blue sclera , as seen in the picture, further confirms the diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Important Signs:- Corneal signs : Corneal signs include its oedema, enlargement and Descemet's breaks. Corneal oedema - It is frequently the first sign which arouses suspicion Corneal enlargement- It occurs along with enlargement of globe-buphthalmos especially when the onset is before the age of 3yrs Haab's striae ( Tears and break in Descement's membrane )- These occur because Descement's membrane is less elastic than the corneal stroma. Tears are usually peripheral and concentric with the limbus .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Pathogenesis Primary congenital glaucoma is due to failure or abnormal development of the trabecular meshwork Maldevelopment of trabeculae including:- The iridotrabecular junction (trabeculodysgenesis) is responsible for impaired aqueous outflow resulting in raised IOP. Trabeculodysgenesis is characterized by absence of the angle recess with iris having a flat or concave direct insertion into the surface. The iris may not completely separate from the corned that the angle remains closed by persistent embryonic tissue</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
