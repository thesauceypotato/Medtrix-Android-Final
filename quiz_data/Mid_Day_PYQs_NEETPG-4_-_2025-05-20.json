This blockade of acetylcholine release results in muscle paralysis, making botulinum toxin useful for medical and cosmetic purposes to treat conditions characterized by excessive muscle activity.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>\u21b3 Reference : Harper\u2019s 31 st ed/pg- 587</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
