      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Genitofemoral nerve Genitofemoral nerve is blocked when the local anesthesia is given just below the inguinal ligament during femoral vein catheterisation. The genitofemoral nerve originates from L1 and L2 ventral rami , divides into genital and femoral branches after crossing behind the ureter. Genitofemoral nerve gives sensory supply to the anterolateral thigh via the femoral branch. The genital branch supplies skin of the scrotum in males and mons pubis and labia majora in females. It also innervates the cremaster muscle via the genital branch and is responsible for the cremasteric reflex.</p>\n<p></p>",
