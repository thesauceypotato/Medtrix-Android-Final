They swing from being excessively dependent to being hostile to persons close to them. Hence, they have a history of unstable relationships . Another characteristic feature is the repetitive self-destructive acts such as the slashing of wrists, or overdosage of medications. The patients indulge in these behaviors to elicit help from others, to express their anger or just to numb themselves to the overwhelming painful feelings they have. These patients are also impulsive in areas such as spending, sex, and substance use.
