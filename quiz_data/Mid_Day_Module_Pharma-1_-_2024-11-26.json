Is the same as bioavailability:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Is the same as bioavailability:</li><li>\u2022 This statement is incorrect. Bioavailability refers to the fraction of an administered dose of a drug that reaches the systemic circulation in its active form . In contrast, plasma half-life is the time required for the concentration of the drug in the plasma to reduce to half its original value. These are distinct pharmacokinetic properties.</li><li>\u2022 Bioavailability</li><li>\u2022 fraction of an administered dose</li><li>\u2022 drug that reaches the systemic circulation</li><li>\u2022 active form</li><li>\u2022 Option B. It is directly proportional to clearance:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. It is directly proportional to clearance:</li><li>\u2022 This is incorrect. Plasma half-life is inversely related to clearance . Clearance is the rate at which a drug is removed from the body. If a drug is cleared quickly from the body (high clearance), its plasma half-life will be shorter, and vice versa.</li><li>\u2022 Plasma half-life is inversely related to clearance</li><li>\u2022 Option C. It is inversely proportional to volume of distribution:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. It is inversely proportional to volume of distribution:</li><li>\u2022 This statement is actually a misunderstanding. Plasma half-life is not solely dependent on the volume of distribution . The relationship between half-life, volume of distribution, and clearance is given by the formula: half-life = (0.693 \u00d7 volume of distribution) / clearance. Thus, half-life is directly proportional to the volume of distribution and inversely proportional to clearance.</li><li>\u2022 Plasma half-life is not solely dependent on the volume of distribution</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective</li><li>\u27a4 For drugs eliminated via first-order kinetics , the plasma half-life remains constant because a fixed percentage of the drug is metabolized per unit time , regardless of the drug's concentration in the plasma.</li><li>\u27a4 drugs eliminated via first-order kinetics</li><li>\u27a4 plasma half-life remains constant</li><li>\u27a4 fixed percentage of the drug</li><li>\u27a4 metabolized per unit time</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
