Clusters of budding yeast-like cells and short and occasionally branching hyphae are described as the \u2018spaghetti and meatball\u2019 Spores = Meatballs and Pseudohyphae = spaghetti. Treatment - Selenium sulfide and topical antifungal Macules and patches affecting the trunk, neck, and face with overlying fine scaling Branny scale or Powdery scales occur in this disease Both hypopigmented > hyperpigmented lesions are seen Common site involved is upper trunk Psoriasis: Pink-red, silvery scale, sharply demarcated Sites: Elbows, knees, scalp, presacral area, intergluteal fold When the membrane is removed, pin point bleeding spots are seen: Auspitz signs Pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC): It is a skin condition that is characterized by the appearance of small, scaly, and itchy papules on the skin. Age: Typically affects young adults and is more common in males than females. Features: Persistent itchy lesions, Mica like scales</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Gottron Papules Gottron papules are one of the most characteristic findings in juvenile dermatomyositis. These are violaceous papules that are usually seen over the metacarpophalangeal area , the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of hands, and less commonly, in the extensor surfaces of elbows and knees.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Dermatomyositis Dermatomyositis (DM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy characterised by skeletal muscle weakness and skin changes. Genetic predisposition: PTPN22 gene and HLA associations Cutaneous Features: Heliotrope rash: Bilateral discolouration of the eyelids with swelling of eyelids and skin around the eyes. Shawl sign: Fixed redness affecting the back, shoulder, and chest Photosensitivity: Sunreaction over the \u2018V area\u2019 Gottron Papules: Violaceous papules over the joints of hands Gottron sign: Redness over knees, elbows, knees Nailfold changes: Loss of cuticles/ragged cuticles with nail fold redness Nail fold dermoscopy: Shows dilated capillaries Calcinosis cutis Raynaud phenomenon Mechanic's hands : hyperkeratotic, cracked horizontal lines on the palmar and lateral aspects of the fingers. Flagellate erythema : characterised by multiple, red, macular streaks occurring on the trunk and proximal limbs. The stripes are aligned diagonally giving the appearance of whipping. Myositis of dermatomyositis Muscle weakness appears at the same time as the skin rash It usually affects proximal muscles Muscle pain and tenderness may be present</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Malar rash: It is aka butterfly rash, and is a common facial presentation of multiple disorders. It is characterized by erythematous flat photosensitive lesions. Option B. Photosensitivity: It can be seen in multiple conditions like SLE, dermatitis, migraine, dermatomyositis, Darier\u2019s disease, etc. Option C. Nailfold capillaries: Nail fold capillary abnormalities are present in more than 95% of patients with systemic sclerosis. Nailfold capillary changes may be present in dermatomyositis but are not characteristic.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Inflammatory myopathy Dermatomyositis Inclusion body myositis Polymyositis Onset -Juvenile dermatomyositis - around 7 years of age ( Most common inflammatory myopathy in children) -Adult dermatomyositis - 4th to 6th decade Elderly, > 50 years (Most common inflammatory myopathy in adults) >18 years Cutaneous involvement Present Absent Absent Myositis Symmetric Asymmetric Symmetric Histopathological findings -Perimysial CD4+ T cellular infiltrate -Perivascular infiltrates and perifascicular atrophy - Endomysial CD8+ cellular infiltrate -Perivascular infiltrates with amyloid inclusion bodies and rimmed vacuoles - Endomysial CD8+ cellular infiltrate -Perivascular infiltrates Association Ovarian and other internal malignancy Infrequent Other autoimmune diseases and sometimes with internal malignancy Steroid/ Immunotherapy Responsive Resistant Responsive</p>\n<p></p>",
