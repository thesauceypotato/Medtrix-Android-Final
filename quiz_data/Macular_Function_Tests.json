      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pelli Robson Charts Pelli Robson Charts are used for testing Contrast Sensitivity . Functional Acuity Contrast Tests and Cambridge contrast sensitivity tests are some of the other examples. It measures contrast sensitivity using a single large letter size (20/60 optotype) with contrast varying across groups of letters(6 per line ) arranged in groups whose contrast varies from high to low. Patients read the letters, starting with the highest contrast , until they can read two or three letters in a single group.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>A score of less than 1.5 is consistent with visual impairment , with a score of less than 1.0 representing visual disability.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option:A.
