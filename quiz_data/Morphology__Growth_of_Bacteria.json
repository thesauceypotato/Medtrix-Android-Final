The difference between quality assurance and testing is that quality assurance is about the activities designed to ensure the project conforms to the stakeholders' expectations. At the same time, the test is a process of exploring a system to find defects. Whereas QA is proactive, QC is reactive. Testing is a subset of QC. It is the process of executing a system to detect bugs in the product so that they get fixed.

During conjugation (sexual reproduction), two ciliates come in contact, forming a cytoplasmic bridge between them.
