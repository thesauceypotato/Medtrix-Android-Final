The above description with central detachment and peripheral attachment of scales with the images suggestive of collarette scales and lesions in christmas tree pattern is suggestive of pityriasis rosea. Pityriasis rosea/pityriasis circinata/roseola annulata is an acute self-limiting papulosquamous disorder. It is commonly seen in children and young adults. Clinical features include: Prodrome of a sore throat, gastrointestinal disturbance, fever or arthralgia. Herald patch - Large and conspicuous eruptions on the thigh, upper arm, trunk or neck covered by fine scales The image given below shows a herald patch. After 5-15 days, it turns into discrete oval lesions, dull pink in color and covered by fine dry silvery-grey scales. These secondary lesions occur as macules and papules that are elliptical or ovular, symmetric, and commonly involve the thorax, back, and abdomen. It is followed by a marginal collarette of scale with a central wrinkling and atrophy. The collarettes of the scales are attached peripherally. It is also called a hanging curtain sign. The image given below shows collarette scales. The long axes of the lesions characteristically follow the lines of skin tension parallel to the ribs in a Christmas tree pattern on the upper chest and back.

They are commonly seen on the volar aspect of the wrists, the lumbar region, and around the ankles. The mucosal involvement is seen. The commonest mucosal sites are buccal mucosa and tongue, rarely it can also be found on the anus and genitalia.</p>\n<p></p>",

Alopecia areata It is a chronic inflammatory disease that causes non-scarring hair loss . It is a T-cell- mediated inflammatory disease. It is associated with several autoimmune diseases, including thyroiditis, lupus erythematosus, vitiligo, and psoriasis. It mainly affects the scalp, but can also affect the beard, eyebrows , and eyelashes. In some cases, this progresses to a total loss of scalp hair (alopecia totalis) or a loss of all hair on the body (alopecia universalis). Telogen effluvium It is a type of nonscarring alopecia that is marked by diffuse shedding of normal hair. This occurs due to premature termination of the anagen phase of the hair cycle. It can be either acute or chronic. Acute telogen effluvium occurs 2-3 months after a stressful event such as high fever, surgery, starvation, and hemorrhage. Hormonal fluctuations during the postpartum period can trigger it (telogen gravidarum). Telogen effluvium can result in a diffuse reduction in hair density but never total baldness. It generally resolves spontaneously. Chronic telogen effluvium is used to describe the diffuse shedding of telogen hair for more than 6 months. Common causes include thyroid disorders, iron-deficiency anemia, and malnutrition. Androgenetic alopecia It is a disorder characterized by a reduction of hair fiber production by follicles and miniaturization. Dihydrotestosterone , an androgenic metabolite, is implicated in the etiology. It is of two types: male-pattern and female-pattern hair loss. Male-pattern hair loss causes frontal hairline recession and thinning of the vertex. Female-pattern hair loss involves the mid-frontal scalp diffusely. There is no or minimal involvement of the temporal region. CICATRICIAL/SCARRING ALOPECIA: Frontal fibrosing alopecia is a primary cicatrical condition that affects post-menopausal women in particular and frequently involves the eyebrows.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Scarring / Cicatricial alopecia Non Scarring / Non Cicatricial alopecia Hair follicles destroyed Hair follicles not destroyed Skin appears shiny with follicular openings not visible Follicular openings are visible Signs of inflammation are present in forms of papules, pustules and hyperpigmentation Inflammation absent Irreversible Reversible Scleroderma Tinea capitis(Inflammatory Type - Kerion) Folliculitis Decalvans DLE Lupus Vulgaris Lichen Planopilaris Frontal fibrosing alopecia Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia Radiation therapy and Chronic infections Tinea capitis(Non Inflammatory Type) Hormonal - Hypothyroidism, Androgenetic alopecia Anagen effluvium, Alopecia areata, Telogen effluvium Trichotillomania Secondary syphilis (moth eaten alopecia) SLE Deficiency of Zinc, Iron</p>\n<p></p>",
