In India, there are only 5 varieties which are dangerously poisonous: Common Cobra; Common Krait; King Cobra; Russell's Viper; Saw scaled Viper. Cobra snake has a long and cylindrical body with a small head that is seldom broader than the body, covered by large scales or shields of special forms; Russel Viper has a flat, heavy and triangular head with a white V-shaped mark, the angle of the V pointing forwards. It has 3 rows of diamond-shaped black or brown spots along the back, the outer 2 rows consisting of spots ringed with white edges. Common Krait is steel-blue, often shining and has single or double white bands across the back and a creamy white belly. Its length is one to one and a half metres. 4 shields are found on either side of the lower lip. Venom is the saliva of the snake. Cobra venom is faint transparent yellow and is slightly viscous, when exposed to the sun it becomes turbid. Russel\u2019s viper venom is white or yellow. The fatal period for Cobra is half to six hrs; for Viper is 1-2 days. For diagnosis, snake-specific venom antigens are detected in wound swabs, serum, biopsies, urine etc. along with the underlying tissue and skin of the bite mark; RIA(Radioimmunoassay) is the most sensitive and specific test and it can detect venom levels of 0.4ug/l; enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is commonly used as it is simple and can detect venom levels of 5ug/l; immunological detection of small amounts of venom antigens in body fluids can be done by ELISA. First aid- Assure the patient, and apply firm pressure over the bitten area which delays the absorption of venom. Pressure immobilisation is recommended by applying a broad firm bandage (Sutherland wrap), and the pressure of 50- 70 mm Hg is maintained. Cauterisation, Cryotherapy and sucking of venom through the mouth should not be done. Treatment- PAV (Polyvalent Antisnake Venom) is used which is prepared by hyper-immunising horses against the venom of 4 snakes only- Cobra; Common krait; Russell\u2019s Viper; Saw scaled viper.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>In viper bite, there is discolouration, swelling and cellulitis above the mark and haemorrhage occurs from the puncture and mucous membranes. It was a case of Snake bite poisoning as indicated by the image and the clinical features as mentioned in the case scenario. Poisonous snakes leave 2 or occasionally one fang mark; Non-poisonous snakes leave a semicircular set of tooth marks. The punctures are one and a half cm deep in colubrine and two and a half cm deep in viperine bites. For diagnosis, snake-specific venom antigens are detected in wound swabs, serum, biopsies, urine etc. along with the underlying tissue and skin of the bite mark; RIA(Radioimmunoassay) is a most sensitive and specific test and it can detect venom levels of 0.4ug/l; enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is commonly used as it is simple and can detect venom levels of 5ug/l; immunological detection of small amounts of venom antigens in body fluids can be done by ELISA. More than 50% of the victims of Viper Bites have minimal or no poisoning, as little or no venom is injected. About 25% will develop serious generalised poisoning. When venom is injected, the spot develops severe pain within 8 minutes. The onset of swelling starts within fifteen minutes and there is often blood-stained discharge from the wound. Blisters begin to appear in about 12hrs in and around the bite site, progressing subsequently to involve the entire limb. In a colubrine bite, the site of the bite contains fluid and haemolysed blood causing staining of vessels. In viperine bite, there is discolouration, swelling and cellulitis about the mark and haemorrhages occur from the puncture and mucous membranes. Haemorrhages into the bowel, purpuric spots on the pericardium, and haemorrhages in the lungs and in many tissues may be seen. Kidneys are inflamed and show marked congestion. Subcapsular pinpoint haemorrhages are seen in most cases of viperine bite. Acute renal failure is the leading cause of death in viper bite. Internal organs are congested. Washing from the bite area may contain cholinesterase or thromboplastin. The skin and underlying tissue surrounding fang marks should be removed for analysis. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) can identify the nature of venom from the bite site.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. Poisonous snakes leave 2 or occasionally one fang mark; Non-poisonous snakes leave a semicircular set of tooth marks. Option B. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) can identify the nature of venom from the bite site as immunological detection of small amounts of venom antigens in body fluids can be done by ELISA. Option D. Acute renal failure is the leading cause of death in viper bite. Internal organs are congested.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1,3,5 The case is the bite of a non- poisonous snake as indicated by the image of the bite mark. Poisonous snakes leave 2 or occasionally one fang mark; Non-poisonous snakes leave a semicircular set of tooth marks. The punctures are one and a half cm deep in colubrine and two and a half cm deep in viperine bites. Cobra snake has a long and cylindrical body with a small head that is seldom broader than the body, covered by large scales or shields of special forms; Russel Viper has a flat, heavy and triangular head with a white V-shaped mark, the angle of the V pointing forwards. It has 3 rows of diamond-shaped black or brown spots along the back, the outer 2 rows consisting of spots ringed with white edges. Cobra- the local symptoms start within 6-8 minutes; a small reddish wheal develops at the site of the bite. The bitten area is tender with a burning pain. Early symptoms include nausea and vomiting. The patient feels sleepy, and intoxicated, has weakness in his legs, and is reluctant to move or stand. Ptosis is the earliest neuroparalytic manifestation followed by ophthalmoplegia, extraocular weakness and strabismus are seen. Paralysis spreads from the lower limbs to the trunk and then to the head. Krait signs and symptoms are similar to cobra poisoning, there is no nausea and froth, but drowsiness is more. Viper- More local reaction is seen along with pain and oozing, local necrosis is extensive which may lead to gangrene. Bilateral parotid swelling (Viper head), conjunctival edema and subconjunctival haemorrhages are seen. Sea snake- The bite is usually painless with minimal or no local swelling or involvement of local lymph nodes. Generalised rhabdomyolysis occurs. 20 min whole blood clotting test (20 WBCT): This is a very useful and informative bedside test. Place a few ml of freshly sampled venous blood in a clean, dry, glass tube/bottle. Leave it undisturbed for 20 min at room temperature. Gently invert the tube. If the blood is still unclotted and runs out, the patient has hypofibrinogenemia as a result of venom-induced consumption coagulopathy. A normal 20 WBCT and clot lysis would exclude Viperidae species. A single breath counting test is done in suspected elapidae bites, and the same is repeated at 15 min intervals over the first 2 h.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B. Krait, sea snake and single breath counting test are wrongly matched to their explanations. Option C. Krait and the sea snake are wrongly matched to their explanations. Option D. Sea snake- The bite is usually painless with minimal or no local swelling or involvement of local lymph nodes is the correct explanation which is not given.</p>\n<p></p>",
