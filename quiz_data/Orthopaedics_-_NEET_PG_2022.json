      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Malunion, Cubitus Varus Given image favors the diagnosis of supracondylar fracture of humerus; which refers to transverse or oblique fracture of the distal humerus just above the elbow joint. Malunion leading to cubitus varus in association with AIN injury is the most common complication if this fracture is left untreated. Neuropraxia associated with supracondylar fracture of humerus: anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) neurapraxia (branch of median n.): most common nerve palsy seen with supracondylar humerus fractures Unable to flex the interphalangeal joint of the thumb and the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger (can't make A-OK sign) Radial nerve palsy: second most common neuropraxia Loss of sensation over volar index finger</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION B: Cubitus valgus is one of the most common complications seen with untreated radial head dislocation. OPTION C : Ulnar nerve palsy seen with flexion-type injury patterns Inability to extend wrist, MCP joints, thumb IP joint; while PIP and DIP can still be extended via intrinsic function (ulnar nerve) OPTION D : Myositis ossificans is a reactive soft tissue bone-forming process that commonly occurs following a traumatic event to soft tissues and is typically seen with a history of fracture in children or adolescents improperly treated by massage or intensive stretching.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA IMPORTANT CONDITIONS OF THE ELBOW Little leaguer's elbow Partial avulsion of the medial epicondyle Javelin thrower's elbow Avulsion of the tip of olecranon due to overarm action Student's elbow/Miner's elbow Olecranon bursitis Pulled elbow/Nurse maid's elbow Downward dislocation of the radial head from the annular ligament</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Spanning External Fixator \u2013 Peri Articular Fracture Knee Given image shows a joint spanning/bridging external fixator. A joint-spanning external fixator is fixed to the bones forming the joint from both sides (femur and the tibia) while the fracture zone is left virtually untouched (it is bridged). It may be used on its own or to supplement K-wire fixation and is specifically preferred in periarticular fractures of knee or wrist. (Thus Option C is a better choice than A or B in this case.)</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option D: The Ilizarov apparatus (circular external fixator, 3 rd generation fixation technique) is used to lengthen or reshape limb bones/long bones; treat complex and/or open bone fractures; and in cases of infected non-unions of bones that are not amenable with other techniques. It is not usually preferred for periarticular fractures. OPTION A and B is not the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA #instruments in orthopedics PERIOSTEAL ELEVATOR CURETTE OSTEOTOME BONE GAUGE BONE NIBBLER BONE AND PLATE HOLDING FORCEP</p>\n<p></p>",

Option C: Pulmonary hypertension may be seen with similar signs and symptoms but the classic history of right ventricular failure and associated signs and symptoms would be seen instead of history of fracture before 2 days.
