When a hormone binds to its receptor, the associated heterotrimeric G protein undergoes a conformational change. This change leads to the exchange of GDP for GTP on the G protein's alpha subunit, causing it to dissociate from the beta and gamma subunits.</li><li>\u2022 The activated GTP-bound alpha subunit then interacts with adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme located on the inner membrane of the cell. Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP). The newly formed cAMP acts as a secondary messenger that activates Protein Kinase A (PKA). PKA, in turn, phosphorylates various target proteins, leading to a cascade of cellular responses.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The correct sequence in the G protein-coupled receptor pathway is: Adenylyl cyclase activates the conversion of ATP to cAMP, which then activates Protein Kinase A (PKA).</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
