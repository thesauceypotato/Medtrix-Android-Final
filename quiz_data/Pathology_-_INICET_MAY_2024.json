Lung: It is the commonest site of primary tuberculosis. Ghon lesion: Following inhalation, tubercle bacilli gets deposited in the distal airspaces. Site of deposit: Usually lower part of the upper lobe or upper part of the lower lobe near the pleural surface (subpleural). Ghon focus: About 2\u20134 weeks after the infection, a circumscribed gray-white area of about 1\u20131.5 cm develops in the lung known as the Ghon focus\u2192 the center of which undergoes caseous necrosis. Regional lymphadenitis: Tubercle bacilli (free or within macrophages) are carried along the lymphatics to the regional draining nodes \u2192 which often show caseous necrosis. Histology Caseating granuloma consists of: Central area of caseous necrosis Surrounded by epithelioid cells (modified macrophages), some of which may fuse to form multinucleate giant cells . The giant cells may be Langhans type (nuclei arranged in horseshoe pattern) or foreign body type (nuclei in the center). The epithelioid cells are surrounded by rim of lymphocytes.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B.
