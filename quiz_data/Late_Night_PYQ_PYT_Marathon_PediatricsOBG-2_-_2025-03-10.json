Lochia is the vaginal discharge that occurs for the first few weeks during the puerperium, the period following childbirth when the mother's body, including hormone levels and uterus size, returns to a non-pregnant state. The discharge originates from the uterine body, cervix, and vagina and is a mix of blood, mucus, and uterine tissue.</li><li>\u2022 Lochia has a peculiar offensive fishy smell and an alkaline reaction that tends to become acidic towards the end of the discharge period. Depending on the color variation of the discharge, it is categorized as follows:</li><li>\u2022 Lochia rubra (red): Occurs during the first 1-4 days postpartum and is primarily composed of blood, making it bright red in color. Lochia serosa: Occurs from days 5-9 postpartum, with the color transitioning to yellowish, pink, or pale brownish due to the decreasing amount of blood and increasing mucus and leukocytes. Lochia alba (pale white): Occurs from days 10-15 postpartum and consists mainly of white blood cells, mucus, and epithelial cells, giving it a pale white appearance.</li><li>\u2022 Lochia rubra (red): Occurs during the first 1-4 days postpartum and is primarily composed of blood, making it bright red in color.</li><li>\u2022 Lochia rubra (red):</li><li>\u2022 Lochia serosa: Occurs from days 5-9 postpartum, with the color transitioning to yellowish, pink, or pale brownish due to the decreasing amount of blood and increasing mucus and leukocytes.</li><li>\u2022 Lochia serosa:</li><li>\u2022 Lochia alba (pale white): Occurs from days 10-15 postpartum and consists mainly of white blood cells, mucus, and epithelial cells, giving it a pale white appearance.</li><li>\u2022 Lochia alba (pale white):</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 5-15 days : This duration is shorter than the average period of lochial discharge, which generally extends beyond 15 days.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 5-15 days</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 10-20 days : This duration is also shorter than the typical 24-36 days for lochial discharge.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 10-20 days</li><li>\u2022 Option D. 36-42 days : While some women may experience lochial discharge for this duration, it is longer than the average duration of 24-36 days.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. 36-42 days</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The average duration of lochia discharge in a puerperal woman is about 24-36 days.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Dutta\u2019s textbook of obstetrics 8 th edition Page170</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Dutta\u2019s textbook of obstetrics 8 th edition Page170</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

It has several maternal side effects. Maternal hyperglycemia is a known complication of ritodrine because it stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Maternal side effects include: Headache, palpitations: Common side effects due to beta-agonist action. Tachycardia and hypotension: These cardiovascular effects are due to beta-agonist properties. Hyperglycemia: Caused by increased glucose production and decreased insulin sensitivity. Hypocalcemia: Resulting from increased calcium excretion. Hypomagnesemia: Due to increased renal excretion of magnesium. Pulmonary edema: A serious complication caused by fluid retention and increased capillary permeability. Neonatal side effects : Hypoglycemia : Occurs due to high insulin levels in response to maternal hyperglycemia. Intraventricular hemorrhage : Related to hemodynamic instability caused by tocolytic therapy. Fetal side effects : Tachycardia : Due to beta-agonist crossing the placenta. Heart failure : Resulting from sustained tachycardia and cardiac workload.</li><li>\u2022 Ritodrine is a beta-agonist used to prevent preterm labor by relaxing uterine muscles.

These drugs help to slow down bone resorption, thus preserving bone density. The recommended duration of bisphosphonate therapy is generally 3-5 years, not limited to just 1 year.

Complete mole is triploid, partial mole is diploid: This statement is incorrect. A complete mole is diploid (46XX or 46XY), typically arising from fertilization of an egg with no genetic material by one or two sperm.

Multi-agent chemotherapy is indicated in low-risk choriocarcinoma</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Lung metastases indicate a high-risk tumor : This statement is incorrect.
