The Water's view is an X-ray technique used to visualize the maxillary sinuses. The patient is positioned with the head tilted forward over the edge of the examination table. The X-ray beam is directed through the open mouth, which allows for a frontal view of the maxillary sinuses. Option B: Caldwell View: This is not the correct answer either. The Caldwell view is a radiographic projection used to visualize the frontal sinuses and orbital rims. In this view, the patient's head is tilted backward, and the X-ray beam is directed through the forehead, producing an image of the frontal sinuses. Option C: Towne's View: This is not the correct answer. The Towne's view, also known as the Posteroanterior (PA) axial view, is primarily used for imaging the skull base, particularly the occipital bone and foramen magnum. It involves angling the X-ray beam from a posterior-to-anterior direction, creating an image that highlights the base of the skull.</p>\n<p></p>",

Development of phylogenetically older part of labyrinth\u2014pars superior (semicircular canals and utricle) takes place earlier than pars inferior (saccule and cochlea).
