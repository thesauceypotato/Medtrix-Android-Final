      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Clouding of the maxillary sinus The patient's findings of enophthalmos (posteriorly displaced eye) and infraorbital rim tenderness suggest an orbital floor fracture (orbital blowout fracture) . The mechanism of this injury can lead to downward displacement of orbital fat and inferior rectus muscle entrapment, which in turn can cause impaired upward gaze</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Maxillary Sinus Mucocele as a Late Complication in Zygomatic-Orbital Complex Fracture .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A .Injuring the lacrimal duct system is associated with nasoethmoidal Fracture of the maxillary bone in this portion of the medial orbital rim can also disrupt the medial canthal ligament, causing eyelid displacement and entrapment of the medial rectus muscle, which would prevent horizontal eye movement. Nasoethmoidal fractures are the second most common orbital fractures after orbital floor fractures. Still, this patient has no accompanying signs, and such a fracture would not explain his limited upward gaze or inferior orbital rim tenderness. Option: B . Pneumatization of the frontal sinus is a part of normal development as bone marrow in the frontal sinuses is slowly replaced by air from 2 years of age until adolescence. Pneumatization of the frontal sinuses may also occur due to orbital trauma in orbital roof fractures. These fractures are rare in adults because of the strength of the orbital roof. They are more common in children with a higher cranium-to-midface ratio than in Orbital roof fractures result in CSF leaks and mucocele formation , none of which are present in this patient. Option: D. Cerebrospinal fluid leak is seldom associated with orbital fractures. When a CSF leak does occur, it is typically due to an orbital roof fracture with an extension to the frontal sinuses. Orbital roof fracture is inconsistent with this patient's inferior orbital rim tenderness and limitation of upward gaze (signifying inferior rectus muscle entrapment).</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Clouding of the maxillary sinus is a radiological sign known as the \"teardrop sign.\" It will likely be seen on further evaluation due to the inferior rectus muscle and orbital fat herniating through the fractured orbital floor.</p>\n<p></p>",
