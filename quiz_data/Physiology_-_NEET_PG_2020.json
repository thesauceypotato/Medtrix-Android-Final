NREM stage 1: This is the initial stage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. It lasts for a short period, usually a few minutes. In this stage, the person is in a transitional state between wakefulness and sleep. The brain produces slower brainwave patterns, and the person may experience mild drowsiness. It is relatively easy to wake someone up during this stage. Option: B. NREM stage 2: This is the second stage of NREM sleep and typically occurs after stage 1. It makes up a significant portion of the sleep cycle, around 45-55%. In stage 2, brainwave patterns continue to slow down, and there may be occasional bursts of rapid brainwave activity known as sleep spindles. The body temperature drops, heart rate and breathing become regular, and eye movements cease. It becomes harder to wake someone up during this stage compared to stage 1. Option: C. NREM stage 3: This is the deepest stage of NREM sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep (SWS) or delta sleep. It is the stage where the brain produces slow, high-amplitude delta waves. This stage is crucial for physical restoration and repair, as well as for memory consolidation. It is the most difficult stage to wake someone up from, and if awakened, they may feel disoriented or groggy. Growth hormone is also released during this stage, supporting tissue repair and growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Sleep physiology Sleep cycle is regulated by the circadian rhythm, which is driven by suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus.

Type II alveolar cells are involved in the secretion of surfactant proteins Type 2 alveolar cells secrets surfactant which prevent the alveoli from collapsing If surfactant is deficient baby may develops Respiratory distress syndrome In RDS, there is a lack or inadequate production of surfactant, leading to difficulty in expanding the lungs and exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide effectively. This condition is more common in premature infants whose lungs have not yet fully developed. Important Note :- The primary alveoli develop and the production of the surfactant begins by week 20-24. However, it does not reach the lungs until later. The surfactant appears in the amniotic fluid between 28 and 32 weeks of gestation . Mature levels of the pulmonary surfactant are present usually after 35 weeks of gestation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Type 1 alveolar cell: Type 1 alveolar cells are responsible for the structural integrity of the alveoli and their function is to facilitate gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. They form a thin layer of cells that line the alveoli and are involved in the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. These cells are not directly involved in the production of surfactant, so a deficiency in Type 1 alveolar cells would not be the cause of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS). Option: C. Alveolar capillary endothelial cells: Alveolar capillary endothelial cells line the blood vessels surrounding the alveoli and are involved in the exchange of gases between the lungs and bloodstream. They help facilitate the transfer of oxygen from the alveoli into the bloodstream and the removal of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the alveoli. While dysfunction in these cells can impact gas exchange, it is not directly related to the production of surfactant, which is the primary issue in RDS. Option: D. Bronchial mucosal epithelial cell: Bronchial mucosal epithelial cells are found in the lining of the larger airways, such as the bronchi. They produce mucus that helps to trap foreign particles and keep the airways moist. While dysfunction in these cells can lead to respiratory problems and difficulties in clearing mucus, they are not directly involved in surfactant production, which is the primary concern in RDS.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Pulmonary Surfactant Composition Phospholipids, mainly dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) :- 70-80% Neutral lipids:- 10% Proteins :- 10%</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

The small intestine is not directly involved in regulating bowel movements, and its removal would not directly cause constipation. Option: C. Gastric ulcers are not related to the resection of the ileum and jejunum. Gastric ulcers primarily occur in the stomach and are often associated with factors like infection with Helicobacter pylori or the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Option: D. Diarrhea is not commonly associated with the resection of the ileum and jejunum. In fact, the removal of a significant portion of the small intestine can sometimes lead to malabsorption, which can result in loose stools, but chronic diarrhea is not a typical outcome.

When the duodenum detects the presence of acid or hypertonicity, it sends signals to the stomach via the enterogastric reflex to slow down gastric emptying. This reflex helps to regulate the rate at which food leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine, allowing for proper digestion and absorption.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>When this enterogastric reflex is stimulated, the release of gastrin from G- cells in the antrum of the stomach is shut off. In turn, this inhibits gastric motility and the secretion of gastric acid (HCl). The gastroileal reflex is a third type of gastrointestinal reflex. It works with the gastrocolic reflex to stimulate the urge to defecate The myenteric plexus extends throughout the entire length of the gut as a linear chain of interconnected neurons. Lying within intestinal smooth muscle, the myenteric plexus focuses on muscle control.

Defect in the node of Ranvier: The nodes of Ranvier are the small gaps in the myelin sheath where the axon is exposed.

Option D Factor 5: Factor 5 is another clotting factor that is not directly affected by warfarin therapy. It is a cofactor for the enzyme that activates Factor 10 in the common pathway of the coagulation cascade. Factor 5 does not undergo gamma carboxylation and, therefore, is not influenced by warfarin's effects on vitamin K-dependent processes.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Bulging of tricuspid valve during the isovolumetric contraction phase During the isovolumetric contraction phase, the ventricles are contracting, but the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonic valves) are still closed. As the ventricles contract, the pressure within the ventricles increases. This increased pressure causes the tricuspid valve, which lies between the right atrium and right ventricle, to bulge backward into the right atrium. This bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium creates a temporary increase in jugular venous pressure, leading to the C wave in the JVP waveform.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The jugular venous pulsation has a biphasic waveform. The \u2018a \u2019wave corresponds to the right atrial contraction and ends synchronously with the carotid artery pulse. The peak of the \u2018a \u2019wave demarcates the end of the atrial systole The \u2018x\u2019 descent follows the \u2018a\u2019 wave and corresponds to atrial relaxation and Rapid atrial filing due to low pressure. The \u2018c\u2019 wave corresponds to the right ventricular contraction causing the tricuspid valve to bulge towards the right Atrium during RV isovolumetric contraction. The \u2018v\u2019 wave corresponds to Venous filing when the tricuspid valve is closed and the venous pressure increases from venous Return this occurs during the following the carotid pulse.

It causes babies to need extra oxygen and help with breathing Cause of Respiratory Distress syndrome in preterm baby RDS occurs when there is not enough surfactant in the lungs. Surfactant is a liquid made by the lungs that keeps the airways (alveoli) open. This liquid makes it possible for babies to breathe in air after delivery. An unborn baby starts to make surfactant at about 26 weeks of pregnancy. If a baby is premature (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy), he or she may not have made enough surfactant yet Pulmonary surfactant composition dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of phospholipids (PL) and proteins (SP) It is made up of about 70% to 80% PL, mainly (DPPC), 10% SP-A, B, C and D, and 10% neutral lipids, mainly cholesterol</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option A.
