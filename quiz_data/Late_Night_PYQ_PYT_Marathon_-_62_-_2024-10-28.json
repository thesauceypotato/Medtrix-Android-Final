It is a special region of premotor cortex situated in inferior frontal gyrus. Area 44 is situated in pars triangularis and 45 in pars opercularis of this gyrus. Broca aphasia is the non-fluent speech problem. It occurs due to lesion in left frontal lobe of cerebral cortex. It is also known as expressive aphasia or anterior aphasia. The affected persons do not complete the sentences because of their inability to construct the sentences. They often talk in short phrases by omitting small words such as \u2018and\u2019, \u2018is\u2019, \u2018for\u2019, etc. They make great efforts even to initiate speech.
