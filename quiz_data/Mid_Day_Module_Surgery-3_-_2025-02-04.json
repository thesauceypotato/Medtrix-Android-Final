Obesity and diabetes mellitus are additional independent risk factors Imaging is a critical part of the preoperative assessment of HCC and accurate tumour staging and anatomical assessment is essential to determine technical and oncological resectability and exclude metastatic disease. Triple-phase CT chest/ abdomen/pelvis and MRI of the liver is the standard of care, The early arterial phase following intravenous contrast detects small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) owing to their predominantly arterial blood supply. The venous phase demonstrates branches of the intrahepatic portal vein and the hepatic veins.

Diarrhea is another common symptom, caused by the large volume of gastric acid secretion. Abdominal pain from either peptic ulcer disease or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease remains the most common symptom, occurring in more than 75% of patients.

In the small bowel, the cysts hatch and a large number of trophozoites are released and carried to the colon, where flask-shaped ulcers form in the submucosa. The trophozoites multiply, ultimately forming cysts, which either enter the portal circulation or are passed in the faeces as an infective form that infects other humans as a result of insanitary conditions. Having entered the portal circulation, the trophozoites are filtered and trapped in the interlobular veins of the liver. They multiply in the portal triads, causing focal infarction of hepatocytes and liquefactive necrosis as a result of proteolytic enzymes produced by the trophozoites. The areas of necrosis eventually coalesce to form the abscess cavity. The typical patient with an amoebic liver abscess is a young adult male with a history of insidious onset of non-specific symptoms, such as abdominal pain, anorexia, fever, night sweats, malaise, cough and weight loss. These symptoms gradually progress to more specific symptoms of pain in the right upper abdomen and right shoulder tip, hiccoughs and a non-productive cough. A past history of bloody diarrhoea or travel to an endemic area raises the index of suspicion. The abscess cavity contains chocolate colored, odorless, \u2018anchovy sauce\u2019-like fluid that is a mixture of necrotic liver tissue and blood. On ultrasonography, an abscess cavity in the liver is seen as a hypoechoic or anechoic lesion with ill-defined borders; internal echoes suggest necrotic material or debris. The investigation is very accurate and is used for aspiration, both diagnostic and therapeutic. When there is doubt about the diagnosis, a computed tomography (CT) scan may be helpful. Diagnostic aspiration is of limited value except for establishing the typical colour of the aspirate, which is sterile and odorless unless it is secondarily infected Medical treatment is very effective and should be the first choice in the elective situation, with surgery being reserved for complications.</li><li>\u27a4 The organism enters the gut through food or water contaminated with the cyst.
