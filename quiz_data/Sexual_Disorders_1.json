Gender nonconformity describes a behavior or gender expression that does not match the norms of an individual's assigned gender but is not associated with distress or social/functional impairment . the gender incongruence in this adolescent has caused significant distress and interfered with school and social function, which is not consistent with the diagnosis of gender nonconformity. Option: B . Sexual aversion is defined as a sexual dysfunction disorder characterized by an extreme unwillingness and avoidance of sexual contact , which leads to significant distress and/or interpersonal conflicts. Option: C. The DSM-5 defines body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) as a psychiatric disorder characterized by persistent preoccupation with a perceived flaw in one's physical appearance that is mild or not observable by others . However, incongruence between a person's experienced/expressed gender and their biological sex, as seen here, is not considered BDD.</p>\n<p></p>",
