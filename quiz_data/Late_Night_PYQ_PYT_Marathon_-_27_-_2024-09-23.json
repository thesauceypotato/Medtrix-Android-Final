      "explanation": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 In cases of freshwater drowning, several key physiological changes occur due to the rapid absorption of large volumes of hypotonic water. The excessive absorption of water leads to hemodilution, which results in a significant decrease in plasma sodium levels, causing hyponatremia. The electrolyte imbalance, particularly hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, can provoke cardiac arrhythmias. Hyperkalemia occurs due to the release of intracellular potassium from swollen red blood cells that rupture in the hypotonic environment. These electrolyte disturbances, specifically hemodilution, hyponatremia, arrhythmias, and hyperkalemia, are characteristic findings in freshwater drowning and contribute significantly to the clinical complications observed in these cases.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 A. Hypernatremia and hypokalemia: This combination is not typical of freshwater drowning. Hypernatremia suggests saltwater drowning due to dehydration effects from hypertonic water, which contrasts with the hemodilution seen in freshwater incidents.</li><li>\u2022 A. Hypernatremia and hypokalemia:</li><li>\u2022 C.

Metabolic alkalosis and bradycardia:</li><li>\u2022 D.
