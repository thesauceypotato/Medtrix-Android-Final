      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Neutrophils Acute inflammation : mediator is Neutrophils (except in typhoid which are lymphocytes) . Chronic inflammation : mediators are lymphocytes , macrophages , and plasma cells (except in chronic pseudomonas which is neutrophils) .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) Neutrophil extracellular traps are extracellular fibrillar networks that concentrate antimicrobial substances at sites of infection and trap microbes, helping to prevent their spread. They are produced by neutrophils in response to infectious pathogens ( mainly bacteria and fungi ) and inflammatory mediators (e.g., chemokines, cytokines [mainly interferons], complement proteins, and ROS ). The extracellular traps consist of a viscous meshwork of nuclear chromatin that binds and concentrates granule proteins such as antimicrobial peptides and enzymes. In this process, the nuclei of the neutrophils are lost, leading to the death of the cells .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Eosinophils. Seen in helminthic infections and allergic reactions . Option: C. Lymphocytes. Seen in viral infections and chronic inflammation. Option: D. Macrophage. Seen in Chronic inflammation and some hypersensitivity reactions .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The nuclear chromatin in the NETs , which includes histones and associated DNA, has been postulated to be a source of nuclear antigens in systemic autoimmune diseases , particularly lupus , in which individuals react against their own DNA and nucleoproteins. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS). (A) Healthy neutrophils with nuclei stained red and cytoplasm stained green. (B) Release of nuclear material from neutrophils (note that two have lost their nuclei), forming extracellular traps. (C) Electron micrograph of bacteria (staphylococci) trapped in NETS.
