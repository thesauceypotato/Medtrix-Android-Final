      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>For abdominal trauma the best diagnostic modality is diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL). Much as a spiral CT scan is the best diagnostic modality, it cannot be used in an unstable patient. Similarly for abdominal injuries, DPL is not the best method to make a diagnosis, as a negative result has no significance and has morbidity; moreover, DPL is considered when the patient is stable when the ideal investigation should be a CT scan.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage : Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is a test rarely used in modern-day practice but can be of value in resource-limited settings. It is a test used to assess the presence of blood or contaminants in the abdomen. Procedure : A nasogastric tube is placed to empty the stomach and a urinary catheter is inserted to drain the bladder. A cannula is inserted below the umbilicus, directed caudally and posteriorly. The cannula is aspirated for blood (>10 mL is deemed as positive) and, following this, 500 mL of warmed Ringer\u2019s lactate solution is allowed to run into the abdomen from a 1-litre bag. The bag, with 500 mL remaining, is placed on the floor and the intra-abdominal fluid is allowed to flow under the influence of gravity \u2013 this aids drainage. Interpretations The presence of frank blood or similar contents to a nasogastric tube or urinary catheter denotes a positive DPL. If time allows and laboratory diagnosis is available, the presence of >100 000 red cells/\u00b5L or >500 white cells/\u00b5L is deemed positive (this is equivalent to 20 mL of free blood in the abdominal cavity), as is a raised amylase level. In the absence of laboratory facilities, a urine dipstick may be useful. Drainage of lavage fluid via a chest drain indicates penetration of the diaphragm .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. As trauma is always unpredictable and does not respect anatomical regions, injury to a junctional zone presents huge challenges requiring teamwork from different specialists. The key junctional zones are between the neck and thorax, between the thorax and abdomen and between the abdomen and pelvis (including the groin). Option: B. Injuries affecting the lower neck usually extend down to the mediastinum. The latter with its major vessels and heart is a very high-risk area. Option: C. Retroperitoneal injury is often difficult to diagnose because it is associated with other intra-abdominal injuries. For management purposes, it is divided into the following three zones: zone 1 \u2013 central involving major vessels requiring exploration; zone 2 \u2013 lateral involving kidneys usually managed conservatively; and zone 3 \u2013 pelvis\u2013haematomas, which are best left undisturbed. The junctional zones therefore can be summarized as the neck, mediastinum, diaphragm, groin and retroperitoneum.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All of the above Statement A is true : In abdominal injuries, after resuscitation, triaging them into the following groups helps in their management: Haemodynamically normal patients whose treatment can await the completion of investigations. Haemodynamically \u2018stable\u2019 patients in whom investigations are urgent and are needed to decide whether management will be nonsurgical or surgical. Haemodynamically \u2018unstable\u2019 patients who need to be taken to theatre immediately to arrest bleeding. Statement B is true : The \u2018gold standard\u2019 in torso trauma is CECT, provided the patient is stable and belongs to the second category as detailed previously. Intravenous contrast is used. In suspected duodenal injury, oral contrast is used, and in suspected rectal injury, rectal contrast is used. Statement C is true : FAST is a useful and readily available investigation ideal for diagnosing blood or fluid in the abdomen and pericardium. The great advantage is that it is portable and can be done while resuscitation is being carried out; the disadvantage is that it is highly operator dependent.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Computed tomography scan CT has become the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for the intra-abdominal diagnosis of injury in stable patients. The scan can be performed using intravenous contrast. CT is sensitive to blood and individual organ injury as well as to retroperitoneal injury. An entirely normal abdominal CT is usually sufficient to exclude intraperitoneal injury. The following points are important when performing CT: It remains an inappropriate investigation for physiologically compromised patients If the duodenal injury is suspected from the mechanism of injury, oral contrast may be helpful If the rectal and distal colonic injury is suspected in the absence of blood on rectal examination, the air around the colon may indicate injury; in all cases, clinical suspicion supersedes investigation results. Focused Assessment With Sonography in Trauma and extended FAST (FAST and eFAST) Focused Assessment With Sonography in Trauma (FAST) is a technique whereby ultrasound (sonography) imaging is used to assess the torso for the presence of free fluid in the abdominal cavity and is extended into the thoracic cavities and pericardium (eFAST). There should be no attempt to determine the nature or extent of the specific injury. eFAST is usually a rapid, reproducible, portable and non-invasive bedside test and can be performed at the same time as resuscitation. eFAST is accurate at detecting >100 mL of free blood ; however, it is very operator dependent and, especially if the patient is very obese or the bowel is full of gas, it may be unreliable. Hollow viscus injury and solid organ injury are difficult to diagnose , even in experienced hands, as small amounts of gas or fluid are difficult to assess and eFAST has a low sensitivity (29\u201335%) for organ injury without hemoperitoneum . eFAST is also unreliable for excluding injury in penetrating trauma . If there is doubt, the eFAST examination can be repeated.</p>\n<p></p>",

This is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with multiple injuries. Quite often it is not recognised. All the clinical features result from raised intra-abdominal pressure, which compresses the individual organs, thereby causing deterioration of their individual functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The triad of oliguria, elevated peak airway pressures, and elevated intra-abdominal pressure is known as abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) (Oliguria is a cardinal sign.) Diagnosis: While the diagnosis of ACS is a clinical one, measuring IAP is useful to confirm the diagnosis. Ideally, a catheter inserted into the peritoneal cavity could measure IAP to substantiate the diagnosis. In practice, transurethral bladder pressure measurement reflects IAP and is most often used to confirm the presence of ACS. IAH: Intra-abdominal hypertension is defined as an IAP \u226512 mmHg recorded on three standard measurements conducted 4 to 6 hours apart and is separated into several grades. The diagnosis of ACS is the presence of an IAP \u226520 mmHg recorded by three measurements 1 to 6 hours apart, along with the new onset of organ dysfunction. Bladder pressure measurements in the assessment of intra-abdominal hypertension or abdominal compartment syndrome: RECORDED PRESSURE (mmHg) GRADE OF IAH OR ACS 5-7 Normal I n the absence of organ dysfunction: 12-15 Grade I IAH 16-20 Grade II IAH 21-25 Grade III IAH >25 Grade IV IAH In the presence of new onset organ dysfunction: >20 ACS Effects of raised IAH : Effect of raised intra-abdominal pressure on individual organ function . System Effect Renal Increase in renal vascular resistance leading to a reduction in glomerular filtration rate and impaired renal function Cardiovascular Decrease in venous return resulting in decreased cardiac output because of both a reduction in preload and an increase in afterload Respiratory Increased ventilation pressures because of splinting of the diaphragm, decreased lung compliance and increased airway pressures Visceral effects Reduction in visceral perfusion Intracranial effects Severe rises in intracranial pressures Treatment: Primary ACS is due to a disease process within the abdomen that is best treated with decompressive laparotomy and correction of the inciting disease process . Abdominal closure may not be possible without causing recurrent ACS which should prompt the use of temporary abdominal closure manoeuvres. Secondary ACS is a condition that arises from a condition not located in the abdomen or pelvis . Initial management of secondary ACS without evidence of end-organ damage should be treated medically. Medical Managemen t: Correcting a positive fluid balance Evacuating intraluminal contents via a nasogastric tube Foley and enemas Relaxing the abdominal wall with adequate sedation and pain control Drainage of peritoneal fluid.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B.

The most common cause of acute pancreatitis in a child is blunt trauma to the abdomen from a cycle handlebar injury. Option: D. The vast majority of renal injuries are treated conservatively. Every time the patient passes urine, some of it is saved in a transparent jar and the time of passing urine is noted. This gives the idea that the haematuria is getting better. In selected cases, if the haematuria does not improve while the patient is still stable, there is a place for a selective renal angiogram with a view to renal artery embolisation.

After instituting the ATLS resuscitation policy, an emergency intravenous uro-gram (IVU) is carried out. This is mainly done to ensure that the other kidney is normal. A renal ultrasound is done to gauge the size of the perirenal haematoma and repeated if necessary, in a few days\u2019 time to make sure that it is reducing in size. Some may do a CECT scan. But as the same information can be obtained from a US scan, unnecessary radiation is avoided particularly because the patient is 9 years old. Haematuria following minor trauma should alert the surgeon to the possibility of injury to a pathological kidney, such as congenital hydronephrosis or horseshoe kidney.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Renal Trauma: Kidneys are retroperitoneal structures; they are relatively fixed by their vascular pedicles and are well protected by perinephric fat, strong posterior abdominal wall muscles and the lower rib cage. Renal trauma is usually a part of polytrauma and is present in only 5% of all trauma cases. Mechanism Of Injury: Trauma may be penetrating or blunt, the latter being far more common Common Modes: Head-on collisions in road traffic accidents Falls from height Contact sports Sudden rapid deceleration (Avulsion Injury to ureter at PUJ) Penetrating injuries cause direct tissue disruption and are usually associated with adjacent organ injuries Presentation: Loss of Consciousness Haemodynamic Shock Haematuria (Pathognomic) Abdominal Pain with flank contusions Diagnosis: CECT of the abdomen is necessary to delineate the type and extent of renal injury. It provides information about the presence of parenchymal laceration, its depth, extension into the pelvicalyceal system and the extent of urinary extravasation It also provides valuable information about other abdominal injuries and the status of the contralateral kidney. Common indications for CECT in abdominal trauma include: Abdominal trauma with gross haematuria Microscopic haematuria with hypotension (systolic <90 mmHg) Rapid deceleration injury Children with microscopic haematuria (>5 red blood cells [RBCs]) All penetrating injuries. Indications for emergency surgical exploration are: expanding or pulsatile retroperitoneal haematoma PUJ avulsion renal pedicle injury haemodynamic instability Treatment: Conservative management with close surveillance is sufficient in the majority of cases of isolated renal trauma. Lower-grade injuries, sometimes including grade IV, can be managed conservatively with bed rest, antibiotics in case of penetrating injuries and serial haemoglobin estimation. Reimaging is usually done after 2\u20134 days in cases of falling haemoglobin levels, fever or expanding fank mass.

Blunt injury produces contusion, laceration and avulsion, often associated with splenic, mesenteric or renal injuries. (Common & has high Mortality) Penetrating injuries , including stab and gunshot wounds , are often associated with chest or pericardial involvement. Complications: Intrahepatic haematoma Liver abscess Bile collection Biliary fistula Haemobilia Ascites Biliary strictures Intra-abdominal collections Hepatic artery aneurysm Arteriovenous fistula Arterio Biliary fistula Liver failure Diagnosis : The liver is an extremely well-vascularised organ and blood loss is the major early complication following injury A high index of suspicion is essential with any chest or upper abdominal stab wound, especially where significant blood loss is obvious . Severe crushing injuries to the lower chest or upper abdomen frequently result in rib fractures, haemothorax and splenic and/or liver injury. Penetrating injuries are frequently associated with massive, continued blood loss and coagulopathies ; transfer to the operating theatre should occur while blood products are obtained and resuscitation continues. Focused assessment sonography in trauma (FAST) performed by an experienced operator will identify free intraperitoneal fluid. In haemodynamically unstable patients with penetrating wounds, a laparotomy and/or thoracotomy is indicated once active resuscitation has commenced In haemodynamically stable patients , an urgent contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest and abdomen is performed to look for parenchymal injury and concomitant damage to other thoracic or abdominal organs The operative management of liver injuries can be summarized as \"the Four Ps\" . Push : At laparotomy, the liver is reconstructed and bleeding is controlled by direct bimanual compression. Pringle : Inflow from the portal triad is controlled by a pringle manoeuvre, with direct compression of the portal triad, either digitally or using the soft clamp.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pancreatic injury This 10-year-old girl has the classical manifestation of a traumatic pseudocyst of the pancreas . The most common cause of acute pancreatitis in a child is blunt trauma to the abdomen from a cycle handlebar injury. This girl sustained such an injury 10 days ago. At the time she suffered from traumatic acute pancreatitis, which obviously was not clinically bad enough to seek hospital help. Over the ensuing 10 days, she developed a mass in the epigastrium typical of a pseudocyst. This should be confirmed by an ultrasound scan, which would show a cyst behind the stomach. Depending upon the size and the patient\u2019s symptoms, it should be managed accordingly. A cyst larger than 6 cm will need to be drained. A cysto-gastrostomy is performed by the endoscopic route.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The pancreas is not frequently damaged in blunt abdominal trauma but when it occurs it is often associated with injuries to other viscera, especially the liver, the spleen and the duodenum. Occasionally, a forceful blow to the epigastrium (such as from the steering wheel in a car accident) may crush the body of the pancreas against the vertebral column. Penetrating trauma to the upper abdomen or the back carries a higher chance of pancreatic injury Presentation: Epigastric Pain Rise in serum Amylase Diagnosis: Most pancreatic injury occurs as a result of blunt trauma. The major problem is that of diagnosis because the pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ . CT remains the mainstay of accurate diagnosis. ERCP and MRCP Amylase or lipase estimation is insensitive. In penetrating trauma, an injury may only be detected during laparotomy. Treatment: The most important factor that determines the treatment is whether the pancreatic duct has been disrupted. Classically the pancreas should be treated with conservative surgery and closed low-suction drainage. Injuries are treated according to the ISS system of the AAST . Injuries to the pancreatic body to the left of the superior mesenteric vessels and to the tail are treated by closed drainage alone, with distal pancreatectomy if the duct is involved. Proximal injuries (to the right of the superior mesenteric artery) are treated as conservatively as possible, although partial pancreatectomy may be necessary. A Whipple\u2019s procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) is rarely needed and should not be performed in an emergency situation because of the very high associated mortality rate. A damage control procedure with packing and drainage should be performed and the patient referred for definitive surgery once stabilised.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Patients who have undergone major surgery following trauma are prone to complication of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Option: B. Liver is damaged typically as a result of blunt trauma. This patient is resuscitated according to the ATLS protocol. Option: D. The vast majority of renal injuries are treated conservatively. Every time the patient passes urine, some of it is saved in a transparent jar and the time of passing urine is noted. This gives the idea that the haematuria is getting better. In selected cases, if the haematuria does not improve while the patient is still stable, there is a place for a selective renal angiogram with a view to renal artery embolisation. Haematuria following minor trauma should alert the surgeon to the possibility of injury to a pathological kidney, such as congenital hydronephrosis or horseshoe kidney.</p>\n<p></p>",
