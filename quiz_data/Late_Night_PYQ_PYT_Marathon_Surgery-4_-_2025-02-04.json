A) Achalasia cardia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Achalasia cardia, commonly referred to as achalasia, is a medical condition that affects the esophagus, specifically the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the muscles of the esophageal wall. This condition is characterized by the following features:</li><li>\u27a4 Failure of LES Relaxation: In achalasia, the LES, a muscular ring that separates the esophagus from the stomach, does not relax properly during swallowing. Normally, the LES should relax to allow food and liquids to pass into the stomach, but in achalasia, this relaxation is impaired. Incomplete Emptying of the Esophagus: Due to the dysfunctional LES, the esophagus is unable to empty food and liquids into the stomach efficiently. This leads to a gradual buildup of food and fluids in the esophagus, causing symptoms. Difficulty in Swallowing: The most prominent symptom of achalasia is dysphagia, which is difficulty in swallowing. Patients often experience a sensation of food getting stuck in the chest while eating and may need to drink fluids or change their body position to help food pass into the stomach. Regurgitation: As a result of the esophageal emptying problems, patients with achalasia may also experience regurgitation of undigested food, often occurring at night when lying down. Chest Pain: Some individuals with achalasia may experience chest pain or discomfort, often due to the accumulation of food and fluids in the esophagus.</li><li>\u27a4 Failure of LES Relaxation: In achalasia, the LES, a muscular ring that separates the esophagus from the stomach, does not relax properly during swallowing.

Pseudoaneurysms can also occur in other arteries, such as the brachial, radial, ulnar, and carotid arteries. Common causes of pseudoaneurysm formation include trauma, iatrogenic injury during medical procedures (e.g., arterial catheterization), and underlying arterial disease (e.g., atherosclerosis). The clinical presentation of a pseudoaneurysm may include a pulsatile mass, pain, tenderness, and signs of bleeding or hematoma formation. The diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm is confirmed by imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scan, or angiography. Treatment options for a pseudoaneurysm may include observation, compression, percutaneous thrombin injection, or surgical repair depending on the size, location, and underlying cause of the lesion.

It is important to rotate the needle through the tissue to prevent unnecessary enlargement of the needle hole. The distance between the entry point of the suture and the edge of the wound should be nearly equal to the depth of tissue that is being sutured. Additionally, it is advised to leave a distance that is twice this measurement between two consecutive sutures.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
