The cranial neuropore normally closes by the 25th day of gestation (around the 4th week), while the caudal neuropore closes by the 28th day (also around the 4th week). Anencephaly: When the cranial neuropore fails to close, the result is anencephaly.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. A. Foramen lacerum</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The foramen lacerum is a triangular-shaped foramen located in the skull base. It is largely filled with cartilage in a living individual and serves as a landmark rather than a conduit for significant neurovascular structures (though some smaller emissary veins and nerves might pass through). Importantly, the internal carotid artery courses superiorly to this foramen but doesn't pass through it. The foramen lacerum is bordered by three bones:</li><li>\u2022 Petrous part of the temporal bone: This bone forms the posterior and medial aspect of the foramen lacerum. Sphenoid bone: The greater wing of the sphenoid bone forms the anterior and lateral aspect of the foramen lacerum. Basilar part of the occipital bone: The basilar part of the occipital bone forms the posterior and medial aspect of the foramen lacerum.</li><li>\u2022 Petrous part of the temporal bone: This bone forms the posterior and medial aspect of the foramen lacerum.</li><li>\u2022 Petrous part of the temporal bone:</li><li>\u2022 Sphenoid bone: The greater wing of the sphenoid bone forms the anterior and lateral aspect of the foramen lacerum.</li><li>\u2022 Sphenoid bone:</li><li>\u2022 greater wing</li><li>\u2022 Basilar part of the occipital bone: The basilar part of the occipital bone forms the posterior and medial aspect of the foramen lacerum.</li><li>\u2022 Basilar part of the occipital bone:</li><li>\u2022 The foramen lacerum is covered by a fibrous membrane, which makes it difficult to see and access.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Foramen magnum: The foramen magnum is the largest foramen of the skull and is located in its base. Through it pass the medulla oblongata (which becomes the spinal cord as it exits the skull), the vertebral arteries, spinal parts of the accessory nerves, and the anterior and posterior spinal arteries. It is formed entirely by the occipital bone.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Foramen magnum:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Foramen rotundum: The foramen rotundum is located in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. Through this foramen, the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve (V2) exits the cranial cavity to enter the pterygopalatine fossa. It is formed solely by the sphenoid bone.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Foramen rotundum:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Foramen jugulare (jugular foramen): The jugular foramen is a large irregular opening located between the petrous part of the temporal bone and the occipital bone. This foramen transmits the internal jugular vein and several cranial nerves: the glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X), and accessory (XI) nerves. It is formed by two bones:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Foramen jugulare (jugular foramen):</li><li>\u2022 Anterolaterally: the petrous part of the temporal bone.

Understanding its anatomical context and relations is crucial for interpreting imaging and planning surgeries involving the cranial base.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Yet, due to diaphragmatic paralysis in phrenic nerve palsy cases, the affected side of the diaphragm moves upward (paradoxical breathing). The gold standard test to find this is to stimulate the phrenic nerve electrically or magnetically while simultaneously recording the transdiaphragmatic pressure and/or the compound muscle action potential. Both fluoroscopy and ultrasonography can show this.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

The gluteus medius muscle is critical for stabilizing the pelvis during gait. When functioning normally, it prevents the pelvis from dropping to the opposite side during the swing phase of the walk. If injured or dysfunctional, such as might occur from a traumatic fall, the ability to maintain pelvic stability is compromised, leading to a lurching gait, known clinically as a Trendelenburg gait.</li><li>\u2022 The structure shown in the image are :</li><li>\u2022 The structure shown in the image are :</li><li>\u2022 1-Gluteus maximus</li><li>\u2022 2-Gluteus medius</li><li>\u2022 3-Piriformis</li><li>\u2022 4-Sciatic nerve</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 1.

Piriformis : A small muscle located deep in the buttock, behind the gluteus maximus. It helps with lateral rotation of the hip. Although it is near the sciatic nerve, it is less likely involved in producing a lurching gait unless it compresses the sciatic nerve, causing sciatica.</li><li>\u2022 3. Piriformis</li><li>\u2022 4. Sciatic Nerve : The largest nerve in the body, running from the lower back to the feet. While injury to this nerve can cause pain and weakness in the legs, it typically would not cause a lurching gait unless there is significant associated muscle weakness.</li><li>\u2022 4.

This is often demonstrated by a positive Trendelenburg sign and manifests as a compensatory lurch toward the affected side to maintain balance.</li><li>\u27a4 Additional Information</li><li>\u27a4 Additional Information</li><li>\u27a4 Gluteus medius and minimus are powerful abductors of the hip joint. Mechanism of actions of gluteus medius and minimus-</li><li>\u27a4 When the leg on one side is lifted off the ground, the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, on the opposite supported side, exert traction on the hip bone by acting from the femur. This action results in a slight raising of the pelvis on the unsupported side, which helps maintain the trunk in the upright position. The actions of these muscles are affected when there is an injury to the superior gluteal nerve, neck of the femur, or loss of normal angulation of the shaft of the femur. This occurs in conditions like paralysis of the glutei, developmental dysplasia of the hip, etc. When the gluteus medius and minimus are paralyzed, the pelvis sinks down on the unsupported (normal) side, when the patient tries to stand on the affected limb.
