Terbinafine is a commonly used drug for the treatment of dermatophytosis. Class : Allylamines and may be used topically or orally. MOA: Terbinafine inhibits lanosterol synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme squalene epoxidase. This drug tends to accumulate in the skin and its appendages, and its side effects are mild by the topical route.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Important antifungals mechanism of action: Class of drug Mechanism of action Examples Allyl amines Inhibits lanosterol synthesis by inhibiting squalene epoxidase Terbinafine Antimetabolite Inhibits nucleic acid synthesis Flucytosine Azoles Inhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting 14-alpha-demethylase Ketoconazole Polyenes Disrupts cell membrane integrity Amphotericin B Griseofulvin Act on mitotic spindle</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A.
