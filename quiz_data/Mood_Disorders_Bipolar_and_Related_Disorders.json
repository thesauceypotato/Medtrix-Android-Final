Valproate can cause neural tube defects (NTDs), however, the incidence of NTDs on valproate is much lesser than the incidence of Ebstein's anomaly on lithium. Lithium can cause Ebstein's anomaly, but the incidence of the same is lesser than that of NTDs on valproate. Antipsychotics are preferred over both lithium and valproate due to less teratogenicity.
