This reaction occurs when a ligand binds to a receptor (either G-protein coupled or tyrosine kinase receptor) that activates PLC. Subsequently, IP3 diffuses to the endoplasmic reticulum where it triggers calcium release, while DAG remains in the membrane to activate protein kinase C.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option a. Adenylyl cyclase : This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), not IP3 and DAG.

Guanylyl cyclase : This enzyme catalyzes the formation of cyclic GMP (cGMP) from GTP. It exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the latter activated by nitric oxide. It does not produce IP3 or DAG. Option d. Phospholipase A : This enzyme cleaves fatty acids from the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids, generating arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids. It's involved in the production of eicosanoids but not IP3 or DAG.</li><li>\u2022 Option a. Adenylyl cyclase : This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), not IP3 and DAG.

Allocation of organs must take into account the relative size of the donor and recipient for most organ types. While kidney transplants can be performed between adults and children without significant size concerns, the heart, lung, liver, and small bowel require more careful size matching. The pancreas doesn't appear in discussions of organs requiring strict size compatibility.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Heart - Incorrect. Size compatibility is critically important for heart transplantation. A heart that is too large won't fit in the recipient's chest cavity, while one that's too small may not provide adequate cardiac output for the recipient's body size. Precise size matching is essential for proper cardiac function.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Heart</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Liver - Incorrect. Size matching is crucial for liver transplantation. An adult donor liver cannot be transplanted into a child because of the size mismatch. This has led to the development of split-liver transplantation, where the liver is divided so the left lobe or left lateral segments can be used for a child and the right lobe for an adult recipient.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Liver</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Lung - Incorrect. Lung transplantation requires careful size matching to ensure proper fit within the chest cavity. Lungs that are too large cannot physically fit in the recipient's thoracic space, while lungs that are too small may not provide adequate respiratory function for the recipient.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Lung</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 While size matching is critical for heart, lung, liver, and small bowel transplantation, it is comparatively less critical for pancreatic transplantation among the given options.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

D) Visual acuity & Amblyopia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The cover-uncover test is a clinical examination technique used to detect and assess strabismus (ocular misalignment). It is particularly useful for both manifest squint (tropia) and latent squint (phoria), as well as latent nystagmus. However, it has no role in assessing visual acuity or diagnosing amblyopia.</li><li>\u2022 In the cover-uncover test, when examining a patient with tropia (manifest squint), first a cover test is performed where the normal eye is covered to observe if the squinting eye takes up fixation. Then, in the cover-uncover test, the cover is removed to observe the movement of the previously covered eye (secondary deviation).</li><li>\u2022 For phoria (latent squint), the cover-uncover test is used to break fusion and reveal the hidden misalignment. When one eye is covered, fusion is disrupted, and upon uncovering, the eye movement can be observed as the eyes attempt to regain fusion.</li><li>\u2022 In latent nystagmus, covering one eye can induce or intensify nystagmus, which can be observed when the cover is removed.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Latent nystagmus : Incorrect. The cover-uncover test is useful for diagnosing latent nystagmus. When one eye is covered in patients with latent nystagmus, the uncovered eye may exhibit nystagmus (eye dancing movement) that was not visible when both eyes were open. The test helps reveal this hidden nystagmus.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Latent nystagmus</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Latent squint : Incorrect. The cover-uncover test is specifically designed to detect latent squint (phoria). In phoria, both eyes appear straight when open, but when fusion is disrupted by covering one eye, the hidden misalignment is revealed. Upon uncovering, the eye movement that occurs to regain fusion can be observed.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Latent squint</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Manifest squint : Incorrect. For manifest squint (tropia), the cover test is initially performed by covering the normal eye to observe if the squinting eye takes up fixation. Then, the cover-uncover test is used to assess the secondary deviation as the cover is removed from the normal eye. This helps differentiate between different types of tropias.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is determined by the equation GFR = Kf \u00d7 NFP , where NFP represents net filtration pressure.
