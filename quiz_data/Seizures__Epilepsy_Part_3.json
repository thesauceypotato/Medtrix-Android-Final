Commonest presentation of Neurocysticercosis is Seizures. These seizures may be generalized, focal, or Jacksonian. Seizures are associated with inflammation surrounding cysticerci in the brain parenchyma. There is a wide variety of Neurocysticercosis depending on the intensity of the infestation, the localization of cysticerci, and the degree of inflammatory reaction . Cysticercosis is an infection with the larval stage (cysticercosis cellulose) of solium(Pig tapeworm) The lesion of Neurocysticercosis is readily visualized by MRI or CT scan. Parenchymal brain calcification is the most common finding on (Starry sky appearance) Brain parenchyma is the most common site of Neurocysticercosis. The ventricular system is the 2nd most common site of Most common sites of Neurocysticercosis- Parenchymatous >intraventricular> subarachnoid >spinal >orbital. These cysts are located in order of frequency in CNS(neurological manifestations are the most common) Subcutaneous tissue Striated muscle Globe of the eye Treatment Antiparasitic drugs- Albendazole Praziquantel Albendazole and praziquantel combination with more than two cystic lesions. with multiple subarachnoid cysticerci. may exacerbate the inflammatory response around the deadly parasite, thereby exacerbating seizures or hydrocephalus as well. Monitoring of the patient High Dose glucocorticoids should be used during treatment. Because glucocorticoids induce first-pass metabolism of praziquantel and may decrease its antiparasitic effect, cimetidine should be co-administered to inhibit praziquantel metabolism. Hydrocephalus treatment- Removal of the cysticercus via neurosurgery via neuro-endoscopy Microdissection using an open craniotomy Ventriculoperitoneal shunting + prolonged courses of antiparasitic drugs Patient requiring prolonged therapy- Methotrexate Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors Steroid-sparing agents Diffuse cerebral edema/Elevated intracranial pressure due to multiple inflamed lesions- Glucocorticoids(a mainstay of therapy) Antiparasitic drugs should be avoided For ocular and spinal medullary lesions, drug-induced inflammation may cause irreversible damage.

Major neuroimaging criteria Cystic lesions without a discernible scolex, typical small enhancing lesions, multilobulated cystic lesions in the subarachnoid space, typical parenchymal brain calcifications b. Confirmative neuroimaging criteria Resolution of cystic lesions spontaneously or after suicidal drug therapy Migration of ventricular cysts documented on sequential neuroimaging studies c. Minor neuroimaging criteria Obstructive hydrocephalus or abnormal enhancement of basal leptomeninges 3. Clinical/exposure criteria a. Major clinical/exposure criteria Detection of specific anticysticercal antibodies (e.g., by enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot [EITB]) or cysticerci antigens by well- standardized immunodiagnostic tests Cysticercosis outside the central nervous system Evidence of a household contact with T. solium infection b. Minor clinical/exposure criteria Clinical manifestations suggestive of neurocysticercosis Individuals coming from or living in an area where cysticercosis is endemic Diagnosis is confirmed by one absolute criterion, by two major criteria or one major and one confirmatory neuroimaging criteria plus any clinical/exposure criterion, or by one major neuroimaging criterion plus two clinical/exposure criteria (including at least one major clinical/exposure criterion), together with the exclusion of other pathologies producing similar neuroimaging findings. A probable diagnosis is supported by one major neuroimaging criterion plus any two clinical/ exposure criteria or by one minor neuroimaging criterion plus at least one major clinical/exposure criterion.</p>\n<p></p>",
