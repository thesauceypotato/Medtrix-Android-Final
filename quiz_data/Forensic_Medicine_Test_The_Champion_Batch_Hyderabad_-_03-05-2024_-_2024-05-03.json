It comes to light during the trial that the professor has been battling untreated schizophrenia, characterized by profound auditory hallucinations and delusions. On the day in question, he was under the delusion that his colleague was a covert agent sent to harm him, leading to the assault. The defence argues that the professor's mental state at the time of the incident rendered him incapable of understanding his actions' nature or distinguishing right from wrong. Given these circumstances and applying the Legal Test of Insanity, how should the professor's criminal responsibility be assessed?",
