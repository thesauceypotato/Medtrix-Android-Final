      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Triglyceride An amphipathic lipid is a lipid molecule that has both hydrophilic (water-attracting) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) regions. This property allows them to align themselves to form various structures in water environments such as cell membranes. A Triglycerides: Triglycerides are a type of fat that is found in the blood. A triglyceride molecule is composed of a glycerol backbone and three fatty acid chains. All of these parts are hydrophobic, meaning they are not attracted to water. Hence, triglycerides are not considered amphipathic lipids because they do not have a hydrophilic portion.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Phospholipids: Phospholipids are the main component of cell membranes. They consist of a glycerol molecule, two fatty acids, and a phosphate group. The phosphate group is hydrophilic, while the fatty acid chains are hydrophobic, making phospholipids amphipathic. Option C. Glycolipids: Glycolipids are composed of a lipid linked to a carbohydrate. The carbohydrate portion of glycolipids is hydrophilic, while the lipid portion is hydrophobic. This makes glycolipids amphipathic. Option D. Sphingolipids: Sphingolipids are a complex class of lipids that are defined by their backbone of sphingoid bases. They often have a polar head group (often containing phosphate or carbohydrate), making them hydrophilic, and two nonpolar fatty acid tails, making them hydrophobic. Therefore, sphingolipids are also amphipathic.</p>\n<p></p>",

Higher chances of mutation as compared to the nuclear genome: True. mtDNA is more prone to mutations than nuclear DNA due to a lack of introns, less efficient DNA repair mechanisms, and its proximity to reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the electron transport chain. Option B. Single stranded circular DNA: False. Mitochondrial DNA in most animals, including humans, is double-stranded and circular. Option C. Mitochondrial codons are slightly different from nuclear DNA codons: True. The genetic code of mtDNA does indeed have some differences compared to the universal genetic code used in nuclear DNA. For example, in human mitochondria, UGA codes for tryptophan instead of serving as a stop codon, and AUA codes for methionine instead of isoleucine. Option D. Mitochondrial DNA encodes for all Electron Transport Chain (ETC) complex proteins: False. mtDNA does not encode all the proteins required for the ETC. In humans, the mitochondrial genome encodes 13 proteins, all of which are subunits of the enzyme complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. The rest of the proteins involved in the ETC are encoded by nuclear genes and are imported into the mitochondria after being synthesized in the cytosol. Option E. Has around 16,000 base pairs: True.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Proteins Assimilation refers to the processes by which the body digests and absorbs nutrients from food, converting them into usable forms. One measure of the energy used in these processes is the thermic effect of food (TEF) or dietary induced thermogenesis, which is the amount of energy expended above the resting metabolic rate due to the cost of processing food for storage and use. Option A. Proteins: Among the macronutrients, proteins have the highest TEF. This means that the body uses more energy to digest, absorb, and assimilate protein compared to fats and carbohydrates.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. MUFAs (Monounsaturated Fatty Acids) and c) PUFAs (Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids): These are types of fats. The TEF of fats is generally lower than that of proteins and carbohydrates. There isn't a significant difference in TEF between MUFAs and PUFAs that would make one notably higher than the other. Option D. Carbohydrates: Carbohydrates have a higher TEF than fats but lower than proteins. However, it's worth noting that the TEF can vary within the carbohydrate category depending on the complexity of the carbohydrate (simple sugars vs. complex starches).</p>\n<p></p>",
