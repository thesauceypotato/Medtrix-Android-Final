Normally, elastase release from alveolar macrophages and infiltrating neutrophils is balanced by the presence of serum and tissue protease inhibitors. Neutrophils elastase is inhibited by serum \u03b11antitrypsin and macrophage elastase is inhibited by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Neutrophil and macrophage elastases can also degrade each other\u2019s (but not their own) inhibitors, augmenting their destructive capacity when both proteases are present.
