Type II lepra reaction can occur even after completion of multidrug therapy and is mediated by immune complex deposition. A bacteriological index (BI) of 4+ indicates paucibacillary disease and is consistent with tuberculoid leprosy. Clofazimine, used in MDT, can cause reddish-black skin discoloration and is effective against lepra reaction.
