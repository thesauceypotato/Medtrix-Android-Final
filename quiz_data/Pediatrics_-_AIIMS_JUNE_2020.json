      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>IV Ceftriaxone Based on the symptoms, the diagnosis is acute epiglottitis. ACUTE EPIGLOTITIS: This is a potentially lethal condition characterized by an acute rapidly progressive and potentially fulminating course of high fever , sore throat, dyspnea , restlessness, and rapidly progressing respiratory obstruction. The degree of respiratory distress at presentation is variable. The initial lack of respiratory distress can deceive the unwary clinician; respiratory distress can also be the first manifestation. Often, the otherwise healthy child suddenly develops a sore throat and fever. Within a matter of hours, the patient appears toxic , swallowing is difficult, and breathing is labored. Drooling is usually present and the neck is hyperextended in an attempt to maintain the airway. The child may assume the tripod position, sitting upright and leaning forward with the chin up and mouth open while bracing on the arms. A brief period of air hunger with restlessness may be followed by rapidly increasing cyanosis and coma. Complete obstruction of the airway and death can ensue unless adequate treatment is provided. The barking cough typical of infectious croup is rare. Acute epiglottitis (often called supraglottitis), although less common than croup, typically presents with a greater degree of airway compromise. Patients typically present with acute onset (over several hours) of sore throat, marked dysphagia and high fever . Patients are often encountered leaning forward in a 'tripod' position, toxic appearing and drooling . Unlike croup, cough is frequently absent. Lateral neck X-ray reveals a characteristic thickening of the epiglottis (' thumbprint' sign) or other supraglottic structures. H. influenzae type B is the major etiologic organism. If epiglottitis is suspected, rapid airway management is essential and includes securing the airways with intubation by skilled personnel. Instrumentation of the throat with tongue depressors is not advised as this can precipitate a fatal laryngospasm. Management includes securing the airway and broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, e.g. co-amoxiclav, ceftriaxone or cefuroxime. The incidence of epiglottitis has declined since the use of vaccines against H. influenzae.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Epiglottitis is commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) bacteria , although it can also be caused by other bacteria. Management of epiglottitis involves securing the airway to prevent airway obstruction, as well as initiating antibiotic therapy to target the underlying bacterial infection. IV Ceftriaxone is the appropriate choice for antibiotic treatment in this scenario, as it provides broad-spectrum coverage against common pathogens causing epiglottitis, including Hib.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: Nebulized racemic epinephrine Nebulized racemic epinephrine is primarily used in the management of croup , a viral infection causing upper airway inflammation. Croup typically presents with a barking cough and inspiratory stridor, but it is distinct from epiglottitis. Option B: Anti-diphtheria toxin Administering anti-diphtheria toxin is not indicated in this scenario unless diphtheria infection is suspected. Diphtheria is a bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and it can present with symptoms similar to epiglottitis. Option C: Corticosteroids / conservative Corticosteroids may have a role in reducing airway edema in epiglottitis ; however, the immediate priority in this case is securing the airway and administering antibiotics. Airway management is crucial due to the risk of airway obstruction. Corticosteroids can be considered as an adjunctive therapy after airway management and antibiotic administration to further reduce airway inflammation.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>IV Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the cephalosporin class. It provides coverage against common pathogens causing epiglottitis, including Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) bacteria, which is the most common causative agent. Additionally, IV Ceftriaxone has activity against other bacteria commonly associated with respiratory tract infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and some Enterobacteriaceae.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA IV Ceftriaxone - Broad-spectrum antibiotic targeting common pathogens causing epiglottitis, including Haemophilus influenzae B - Acute bacterial epiglottitis - Systemic administration for rapid and effective distribution - Ludwig's angina - First-line therapy along with securing the airway - Peritonsillar abscess Nebulized racemic - Primarily used in croup, a viral infection causing upper airway inflammation - Viral croup epinephrine - Not indicated for bacterial epiglottitis Anti-diphtheria toxin - Not indicated unless diphtheria infection is suspected - Diphtheria infection - Epiglottitis is commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) bacteria, not Corynebacterium diphtheriae Corticosteroids - May have a role in reducing airway edema in epiglottitis - Severe airway edema in epiglottitis - Airway management and antibiotic administration are the immediate priorities</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>AM: PM variation > 15% LABORATORY FINDINGS Lung function tests can help to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and to determine disease severity. Pulmonary Function Testing: Forced expiratory airflow measures are helpful in diagnosing and monitoring asthma and in assessing efficacy of therapy. Lung function testing is particularly helpful in children with asthma who are poor perceivers of airflow obstruction or when physical signs of asthma do not occur until airflow obstruction is severe. Diurnal variation in Peak expiratory flow ( PEF) >20% is consistent with asthma Accordingly, in asthmatic patients, FEV 1 typically decreases during or after exercise by >15%. Bronchodilator response to an inhaled \u03b2-agonist (e.g., albuterol) is greater in asthmatic patients than non asthmatic persons; an improvement in FEV 1 \u226512% or >200 mL is consistent with asthma. In asthma, airways blockage results in reduced airflow with forced exhalation. Because asthmatic patients typically have hyperinflated lungs, FEV 1 can be simply adjusted for full expiratory lung volume\u2014the forced vital capacity (FVC)\u2014with an FEV 1 : FVC ratio. Generally, an FEV 1 :FVC ratio <0.80 indicates significant airflow obstruction Table:  Lung Function Abnormalities in Asthma Spirometry (in clinic) \u25cf Airflow limitation: \u25cf Low FEV 1 (relative to percentage of predicted norms) \u25cf FEV 1 : FVC ratio < 0. 80 Bronchodilator response (to inhaled \u03b2-agonist): \u25cf Improvement in FEV 1 \u2265 12% and \u2265 200 mL Exercise challenge: \u25cf Worsening in FEV 1 \u2265 15% Daily peak flow or FEV 1 monitoring: day to day and/or A.M \u2013 to \u2013 P.M. variation \u2265 20% \u25cf Main criteria consistent with asthma.

Inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and reversible airflow obstruction contribute to asthma symptoms. Genetic predisposition and environmental factors (allergens, infections, tobacco smoke, air pollution) increase asthma risk. Recurrent wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, often worse at night or with triggers. History, physical examination, spirometry, and peak flow monitoring help assess symptoms and lung function.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A. Increase in FEV1> 12% after bronchodilator: This is a characteristic feature of asthma. It indicates bronchial reversibility after the administration of a bronchodilator, which is commonly observed in individuals with asthma. OPTION C. FEV1 decrease more than 15% after exercise: Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is a common manifestation of asthma. A significant decrease in FEV1 after exercise supports the diagnosis of asthma. OPTION D. FEV1 / FVC < 80%: This refers to a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio, which indicates airflow limitation. A value below 80% suggests airway obstruction, which is a hallmark feature of asthma.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Different subtypes of asthma exist based on clinical features and characteristics.

Patients with a supracristal VSD of any size are usually referred for surgery because of the high risk for aortic valve regurgitation. Severe pulmonary vascular disease unresponsive to pulmonary vasodilators is a contraindication to closure of a VSD.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The correction of a ventricular septal defect (VSD ) is primarily done to avoid or correct the following conditions: Heart Failure: Untreated VSDs can lead to an increased workload on the heart, which can eventually result in heart failure. Correcting the VSD helps to prevent or alleviate heart failure symptoms. Pulmonary Hypertension: VSDs can cause increased blood flow and pressure in the lungs, leading to pulmonary hypertension. Surgical or interventional closure of the VSD can reduce the strain on the pulmonary blood vessels. Eisenmenger Syndrome: In some cases, if a VSD is left uncorrected, it can lead to a reversal of blood flow within the heart, known as Eisenmenger syndrome. This condition causes oxygen-poor blood from the right side of the heart to mix with oxygen-rich blood from the left side, leading to cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin) and other complications. Correcting the VSD can prevent or delay the development of Eisenmenger syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION B: Arrhythmia : Closure of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) can help to avoid or correct arrhythmias.

OPTION C: Heart attack: Correction of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) is not directly related to preventing or correcting a heart attack. A heart attack, also known as a myocardial infarction, occurs when there is a blockage in one of the coronary arteries supplying blood to the heart muscle, resulting in damage to the heart tissue. OPTION D: Respiratory Alkalosis: VSDs can result in increased blood flow to the lungs, leading to a condition called pulmonary overcirculation. This increased blood flow can cause respiratory alkalosis, which is characterized by a decrease in carbon dioxide levels and an increase in pH in the blood.

Aside from severe malnutrition, they often suffer from serious infections such as diarrhea, pneumonia, sepsis, malaria, and skin infections. Urgent attention and intervention are required to address their critical condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Lumirubin Phototherapy : Bilirubin can absorb blue light (420-470 nm) maximally. Phototherapy deals with the exposure of the jaundiced neonates to blue light . By a process called structural isomerization, the toxic native unconjugated bilirubin gets converted into a non-toxic isomer namely Lumirubin . Lumirubin can be easily excreted by the kidneys in the unconjugated form (in contrast to bilirubin which cannot be excreted). Serum bilirubin is monitored every 12-24 hours, and phototherapy is continuously carried out till the serum bilirubin becomes normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Phototherapy converts bilirubin to lumirubin by exposing the newborn to special lights. Lumirubin is a water-soluble form of bilirubin that can be easily excreted from the body through urine and stool. This helps to reduce bilirubin levels and alleviate symptoms of jaundice in newborns. Phototherapy is a safe and effective treatment method commonly used in hospitals and neonatal care units.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION B: Biliverdin: Biliverdin is an intermediate product in the breakdown of heme, which is converted into bilirubin. It is not the end product of bilirubin conversion in phototherapy. OPTION C: Urobilin : Urobilin is a yellow pigment formed from the breakdown of bilirubin in the intestines. It is responsible for the color of urine. Urobilin is not directly involved in the conversion of bilirubin in phototherapy. OPTION C: Stercobilin : Stercobilin is a brown pigment formed from the breakdown of bilirubin in the intestines. It is responsible for the color of stool. Like urobilin, stercobilin is not directly related to the conversion of bilirubin during phototherapy.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
