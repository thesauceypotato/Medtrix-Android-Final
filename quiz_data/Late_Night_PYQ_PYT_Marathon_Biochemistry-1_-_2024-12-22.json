D)\u00a0RNA editing</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The difference between Apo B 48 and Apo B 100 is due to RNA editing. In the intestine, a specific cytidine in the mRNA for Apo B is deaminated to uridine, which changes the codon from one encoding amino acid to a stop codon. This results in the production of a shorter protein, Apo B 48. In the liver, this editing does not occur, so the full-length Apo B 100 is produced.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. DNA Gene Mutation in Intestines: Incorrect. The difference between Apo B 48 and Apo B 100 is not due to a DNA gene mutation specific to the intestines. Both proteins are derived from the same gene, and the variation in their production is not the result of a DNA mutation.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. DNA Gene Mutation in Intestines:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Point Mutation in Liver: Incorrect. Similarly, the production of these two forms of apolipoprotein B is not due to a point mutation in the liver. The liver produces Apo B 100, but this is not because of a mutation in the hepatic DNA.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Point Mutation in Liver:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. DNA Gene Splicing: Incorrect. While alternative splicing is a common mechanism in generating protein diversity, it is not the process responsible for the difference between Apo B 48 and Apo B 100.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

Infants with galactosemia are unable to break down galactose and its accumulation can lead to severe complications. Therefore, breastfeeding is an absolute contraindication for infants with galactosemia, and they require a special galactose-free formula.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. HIV: This option is incorrect. While HIV can be transmitted through breast milk, the transmission risk can be significantly reduced by antiretroviral therapy (ART) and other precautions. In certain situations, such as in resource-limited settings where safe alternatives to breastfeeding are not available, the benefits of breastfeeding may outweigh the risks of HIV transmission. However, in areas where safe and affordable alternatives are accessible, avoiding breastfeeding is generally recommended for infants born to HIV-positive mothers.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.</li><li>\u2022 HIV:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Hepatitis B: This option is incorrect. Breastfeeding is not an absolute contraindication for infants born to mothers with hepatitis B. Transmission of hepatitis B through breast milk is considered low, and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that infants receive the hepatitis B vaccine and a dose of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth to prevent transmission. Breastfeeding can generally continue in these cases.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.</li><li>\u2022 Hepatitis B:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Cytomegalovirus infection: This option is incorrect. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can be transmitted through breast milk, but the transmission risk can be reduced. In most cases, breastfeeding is not an absolute contraindication for infants with CMV infection. Precautions such as pasteurization of breast milk or using frozen breast milk from before the infection occurred can be taken to reduce the risk of transmission.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.</li><li>\u2022 Cytomegalovirus infection:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The question aims to identify conditions where breastfeeding is absolutely contraindicated.

This is because glucose and galactose are absorbed from intestine via SGLT-1, which is active transport and absorbs all of glucose & galactose, even against the concentration gradient.
