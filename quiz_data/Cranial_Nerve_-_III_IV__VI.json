      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Olfactory nerve; anosmia due to damaged olfactory nerve rootlets The olfactory nerve is damaged; anosmia due to injury to the olfactory nerve rootlet is because of fracture of the cribriform plate of ethmoid from which it is passing. As the patient has anosmia which is the loss of sense of smell. It may be temporary or permanent. And, we know that the cranial nerve first which is the olfactory nerve is responsible for carrying a sense of smell. Damage to the olfactory nerve can lead to anosmia-like conditions. Damage may be at any part of the olfactory pathway. But the patient has bleeding from the nose as well as CSF flowing out with the blood that indicated the fracture of the cribriform plate of ethmoid that's why the CSF can easily flow from the anterior cranial cavity to the nasal openings.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Incorrect Because the optic nerve is not related to the sense of smell, which is damaged in the patient. The main function of the optic nerve is in the vision process. Orbicularis oculi is the muscle of the eyelids around the orbital openings. Option: C. Incorrect The olfactory nerve is responsible for the sense of smell, which is lost in the patient, so yes there is damage to the olfactory nerve injury to the nasal septum can cause bleeding from the nose, but nasal septum injuries never cause CSF flowing out through the nose CSF can only be found in nasal bleeding when there is an injury to the anterior cranial fossa or cribriform plate of the ethmoid.</p>\n<p></p>",

Lesions of the cranial nerve VI (abducens) nucleus in the pons cause ipsilateral, lateral gaze palsy. The given image is of Cavernous Sinus where = Oculomotor Nerve (III) = Abducent Nerve (VI) = Ophthalmic Nerve (V) = Maxillary Nerve Oculomotor nerve palsy will result in a characteristic down and out the position in the affected eye. The eye will be displaced outward \"exotropia\" and displaced downward \"hypotropia\"; outward because the lateral rectus (innervated by the sixth cranial nerve) maintains muscle tone in comparison to the paralyzed medial rectus. The eye will be displaced downward, because the superior oblique (innervated by the fourth cranial or trochlear nerve), is unantagonized by the paralyzed superior rectus, inferior rectus and inferior oblique. The affected individual will also have ptosis, drooping of the eyelid, and mydriasis (pupil dilation). In injury of the ophthalmic nerve, there is loss of corneal blink reflex. The maxillary nerve is the second branch of the trigeminal nerve, which originates embryologically from the first pharyngeal arch. Its primary function is sensory supply to the mid-third of the face. In cases of injury to the maxillary nerve, there is a loss of the sneeze reflex. This branch is the afferent path for the sneeze reflex.</p>\n<p></p>",
