      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1, & 3 are correct Statements:  1 and 3. Glucose and Galactose Galactose and Glucose are transported into mucosal cells by an active , energy-requiring process that requires a concurrent uptake of sodium ions and this transport protein is SGLT-1 (Sodium-dependent Glucose Tramantransport). Sodium-dependent transporter of glucose SGLT-1 \u2192 Small intestine and Kidneys \u2192 for Glucose and Galactose SGLT-2 \u2192 Kidneys \u2192 only for Glucose</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Statement: 4. Fructose Fructose uptake requires a sodium-independent monosaccharide transporter GLUT-5 for its absorption. It is present in the small intestine, and testis (seminal fluid) as the major energy source of sperm is fructose. Statement: 2 and 5: Sucrose and maltose The sucrose and maltose upon digestion by intestinal enzymes also give rise to glucose. However, if we read the question carefully, the question is asking about absorption only but not digestion and then absorption of these sugars. The conversion of disaccharides to monosaccharides is considered under digestion. so, it is more apt to choose all four (A, B, C, and E) only if there is digestion and absorption mentioned in the question.</p>\n<p></p>",
