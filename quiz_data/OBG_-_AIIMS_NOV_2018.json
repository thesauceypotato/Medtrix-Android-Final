Therefore, we prefer a hysterectomy unless the woman wants to preserve the uterus. Here the age is 55 years so definitely no use of the uterus and therefore option A.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Endometriosis versus Adenomyosis Variable Endometriosis Adenomyosis Definition Functional endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus. Endometrial tissue in the myometrium of the uterus. History/PE Cyclic pelvic and/or rectal pain and dyspareunia. Uterus not enlarged but painful nodules, restricted range of motion. The classic triad of pain, menorrhagia, and an enlarged, boggy, symmetric uterus. Diagnosis \u2022   Requires direct visualization by laparoscopy or laparotomy. \u2022   MRI can aid in diagnosis but is costly. \u2022   Classic lesions have a blue-black (\u201craspberry\u201d) or dark brown (\u201cpowder-burned\u201d) appearance. \u2022   Ultrasonography is useful but cannot always distinguish between leiomyoma and adenomyosis. \u2022   The ovaries may have endometriomas (\u201cchocolate cysts\u201d). \u2022   Ultimately a pathologic diagnosis. Treatment \u2022   Pharmacologic: Inhibits ovulation. Combination OCPs (first line), GnRH analogues (Leuprolide), Danazol, NSAIDs, or progestins. \u2022   Pharmacologic: Largely symptomatic relief. NSAIDs (first line) plus OCPs or progestins. \u2022   Conservative surgical treatment: Excision, cauterization, or ablation of the lesions and lysis of adhesions. Twenty per cent of patients can become pregnant subsequent to treatment. \u2022   Conservative surgical treatment: Endometrial ablation or resection using hysteroscopy. Complete eradication of deep adenomyosis is difficult and results in \uf0ad treatment failure. \u2022   Definitive surgical treatment: TAH/BSO \u00b1 lysis of adhesions. \u2022   Definitive surgical treatment: Hysterectomy is the only definitive treatment. Complications Infertility (the most common cause among menstruating women >30 years of age). May rarely progress to endometrial carcinoma. Types of Endometrial Cancer Variable Type I: Endometrioid Type II: Serous Epidemiology 75% of endometrial cancers 25% of endometrial cancers Etiology Unopposed estrogen stimulation (e.g., tamoxifen use, exogenous estrogen-only therapy) Unrelated to estrogen; the p53 mutation is present in 90% of cases Precursor lesion Hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia None Mean age at diagnosis 55 years 67 years Prognosis Favourable Poor</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options B, C and D are false.</p>\n<p></p>",

Both give long-lasting contraceptive fertility. Laparoscopic tubal ligation is the most common modality of pregnancy prevention. It is irreversible in nature. Spring-loaded clips (Filshie clip, Hulka clip) or Silastic rubber bands (Falope ring) are most commonly used. Destruction or removal of a segment of the oviduct is performed in an operating room through a transabdominal approach usually using a laparoscopy or mini-laparotomy. An ectopic pregnancy should be ruled out if the procedure fails.
