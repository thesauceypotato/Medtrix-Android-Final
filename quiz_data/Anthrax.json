The patient works in the mail room at a large company, does not smoke cigarettes, and drinks alcohol occasionally. Chest imaging shows lung infiltrates and a prominent widening of the mediastinum. Sputum and blood cultures yield large, gram-positive rods that form colonies resembling a \"Medusa head.\" Which of the following is the most likely bacterial virulence factor contributing to this patient's condition?",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Antiphagocytic D-glutamate capsule Bacillus anthracis is a large, nonmotile, nonhemolytic, gram-positive rod that forms colonies in culture with multiple curled extensions at the edges that resemble a \"Medusa head.\" It has an antiphagocytic polypeptide glutamate capsule.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Bacillus Anthracis: Because the organism proliferates in soil contaminated with manure, pasture-grazing herbivores such as sheep, cattle, and horses are at greatest risk for infection. However, transmission to humans occasionally occurs when B anthracis spores are inhaled, ingested, or inoculated into the skin. I nhalation of spores into the alveoli causes pulmonary anthrax. Alveolar macrophages phagocytose the spores and bring them to mediastinal lymph nodes, where the spores germinate into vegetative rods and multiply. The vegetative form of the bacteria contains a polypeptide capsule composed of D-glutamic acid, which is antiphagocytic. anthracis rods also produce a potent exotoxin complex composed of edema factor, lethal factor, and protective antigen, which enter host cells and cause cell death. Initial manifestations of infection are nonspecific (eg, myalgia, fever, malaise), but the proliferation of the bacteria in the mediastinum eventually causes hemorrhagic mediastinitis (often visible on chest x-ray as a widened mediastinum). Subsequent dissemination through the bloodstream causes shock, brain edema/haemorrhage, and death. Although pulmonary anthrax is quite rare, it can be seen in individuals who handle contaminated hides or animal hair (\" Woolsorter's disease\") or those exposed to aerosolized biologic weapons (eg, opening contaminated mail).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Many bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae) are resistant to phagocytosis due to the presence of a polysaccharide capsule. However, B anthracis has a polypeptide, not a polysaccharide capsule. Option C. Staphylococcus aureus produces protein A , which binds the Fc portion of IgG. This inhibits opsonization and complement-mediated killing of the bacteria. Option D. I ntracellular polyphosphate granules are characteristic of Corynebacterium diphtheriae ; they can be visualized on microscopy after growing the pathogen on the Loeffler medium and staining it with methylene blue.</p>\n<p></p>",

(See below)</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>B. anthracis has a number of virulence factors: Capsule: Under anaerobic conditions, a polypeptide capsule consisting of poly- D- glutamic acid is produced. Synthesis of the capsule is by three enzymes encoded by the capA, capB, and capC genes on the pX- 02 plasmids. A fourth protein, encoded by the dep gene, catalyses the formation of polyglutamate that inhibit phagocytosis; Toxin : Two binary toxins (o) edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF) bind a third toxin component protective antigen (PA) , before entering the target cell. The three toxin components are also encoded on plasmid pX- 01. LF is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase that inhibits dendritic cell function. EF converts AMP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), resulting in the dysregulation of water and ions.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Plasmid is responsible for the toxin and capsule production. The gamma phage lysis assay is a common diagnostic method for the identification of B. anthracis and is based on the bacterium's susceptibility to lysis. Option B. Cutaneous anthrax heals on its own, but antimicrobial therapy reduces the edema and necrosis to a great extent (oral ciprofloxacin for 5 -7 days). Option C. capsule is polypeptide in nature and prevents phagocytosis.</p>\n<p></p>",
