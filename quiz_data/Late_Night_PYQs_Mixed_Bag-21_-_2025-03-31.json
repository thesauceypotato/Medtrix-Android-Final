Notch at 2000Hz is indicative of Noise Induced hearing loss: A notch at 2000Hz on bone conduction is known as Carhart's notch, which is indicative of otosclerosis, not noise-induced hearing loss.

Notch at 2000Hz is indicative of Noise Induced hearing loss:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Associated M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is not a contraindication for stapes surgery: M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is indeed a contraindication for stapes surgery. The presence of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease can lead to complications such as irritation of the saccule during the surgery, causing vertigo and giddiness.

B) Facial nerve</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The patient's symptoms, including ear pain, difficulty eating, and inability to close the eye completely, strongly suggest a case of facial palsy or Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy is a condition characterized by sudden weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles, typically affecting one side of the face. The facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) is responsible for controlling the muscles of facial expression, and its dysfunction leads to the presented symptoms.</li><li>\u2022 The presence of a swelling below the ear further supports the involvement of the facial nerve. The parotid gland, located in this region, is closely associated with the facial nerve, which divides into five terminal branches within the gland. Damage or inflammation of the parotid gland can lead to compression or involvement of the facial nerve, resulting in facial palsy.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Great auricular nerve: Incorrect. While the great auricular nerve provides sensory innervation over the angle of the mandible and the area around the ear (shaving area), it is not directly responsible for the motor functions affected in this case. If the patient had ear pain or loss of sensation in the shaving area without the Bell's palsy features, the great auricular nerve could have been considered.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Great auricular nerve:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Vagus nerve: Incorrect. The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) does not directly control the facial muscles or cause the symptoms described here.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Vagus nerve:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Auriculotemporal nerve: Incorrect. The auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, supplies sensory innervation to the auricle and temporal region but does not control the facial muscles or cause the symptoms of facial palsy. If the patient had symptoms like increased sweating, redness, or blood supply in this area, it could have suggested an auriculotemporal nerve syndrome (Frey's syndrome).</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
