      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Sevoflurane The inhalational induction agent commonly used in children is Sevoflurane Sevoflurane is favored for its rapid onset and minimal irritation, making it ideal for inhalational induction in pediatric patients. Sevoflurane : It is the preferred inhalational agent for induction in pediatric patients due to its rapid onset, minimal airway irritation, and pleasant odor, making it easier for children to tolerate.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Nitrous Oxide : Often used as a supplement to other agents rather than as a primary induction agent due to its analgesic properties. Option: B. Isoflurane : Effective for maintenance of anesthesia but less commonly used for induction in children because of its pungent odor and potential airway irritation. Option: D. Desflurane : Not typically used for induction in children due to its high vapor pressure and irritating properties, which can make it difficult for children to tolerate.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA INHALED ANESTHETICS (children) HALOTHANE \u25cf       agent of choice for inhalational induction in children ( before sevoflurane ) \u25cf       potent agent with slower induction \u25cf       myocardial depressant \u25cf       arrhythmias SEVOFLURANE \u25cf agent of choice for inhalational induction in children \u25cf       MAC similar with infant and neonates \u25cf       epileptiform changes in EEG ( higher doses) \u25cf       Emergency delirium ISOFLURANE \u25cf       more potent than sevoflurane \u25cf       noxious smell NITROUS OXIDE \u25cf       speed uptake of more potent anesthetics \u25cf       can be used for induction in cooperative children \u25cf       Used alone or in conjunction with other agents ( procedural sedation or analgesia in children) \u25cf       Role in maintenance decreased due to increased risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting XENON \u25cf       odorless , anesthetic gas with low potency \u25cf       superior anesthetic for children with significant congenital heart disease ( only preliminary data) DESFLURANE \u25cf       pungent odor \u25cf       causes laryngospasm ( not used for induction) \u25cf       used for maintenance of anesthesia in children</p>\n<p></p>",
