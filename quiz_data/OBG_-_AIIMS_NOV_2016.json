The continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury physical or mental health; or There is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped. 3. In determining whether the continuance of pregnancy would involve such risk of injury to the health as is mentioned in sub-section (2), account may be taken of the pregnant woman's actual or reasonable foreseeable environment. (a) No pregnancy of a woman, who has not attained the age of eighteen years, or, who, having attained the age of eighteen years, is a lunatic, shall be terminated except with the consent in writing of her guardian. (b) Same as otherwise provided in Cl.(a), no pregnancy shall be terminated except with the consent of the pregnant woman. 1.\tPlace where pregnancy may be terminated. - No termination of pregnancy shall be made in accordance with this Act at any place other than, - (a) A hospital established or maintained by Government, or (b) A place for the time being approved for the purpose of this Act by Government.</p>\n<p></p>",

In the section for cervical dilatation and fetal head descent, there are two diagonal lines labelled Alert and Action. The Alert line starts at 4 cm of cervical dilatation and it travels diagonally upwards to the point of expected full dilatation (10 cm) at the rate of 1 cm per hour. The Action line is parallel to the Alert line, and 4 hours to the right of the Alert line. These two lines are designed to warn you to take action quickly if the labour is not progressing normally. You should refer the woman to a health centre or hospital if the marks recording cervical dilatation cross over the Alert line, i.e. indicating that cervical dilation is proceeding too slowly. (The Action line is for making decisions at health- facility level.)</p>\n<p></p>",

Chromic (and therefore, plain) catgut has been found to be unacceptable because of its early loss of tensile strength. Taking deep bites of tissue is important and for continuous closure, a suture length to wound length ratio of at least 4:1.is recommended. This is easily done when closing the abdominal wall by placing sutures 2 cm from the fascial wound edge and 2 em apart, which will result in a ratio of 4.2:1 results of some of the more recent randomized studies follow.</p>\n<p></p>",

However, the magnitude of the net benefit will differ among age groups and may extend to younger and older women depending on their baseline risk of CIN2+. Priority should be given to screening women aged 30-49 years, rather than maximizing the number of screening tests in a woman's lifetime. (Option B is true) Screening even once in a lifetime would be beneficial. Screening intervals may depend on financial, infrastructural, and other resources. The recommendations include strategies based on three screening tests: 1. HPV (cut-off level \u2265 1.0 pg/ml), 2. cytology (cut-off level ASCUS+, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance), and 3. VIA (visual inspection with acetic acid) VIA is appropriate to use in women whose transformation zone is visible (typically in those younger than 50). This is because once menopause occurs, the transformation zone, where most precancerous lesions occur, frequently recedes into the endocervical canal and prevents it from being fully visible (Option C : False). Recommendation for follow up after screening: In women who test negative on VIA or cytology (Pap smear), the screening interval for repeat screening should be every three to five years (Option D: true). In women who test negative on an HPV test, rescreening should be done after a minimum interval of five years (Option A : True).</p>\n<p></p>",

In addition to normal 46,XY chromosomes, the presence of testes and normal or elevated testosterone and LH levels are common to all such children Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) It is an extreme form of failure of virilization, genetic males appear female at birth and are invariably reared accordingly. The external genitalia are female. The vagina ends blindly in a pouch, and the uterus is absent as a result of the normal production and effect of AMH by the testes. In about one third of patients, unilateral or bilateral fallopian tube remnants are found. The testes are usually intra-abdominal but may descend into the inguinal canal; they consist largely of seminiferous tubules. At puberty, there is normal development of breasts and the habitus is female, but menstruation does not occur and sexual hair is absent. Adult heights of these women are commensurate with those of normal males despite profound congenital deficiency of androgenic effects. Complete gonadal dysgenesis No gonadal development occurs Patients have a completely female phenotype due to the lack of any gonadal steroid production, but at pubertal age, breast development and menarche fail to occur.
