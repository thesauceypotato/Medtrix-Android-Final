The key pressures involved are the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, which drives filtration, and the oncotic pressure, which opposes it. Additionally, the hydrostatic pressure within Bowman's capsule also opposes filtration.</li><li>\u2022 Increase in Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure : This is the back pressure exerted by the fluid already in Bowman's capsule. If this pressure increases, it opposes the hydrostatic pressure of the glomerular capillaries, leading to a decrease in GFR.

Decrease in glomerular capillary oncotic pressure</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

It helps in visualizing the placental attachment and identifying abnormalities in placental implantation. Color Doppler ultrasonography is particularly useful to assess the blood flow and the vascularity of the placenta, which can indicate abnormal adherence. MRI (2) : MRI is used as a complementary imaging tool when ultrasonography results are inconclusive or to provide a more detailed view. It helps in evaluating the depth of placental invasion into the myometrium and can differentiate between placenta accreta, increta, and percreta. Angiography (3) : While angiography can provide information about blood vessels and may be used in some cases to evaluate blood flow abnormalities, it is not typically a primary diagnostic tool for placenta accreta. It may be used in specific scenarios or to plan surgical management, but it is not generally used for initial diagnosis. X-ray (4) : X-rays are not used in the diagnosis of placenta accreta due to their lack of sensitivity for soft tissue detail and the potential risk to the fetus.

Internal capsule</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Above marked structure is internal capsule.</li><li>\u2022 The internal capsule is a critical white matter structure in the brain. It is located deep within the cerebral hemispheres and separates the caudate nucleus and the thalamus from the putamen and the globus pallidus. The internal capsule contains axon tracts that serve as major pathways for communication between different parts of the brain, including the cortex, thalamus, and various subcortical nuclei.</li><li>\u2022 The internal capsule is often subdivided into three parts: the anterior limb, genu (knee), and posterior limb. Each limb contains different types of nerve fibers that transmit motor, sensory, and other information between the cerebral cortex and other brain regions.</li><li>\u2022 The internal capsule consists of several parts and is V-shaped when cut horizontally, in a transverse plane.</li><li>\u2022 the bend in the V is called the genu the anterior limb or crus anterius is the part in front of the genu, between the head of the caudate nucleus and the lenticular nucleus the posterior limb or crus posterius is the part behind the genu, between the thalamus and lenticular nucleus the retrolenticular portion is caudal to the lenticular nucleus and carries the optic radiation (from medial part of lateral geniculate nucleus) also known as the geniculocalcarine tract. The fiber from lateral part of lateral geniculate nucleus is carried through the retrolenticular portion. the sublenticular portion is beneath the lenticular nucleus and are tracts involved in the auditory pathway from the medial geniculate nucleus to the primary auditory cortex (Brodmann areas 41 and 42)</li><li>\u2022 the bend in the V is called the genu</li><li>\u2022 the anterior limb or crus anterius is the part in front of the genu, between the head of the caudate nucleus and the lenticular nucleus</li><li>\u2022 anterior limb or crus anterius</li><li>\u2022 the posterior limb or crus posterius is the part behind the genu, between the thalamus and lenticular nucleus</li><li>\u2022 posterior limb or crus posterius</li><li>\u2022 the retrolenticular portion is caudal to the lenticular nucleus and carries the optic radiation (from medial part of lateral geniculate nucleus) also known as the geniculocalcarine tract.

External Capsule : The external capsule is another white matter structure located in the brain, but it is less well-known than the internal capsule. It is located lateral to the putamen and globus pallidus and is considered part of the deep gray matter of the basal ganglia. The exact function and significance of the external capsule are still a subject of ongoing research, and its role in brain function is not as well-defined as that of the internal capsule.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. External Capsule</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Caudate Lobe : The caudate lobe, also known as the caudate nucleus, is a part of the basal ganglia. It is a C-shaped structure located within each cerebral hemisphere. The caudate nucleus is involved in various functions, including motor control, cognition, and emotional processing. It is interconnected with other basal ganglia nuclei and plays a role in regulating movement. Lesions or dysfunction in the caudate nucleus can lead to movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Caudate Lobe</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Globus Pallidus : The globus pallidus is another component of the basal ganglia. It is divided into two segments: the external segment (GPe) and the internal segment (GPi). The globus pallidus is involved in motor control and plays a role in modulating motor signals sent from the cortex to the thalamus. Dysfunctions of the globus pallidus can result in movement disorders, including dystonia and Parkinson's disease.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Globus Pallidus</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The internal capsule's strategic location and structure facilitate critical communication pathways in the brain, making its integrity vital for normal motor and sensory functions.
