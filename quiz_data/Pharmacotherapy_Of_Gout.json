If a large dose (> 150 mg/kg or > 10 g in an adult) is taken, serious toxicity can occur. Fatality is common with > 250 mg/kg</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mechanism of toxicity N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NABQI) is a highly reactive arylating minor metabolite of paracetamol which is detoxified by conjugation with glutathione. When a very large dose of paracetamol is taken, glucuronidation capacity is saturated, more of the minor metabolite is formed\u2014hepatic glutathione is depleted and this metabolite binds covalently to proteins in liver cells (and renal tubules) causing necrosis. Toxicity thus shows a threshold effect manifesting only when glutathione is depleted to a critical point. In chronic alcoholics, even 5 g taken in one day can result in hepatotoxicity because alcoholism induces CYP2E1 that metabolizes paracetamol to NABQI</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. valproat e ( VPA ), and its valproic acid, sodium valproate, and valproate semisodium forms, are medications primarily used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder and to prevent migraine headaches. They are useful for the prevention of seizures in those with absence seizures, partial seizures, and generalized seizures. Option: C. Warfarin is a medication that is used as an anticoagulant (blood thinner). It is commonly used to treat blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and to prevent stroke in people who have atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease or artificial heart valves. Option: D . Tetracycline , is an oral antibiotic in the tetracyclines family of medications, used to treat a number of infections, including acne, cholera, brucellosis, plague, malaria, and syphilis.
