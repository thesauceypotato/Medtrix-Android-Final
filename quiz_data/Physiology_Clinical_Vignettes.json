This ingestion leads to a decrease in plasma osmolarity, triggering the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH promotes water reabsorption in the kidneys, resulting in the production of large volumes of dilute urine.</li><li>\u2022 In contrast, Amit consumes 2 liters of isotonic NaCl solution, which does not alter plasma osmolarity. Consequently, there is minimal ADH release, and the kidneys excrete a smaller volume of urine that is isotonic to plasma.</li><li>\u2022 Therefore, Samit's urine will be more dilute compared to Amit's, leading to a higher urine osmolarity in Amit's case.</li><li>\u2022 Incorrect options:</li><li>\u2022 A. Greater change in intracellular fluid (ICF) volume: Drinking distilled water can cause water to enter cells, leading to cell swelling. However, the question focuses on urine osmolarity, not ICF volume.</li><li>\u2022 B. Higher positive free-water clearance (CH 2 O): Free-water clearance is a measure of the kidney's ability to excrete water without solute. While Samit's ingestion of distilled water increases CH 2 O, the question asks for the effect on urine osmolarity, not CH 2 O.</li><li>\u2022 C. Greater change in plasma osmolarity: Drinking distilled water decreases plasma osmolarity, while isotonic NaCl ingestion has no effect. However, the question asks about urine osmolarity, not plasma osmolarity.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u2022 In sepsis, the body's metabolic rate increases, leading to elevated production of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). To efficiently transport this excess CO 2 from tissues to the lungs for exhalation, the body utilizes the bicarbonate buffer system. Within red blood cells (RBCs), CO 2 is converted to bicarbonate (HCO 3 - ) through the action of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. This conversion results in the production of HCO 3 - , which then diffuses out of the RBCs into the plasma. To maintain electrical neutrality, chloride ions enter the RBCs from the plasma, a process known as the \"chloride shift.\" This mechanism ensures that the increased CO 2 produced during sepsis is effectively transported in the form of bicarbonate, with chloride ions compensating for the loss of bicarbonate from the RBCs.</li><li>\u2022 Incorrect Options:</li><li>\u2022 A. Carbaminohemoglobin (carbon dioxide bound to hemoglobin) becomes the primary transport carrier of the additional carbon dioxide: While carbaminohemoglobin does play a role in CO 2 transport, it is not the primary mechanism for handling the increased CO 2 produced during sepsis. The bicarbonate buffer system, involving the chloride shift, is the main pathway for CO 2 transport under these conditions.</li><li>\u2022 C. The additional dissolved carbon dioxide becomes converted to bicarbonate, which binds to hemoglobin: Although CO 2 is converted to bicarbonate within RBCs, the bicarbonate primarily diffuses into the plasma rather than binding to hemoglobin. Hemoglobin does bind to CO 2 , but this is a separate process from the bicarbonate buffering system.</li><li>\u2022 D. Dissolved CO 2 becomes the primary transport carrier of the additional carbon dioxide: Dissolved CO 2 accounts for a small fraction of CO 2 transport. The majority is transported as bicarbonate ions in the plasma, with chloride ions entering RBCs to maintain charge balance.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

This method involves the patient sitting in a sealed chamber and breathing through a mouthpiece. By applying Boyle's Law, which relates pressure and volume, the test calculates lung volumes based on pressure changes within the chamber. This technique is particularly useful for assessing lung volumes in patients with obstructive lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where other methods might be less accurate.</li><li>\u2022 Incorrect Options:</li><li>\u2022 A.

He-Dilution method: The helium dilution method estimates lung volumes by having the patient breathe in a known concentration of helium and measuring the dilution of the gas.
