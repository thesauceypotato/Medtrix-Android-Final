If penicillamine is given, it should always be accompanied by pyridoxine (25 mg/d). Option: B: Trientine is a less toxic chelator and is supplanting penicillamine when a chelator is indicated. Option: D: For initial neurologic therapy, tetrathiomolybdate is emerging as the drug of choice because of its rapid control of free copper, preservation of neurologic function, and low toxicity.</p>\n<p></p>",
