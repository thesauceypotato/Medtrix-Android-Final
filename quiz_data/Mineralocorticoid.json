Hypokalemia leads to a loss of potassium from cells largely in exchange for H+. This causes metabolic alkalosis and intracellular acidosis .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Adrenal glands have an outer cortical region that produces mineralocorticoids (aldosterone), glucocorticoids (cortisol), and androgenic hormones. The inner, medullary region of the adrenal gland is highly innervated and produces the circulating sympathetic hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. The adrenocortical hormones are steroid hormones. The steroid hormones are permeable to the cell membrane; thus, their rate of secretion is dependent on their rate of production. Cortisol production is dependent on ACTH and in part is controlled by a negative feedback loop with cortisol-inhibiting ACTH production. In the present case, there is an increase in ACTH secretion that causes an overproduction of cortisol (Cushing syndrome). Adrenal hyperplasia also can cause the overproduction of cortisol. Understanding the mechanisms of action of the adrenocortical hormones has produced a number of novel therapies for the control of hypertension (ACE inhibitors), anti-inflammatories (COX 2 inhibitors), and immunosuppression (cortisol).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: D. Renal tubular cells respond with an increase in the rate of H+ secretion. Option: A. Paradoxically, despite the metabolic alkalosis, there is an increased rate of H+ secretion and bicarbonate reabsorption with the addition of bicarbonate to the blood. There is increased reabsorption of bicarbonate and maintenance of metabolic alkalosis. Option: C. hypokalemia leads to a loss of potassium from cells largely in exchange for H+ .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The Physiology of Mineralocorticoids The mineralocorticoids, primarily aldosterone, are essential for the maintenance of salt and water balance by the kidney by regulating sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. Aldosterone is produced in the zona glomerulosa from the common pregnenolone precursor. Regulation of aldosterone secretion is dependent on several factors. ACTH-dependent pregnenolone synthesis is required for maximal aldosterone production, but secretion is controlled directly by angiotensin II and the extracellular ([K+]) potassium concentration. Increasing plasma [K+] stimulates aldosterone secre- tion. Atrial natriuretic factor has a negative modulatory effect on aldosterone secretion. As with the other adrenal cortical hormones, aldosterone binds to and is carried in the blood by corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG). The physiologic role of aldosterone is the maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance, and its secretion is tightly coupled to the vascular volume. A decrease in vascular volume initiates a cascade response with an increase in renal renin secretion from smooth muscle cells of the afferent glomerular arteriole. Renin catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The target of angiotensin II is the zona glomerulosa, which responds by increasing the production and secretion of aldosterone.</p>\n<p></p>",

At each stage of metabolism, enzymes have been identified as cortisol-dependent, beginning with the generation of glucogenic precursors. Muscle protein catabolism is an essential source of carbohydrate precursors. Key enzymes in the gluconeogenic pathway ranging from pyruvate to glycogen and those involved in the release of glucose from the liver are all known to be inducible by cortisol. Thus, one of its main functions is the continued production of glucose for metabolism by glucose-dependent tissues during a fast. Glucose utilization by tissues that can utilize alternative fuels is reduced by cortisol, which antagonizes insulin-dependent processes. To provide the energy necessary for gluconeogenesis, cortisol enhances triglyceride breakdown and free fatty acid mobilization from fat stores.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A. cortisol, which antagonizes insulin-dependent processes .
