      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Falciform Ligament The falciform ligament is the thin, sickle-shaped, fibrous structure that connects the anterior part of the liver to the ventral wall of the abdomen . It can be seen drooping from the liver hilum when looking inside the abdomen during surgery.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Falciform ligament from the anterior abdominal wall encloses the liver. At porta hepatis, it forms a lesser omentum which encloses the stomach. The two layers pass to the left towards the spleen as gastrosplenic ligament. At the hilum, the two layers of gastrosplenic ligament diverge. The anterior layer encloses the spleen, forms one layer of lienorenal ligament, covers the left kidney and continues to line the structures in the anterior abdominal wall. The posterior layer forms the other layer of lienorenal ligament and lines the structures in the posterior abdominal wall. The two layers get reflected as a falciform ligament on the liver. Horizontal section through the supracolic compartment of the abdomen showing the horizontal disposition of the peritoneum</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. The portion of the greater omentum that extends from the greater curvature of the stomach to the inferior surface of the diaphragm Option B. The phrenicocolic ligament, also known as Hensing's ligament, is a peritoneal ligament extending from the splenic flexure of the colon to the diaphragm Option D . The lienorenal ligament lies between the left kidney and the spleen. The splenic vessels pass between its two layers. It contains the tail of the pancreas which is the only intraperitoneal portion of the pancreas. It is a mesente ric fold passing from the spleen to the left kidney and affording support to the splenic artery and vein .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Lesser omentum is a fold of peritoneum which extends from the lesser curvature of the stomach and the first 2 cm of the duodenum to the liver. The portion of the lesser omentum between the stomach and the liver is called the hepatogastric ligament, and the portion between the duodenum and the liver is called the hepatoduodenal ligament.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Incus The incus or anvil is a bone in the middle ear . The anvil -shaped small bone is one of three ossicles in the middle ear. The incus receives vibrations from the malleus , to which it is connected laterally, and transmits these to the stapes medially. The incus is so-called because of its resemblance to an anvil.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The incus is the second of the ossicles, three bones in the middle ear which act to transmit sound. It is shaped like an anvil, and has a long and short crus extending from the body, which articulates with the malleus.The short crus attaches to the posterior ligament of the incus. The long crus articulates with the stirrup at the lenticular process.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- So, Option A - Malleus - not the correct option. Option C - stapes - not the correct option.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Vibrations in the middle ear are received via the tympanic membrane. The malleus, resting on the membrane, conveys vibrations to the incus. This in turn conveys vibrations to the stapes.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>C The given clinical features of headache with periorbital pain, photophobia, tearing lacrimation, drooling of saliva, jaw spasm, pain, with light and accommodation reflex normal and pupils neither dilated nor constricted represents Involvement of trigeminal nerve . Cranial cavity showing the nerves emerging out Option C is Trigeminal nerve, therefore it is the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The trigeminal nerve is the fifth cranial nerve (CN V) and the largest of the cranial nerves. Its primary function is to provide sensory innervation to the face and is divided into three main branches. The different branches are the ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3) nerves.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - CN - II Option B - CN - III Option D - CN - VI</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The ophthalmic and maxillary nerves are purely sensory, whereas the mandibular nerve supplies motor as well as sensory (or \"cutaneous\") functions. Adding to the complexity of this nerve is that autonomic nerve fibers as well as special sensory fibers (taste) are contained within it. The motor division of the trigeminal nerve derives from the basal plate of the embryonic pons, and the sensory division originates in the cranial neural crest.</p>\n<p></p>",
