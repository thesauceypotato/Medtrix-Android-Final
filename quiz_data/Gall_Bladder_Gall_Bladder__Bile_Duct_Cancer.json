Plain radiographs: A plain X-ray may also show rare cases of calcification of the gallbladder, a so-called porcelain gallbladder . This is more commonly seen in computed tomography (CT). Traditionally, this has been considered an indication of cholecystectomy as it was associated with a high incidence of gallbladder carcinoma . However, contemporary data suggest that this may not be the case, with the true incidence of cancer being less than 5%. Therefore, decisions on whether or not a cholecystectomy should be performed should be individualised depending on the age of the patient, comorbidities and presence or absence of symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Porcelain Gallbladder Porcelain Gallbladder is characterized by extensive calcium encrustation of the gallbladder wall. The condition is caused by chronic inflammation of the gallbladder . Porcelain Gallbladder is usually associated with gallstones and is typically detected incidentally on plain abdominal radiographs, sonograms, or CT images. Most patients with Porcelain Gallbladder are asymptomatic , and the mean age of diagnosis is 54 years. There is a 6% incidence of carcinoma development in Porcelain Gallbladder cases. Surgery should not be delayed, even if the patient is asymptomatic, as the occurrence of carcinoma is remarkably high.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. If, a plain radiograph of the gallbladder will show radiopaque gallstones in 10% of patients. Rarely, the centre of a stone may contain radiolucent gas in a triradiate or biradiate fissure and this gives rise to characteristic dark shapes on a radiograph: the \u2018 Mercedes\u2013Benz \u2019 or \u2018 seagull sign\u2019 . Option: C. Gas may be seen in the wall of the gallbladder (emphysematous cholecystitis). Gas in the biliary tree may also be seen normally after endoscopic sphincterotomy or following a surgical anastomosis. Plain radiograph showing radiopaque stones in the gall- bladder.
