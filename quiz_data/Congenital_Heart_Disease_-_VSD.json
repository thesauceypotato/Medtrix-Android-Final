It is pinkish-red, macular and discrete, although some of these lesions may coalesce. It usually fades by the second day and rarely persists beyond 3 days after its appearance. Maternal infection in pregnancy may result in congenital rubella syndrome. Rubella affects the fetuses of up to 90% of all women who contract the infection during the first trimester of pregnancy.
