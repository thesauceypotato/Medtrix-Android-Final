This is suggestive of Brodie\u2019s abscess. Brodie abscess is an intraosseous abscess related to a focus of subacute pyogenic osteomyelitis. Unfortunately, there is no reliable way radiographically to exclude a focus of osteomyelitis. It has a protean radiographic appearance and can occur at any location and in a patient of any age. It might or might not be expansile, have a sclerotic or non sclerotic border, or have associated periostitis. Epidemiology Typically, these present in children with unfused epiphyseal plates, more frequently in boys. Location It has a predilection for ends (metaphysis) of tubular bones: P roximal/distal tibial metaphysis (most common) Carpal and tarsal bones Rarely traversing the open growth plate; epiphysis (in children and infants). Radiographic feature Plain radiograph lytic lesion often in an oval configuration that is oriented along the long axis of the bone surrounded by a thick dense rim of reactive sclerosis that fades imperceptibly into surrounding bone lucent tortuous channel extending toward growth plate prior to physeal closure (pathognomonic) periosteal new-bone formation +/- adjacent soft-tissue swelling</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Brodies Abscess It is localized form of sub acute osteomyelitis It usually involves long bones of lower extremity (metaphysis and diaphysis region) Intermittent pain is the usual complaint.

There is severe pain, swelling, and redness over the joint. Movements are severely restricted and the joint is held in the position of ease. Weight bearing on limb is not possible. Management is USG guided aspiration and arthrotomy Treatment Early stage -before any signs of joint destruction, correct diagnosis and aggressive treatment can save a joint from permanent damage.

Foot drop, sometimes called drop foot, is a general term for difficulty lifting the front part of the foot. Causes: Foot drop is caused by weakness or paralysis of the muscles involved in lifting the front part of the foot. Causes of foot drop might include: Nerve injury. The most common cause of foot drop is compression of a nerve in your leg that controls the muscles involved in lifting the foot (peroneal nerve) . This nerve can also be injured during hip or knee replacement surgery, which may cause foot drop. A nerve root injury \u2014 \u201cpinched nerve\u201d \u2014 in the spine can also cause foot drop. People who have diabetes are more susceptible to nerve disorders, which are associated with foot drop. Muscle or nerve disorders. Various forms of muscular dystrophy, an inherited disease that causes progressive muscle weakness, can contribute to foot drop. So can other disorders, such as polio or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Brain and spinal cord disorders. Disorders that affect the spinal cord or brain \u2014 such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple Sclerosis or stroke \u2014 may cause foot drop.

Older patients falling in a similar manner are more likely to sustain a distal radial fracture (usually a Colles fracture).

Clinical features: It occurs between the ages of 20 to 50 years. Women are affected about 3 times more commonly than men. Following presentations are common: An acute, symmetrical polyarthritis: Pain and stiffness in multiple joints (at least four) Symptoms of articular inflammation. The joints affected most commonly are the metacarpophalangeal joints, particularly that of the index finger. Other joints affected commonly are (given in Table): Common \u2022 MP joints of hand \u2022 PIP joints of fingers \u2022 Wrists, knees, elbows, ankles Less common \u2022 Hip joint \u2022 Temporomandibular joint Uncommon \u2022 Atlantoaxial joint \u2022 Facet joints of cervical spine On examination: Swollen boggy joints as a result of intra-articular effusion, synovial hypertrophy and oedema of the periarticular structures. The joints may be deformed. Deformities in Rheumatoid arthritis Hand \u2022 Ulnar drift of the hand \u2022 Boutonniere deformity \u2022 Swan neck deformity Elbow \u2022 Flexion deformity Knee \u2022 Early \u2013 Flexion deformity \u2022  Late \u2013 triple subluxation Ankle Equinus deformity Foot Hallux valgus, Hammer toe, etc. Treatment and prognosis Treatment of RA is aimed at improving the symptoms and slowing disease progression. Therapy is with a combination of corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and TNF antagonists (e.g. etanercept). Rheumatoid arthritis - X ray changes: The progress of disease is well shown in this patient's X - rays. First there was only soft tissue swelling and periarticular osteoporosis, later juxta - articular erosions appeared (arrow): ultimately the joints became unstable and deformed.</p>\n<p></p>",
