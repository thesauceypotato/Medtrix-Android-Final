This condition is also known as pulled elbow.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Nursemaid's elbow occurs when there is a partial separation of the radiocapitellar joint. Because a young child's ligaments\u2014the strong tissues that attach bones to each other\u2014are not fully formed, even a gentle force on the joint may cause it to shift, or partially dislocate. The annular ligament surrounds the radius and may be particularly loose in some young children, which may lead to the nursemaid's elbow recurring over and over again.

Draftsman's elbow Draftsman's elbow or olecranon bursitis, This condition affects the small fluid sacs or bursae in the elbow. These fluid sacs aid in the movement of the elbow. Leaning on the elbow for a long time, a sharp blow, or an infection could be the cause of this condition. Option: C. Impingement syndrome Shoulder impingement syndrome is the result of a vicious cycle of rubbing of the rotator cuff between your humerus and top outer edge of your shoulder. The rubbing leads to more swelling and further narrowing of the space, which result in pain and irritation. Option:D. Painful arc syndrome Painful arc is a syndrome characterized by severe pain in the shoulders; it is commonly known as Shoulder Impingement Syndrome. Symptoms usually occur when the arms are raised overhead or above shoulder level, or when the arm is moved from sideways to the body. Commonly involves supraspinatus tendon.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In most cases of a nursemaid's elbow, the doctor will gently move the bones back into normal position. The medical term for this procedure is \"reduction.\" The doctor will hold the child's wrist or forearm and turn the hand so that it faces palm up. While putting pressure near the top of the radius bone with his or her thumb, the doctor will slowly bend the elbow. A faint pop or click may be heard when the joint goes back into place.</p>\n<p></p>",
