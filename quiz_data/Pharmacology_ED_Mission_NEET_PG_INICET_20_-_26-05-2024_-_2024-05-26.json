Is the same as bioavailability:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Is the same as bioavailability:</li><li>\u2022 This statement is incorrect. Bioavailability refers to the fraction of an administered dose of a drug that reaches the systemic circulation in its active form . In contrast, plasma half-life is the time required for the concentration of the drug in the plasma to reduce to half its original value. These are distinct pharmacokinetic properties.</li><li>\u2022 Bioavailability</li><li>\u2022 fraction of an administered dose</li><li>\u2022 drug that reaches the systemic circulation</li><li>\u2022 active form</li><li>\u2022 Option B. It is directly proportional to clearance:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. It is directly proportional to clearance:</li><li>\u2022 This is incorrect. Plasma half-life is inversely related to clearance . Clearance is the rate at which a drug is removed from the body. If a drug is cleared quickly from the body (high clearance), its plasma half-life will be shorter, and vice versa.</li><li>\u2022 Plasma half-life is inversely related to clearance</li><li>\u2022 Option C. It is inversely proportional to volume of distribution:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. It is inversely proportional to volume of distribution:</li><li>\u2022 This statement is actually a misunderstanding. Plasma half-life is not solely dependent on the volume of distribution . The relationship between half-life, volume of distribution, and clearance is given by the formula: half-life = (0.693 \u00d7 volume of distribution) / clearance. Thus, half-life is directly proportional to the volume of distribution and inversely proportional to clearance.</li><li>\u2022 Plasma half-life is not solely dependent on the volume of distribution</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective</li><li>\u27a4 For drugs eliminated via first-order kinetics , the plasma half-life remains constant because a fixed percentage of the drug is metabolized per unit time , regardless of the drug's concentration in the plasma.</li><li>\u27a4 drugs eliminated via first-order kinetics</li><li>\u27a4 plasma half-life remains constant</li><li>\u27a4 fixed percentage of the drug</li><li>\u27a4 metabolized per unit time</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Nicotinic actions of acetylcholine</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Nicotinic actions of acetylcholine</li><li>\u2022 This is not the correct answer . The nicotinic actions of acetylcholine refer to the effect acetylcholine has on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels found in the nervous system and at the neuromuscular junction . Normally acetylcholine decreases blood pressure and heart rate due to its action of muscarinic receptors. However, if we give very high dose of acetylcholine after giving atropine (to block muscarinic receptors), then it shows increase in BP and heart rate .

A biphasic response to adrenaline would involve an initial phase in which there is increase in blood pressure (due to stimulation of alpha 1 receptors) followed by a second phase in which there is fall in blood pressure (due to action on beta 2 receptors).

However, it also blocks D4 receptors, muscarinic receptors, alpha receptors and H1 receptors. It suppresses both positive as well as negative symptoms of schizophrenia . It is the first FDA approved drug for anti-suicide indication. It is used only as a reserve drug due to the risk of precipitation of seizures ( even in non-epileptics ) and agranulocytosis. Convulsions are dose-dependent adverse effects seen only at higher doses whereas agranulocytosis is independent of dose. Clozapine should be started at low doses (12.5 mg) and gradually dose should be increased. Baseline WBC counts should be measured, and then weekly counts should be done at least for the first 6 months . When WBC count becomes less than 3000/mm3 or absolute neutrophil count becomes less than 1500/mm3, Clozapine should be discontinued. After discontinuation, weekly WBC counts should be measured for an additional 4 weeks. It should not be used with Carbamazepine due to two reasons: Carbamazepine induces its metabolism and thus decreases plasma concentration. Carbamazepine has bone marrow suppressant action and can add to agranulocytosis caused by Clozapine .</li><li>\u2022 Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug that has high potency to block 5HT2 receptors as compared to D2 receptors.
