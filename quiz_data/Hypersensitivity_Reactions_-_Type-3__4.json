      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>It is an immune complex-mediated type 3 vasculitis</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP): From the given data and image diagnosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura is most likely. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) (also known as IgA vasculitis ) is a disorder that causes the inflammation of small blood vessels in the skin, joints, intestines, and kidneys . The most characteristic feature of this form of vasculitis is a purplish rash, typically on the lower legs and buttocks . Henoch-Schonlein purpura can also cause abdominal pain and arthralgia . Renal manifestations occur in one-third of patients and include gross or microscopic hematuria, nephritic syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, or some combination of these . A small number of patients, mostly adults, develop a rapidly progressive form of glomerulonephritis with many crescents (RPGN) . Thrombocytosis is seen (increase in platelet count). Treatment: Steroids</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. These purpura are due to thrombocytopenia. False, HSP doesn\u2019t show thrombocytopenia . Option: C. Diagnosis is Kawasaki vasculitis. False, the diagnosis is HSP . Option: D. All are true. False .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Kawasaki vasculitis: Kawasaki disease is a disease of unknown etiology that most frequently affects infants and children under 5 years of age . Inflammation occurs in medium-sized muscular arteries throughout the body including the coronary artery . It typically presents with conjunctival and oral erythema and blistering, edema of the hands and feet, erythema of the palms and soles, a desquamative rash, and cervical lymph node enlargement (hence its other name, mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome ). Treatment: i/v Ig and Aspirin. NEVER Steroids .</p>\n<p></p>",
