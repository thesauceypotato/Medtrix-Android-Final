      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>It disappears spontaneously within 2-3 weeks In the given question, the likely condition the newborn is having is caput succedaneum . It occurs due to the stagnation of fluid in the layer of the scalp beneath the girdle of contact. It is present at birth and normally resolves spontaneously within 24 hours .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>CEPHALHEMATOMA CAPUT SUCCEDANEUM Soft, fluctuant, localized swelling Localized soft tissue edema with a poorly defined outline Caused by subperiosteal haemorrhage Caused by the pressure of the fetal head against the cervix Appears after birth Present at birth Swelling does not cross suture lines Swelling crosses suture lines Disappears in several weeks to months Disappears within a few hours to days Complications include defective blood clotting, jaundice Complications are rare</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option A. It can cross the suture line as it is present between the scalp layer, unlike cephalhematoma which is present between the periosteum and the bone. Option C. It occurs due to stagnation of fluid due to interference with venous return and lymphatic drainage from an unsupported area of the scalp during the time of descent. MIT usually occurs after the rupture of membranes. Option D. Caput location signifies the position of the head occupied in the pelvis and the degree of flexion achieved. With increasing flexion, the swelling will be placed more posteriorly.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1, 2, 3 In the given image, the marked structure is the anterior fontanelle. It is formed by the joining of the four sutures in the midplane, anteriorly frontal, posteriorly sagittal and on either side coronal. This contributes to it being a diamond shape . The floor is formed by a membrane which becomes ossified 18 months after birth . It becomes pathological, if it fails to ossify even after 24 months.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>As it remains membranous long after birth, it helps in accommodating marked brain growth. Collection of blood and exchange transfusion can be performed through it via the superior longitudinal sinus. CSF can be drawn although rarely through the angle of the anterior fontanel from the lateral ventricle. Option 1: Its palpation on internal examination denotes the degree of flexion of the head. Option 2: Facilitates the moulding of the head. Option 3: Through this, we can also do fetal scalp ph monitoring. Option 4: In cases of dehydration, on palpation the floor is depressed and in intracranial tension, the floor is elevated.</p>\n<p></p>",
