      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pharmacological blockade Pharmacologic dilation of the pupil is one of the myriad explanations for unilateral or bilateral pupillary dilation. It is typically characterised by poor or no pupillary constriction to light or near stimuli. Clinical differentiation from similar appearing life-threatening pathologies, most notably compressive lesions of cranial nerve III , is vital.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Most commonly, the medications, drugs, and toxins that cause pupillary dilation act via iris parasympathetic receptor blockade (anticholinergic mydriasis), but sympathetic stimulation (e.g., topical epinephrine) can also produce lesser degrees of pharmacologic mydriasis (without impairing the light/near reaction).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Papillitis Papillitis may represent optic neuritis , often associated with developing or coexistent multiple sclerosis (MS). In contrast to the symptoms and signs of papilledema, optic neuritis is typically acute in onset and is associated with retrobulbar pain that is worse with eye movement; it is not accompanied by headache. Transient visual obscurations are not typical. Optic neuritis is commonly retrobulbar (behind the globe), and the optic nerve is entirely normal in appearance.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>In addition, spontaneous venous pulsations are present, the veins are of normal appearance , and hemorrhages and exudates are absent .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
