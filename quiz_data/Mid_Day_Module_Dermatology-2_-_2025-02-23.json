Liquid nitrogen, carbon dioxide snow, and dimethyl ether can all cause thermal injury to the skin. The coldest freeze is produced by liquid nitrogen , which is frequently employed in practice. A cotton wool bud or a cryospray is used to apply it until a rim of iced tissue forms around the wart (visible as a white discoloration). Depending on the size and location of the wart, the freezing is maintained for 5 to 30 seconds. With freezing times under 30 seconds, scarring is unlikely.

She reports that the lesions began as small blisters that broke easily, leaving behind crusted, scaly areas and shallow erosions. She denies any mucosal involvement or recent illnesses. She is otherwise healthy and takes no regular medications. On physical examination, you note several superficial erosions with crusts on the scalp and chest. There are no intact blisters, and no lesions are found in the oral cavity. A skin biopsy is taken from the edge of an eroded lesion on the chest. Based on the clinical presentation, what will most likely be observed in the histopathology of the skin biopsy?",
