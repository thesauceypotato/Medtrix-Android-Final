Polymyxins B and E (also known as colistin) are used in the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections. They work mostly by breaking up the bacterial cell membrane. They are part of a broader class of molecules called nonribosomal peptides. Option: B . Colistin, also known as polymyxin E, is an antibiotic medication used as a last-resort treatment for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections including pneumonia. These may involve bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Acinetobacter. Option: D . Quinupristin is a streptogramin B antibiotic, used in combination with dalfopristin under the trade name Synercid. It has activity against Gram-positive and atypical bacteria but not Gram-negative bacteria. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis.</p>\n<p></p>",
