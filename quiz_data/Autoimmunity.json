The sperm antigen is therefore not recognised as self, and when it enters circulation, it is immunogenic. This is believed to explain the pathogenesis of orchitis following mumps. The\u00b7 Virus damages the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules, leading to leakage of sperms and initiation of an immune response, resulting in orchitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Antigenic alterations. Cells or tissues may undergo antigenic alterations due to physical, chemical and biological influences. Such altered or 'neoantigens' may elicit an immune response. Option C. Cross-reacting foreign antigens: The fortuitous similarity between some foreign and self-antigens is the basis of the 'cross-reacting antigen' theory of autoimmunity. Organ-specific antigens are present in several species. Injection of heterologous organ-specific antigens may induce an immune response, damaging the particular organ or tissue in the host. Option D. Molecular mimicry is due to some infecting microorganisms and self-antigen of epitopes with identical peptide sequences (instead of similarities in 'cross-reactions'). Examples of such homologous sequences are seen in arthritogenic Shigella flexneri and HLA-B27, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and joint membranes, Coxsackie B and myocardium</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Sequestered antigens are not physiologically in contact with IS cells.

Serologically, two groups of autoimmune anaemias can be distinguished, characterised by 'cold' and 'warm' antibodies, respectively. The cold autoantibodies are, generally, complete agglutinating antibodies belonging to the IgM class (OPTION A) and agglutinate erythrocytes at four \u00b0C but not at three 7\u00b0C. (OPTION B) This condition, which used to accompany syphilitic infection frequently, is seldom seen nowadays. Cold agglutinins are also seen in primary atypical pneumonia (OPTION D), trypanosomiasis and black water fever. (OPTION C) Warm autoantibodies are generally incomplete, non-agglutinating antibodies usually belonging to the IgG class and frequently seen in patients taking certain drugs such as sulphonamides, antibiotics and alpha methyl dopa. In autoimmune anaemias, the red cells coated with antibodies are prematurely destroyed in the spleen and liver. Complement-dependent intravascular hemolysis appears to be a rare event.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a decompensated acquired hemolysis caused by the host's immune system acting against its own red cell antigens.

Myasthenia gravis: In this disease, muscles are tired due to malfunction of the myoneural junction. An antibody against the acetyl choline receptor on my oneural junctions of striated muscles is present in these patients. (OPTION B) This prevents acetyl choline from combining with its receptor, and impairs muscular contraction. The thymus shows lymphoid hyperplasia and numerous germinal centres. (OPTION C) Infants born to affected mothers show symptoms of the disease but recover spontaneously by the age of two months, coinciding with the disappearance of maternal antibodies.
