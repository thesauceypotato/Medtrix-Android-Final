They are chemically inert and almost indestructible, resistant to strong acids. During drowning, diatoms (size up to 60 \u03bc) enter the circulation via the lungs through the ruptured alveolar walls, lymph channels and pulmonary veins into the left heart and then into general circulation, when the person is alive. The presence of diatoms in the lung substance, blood stream, brain, liver, kidneys , sternum, bone marrow of femur (best site for analysis) or humerus or in the skeletal muscle has been claimed to be suggestive proof of antemortem drowning. Since diatoms resist putrefaction, diatom tests may have some value in examination of decomposed bodies. The test is negative in dead bodies thrown in water and in dry drowning. A water sample is collected at the time of body retrieval in a clean container and similarity of different species of diatom is compared. Interpretation - The presence of diatoms supports the diagnosis of drowning, while the absence of diatoms does not exclude it as a cause.

The casualty medical officer notes that the patient has no pulse and is pronounced dead on arrival. The forensic expert conducts an autopsy and observes an oblique ligature mark located above the level of the thyroid cartilage. The subcutaneous tissue underneath the ligature mark appears white and glistening. No other signs of struggle or trauma are present on the body.
