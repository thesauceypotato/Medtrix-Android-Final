Tamsulosin is a selective \u03b1 1 antagonist frequently used to counteract bladder obstruction due to prostatic hyperplasia. Fatigue, sleepiness, and dizziness are common adverse effects as seen in this patient most likely related to the drug-induced hypotension , palpitations are infrequently reported and are most likely related to th e reflex tachycardia triggered by the drug-induced vasodilation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Benign Hypertrophy of the Prostate (BHP) - The urinary obstruction caused by BHP has a static component due to the increased size of the prostate and a dynamic component due to the increased tone of the bladder neck/prostate smooth muscle. Two classes of drugs are available: \u03b11 adrenergic blockers (prazosin-like) : they decrease the tone of prostatic/bladder neck muscles . 5-\u03b1reductase inhibitor (finasteride/dutasteride) which arrests growth/reduces the size of the prostate Activation of \u03b11 adrenoceptors in bladder trigone , prostate, and prostatic urethra increases smooth muscle tone , their blockade relaxes these structures, reducing dynamic obstruction , increasing urinary flow rate, and causing more complete emptying of the bladder in many patients of BHP. Voiding symptoms (hesitancy, narrowing of stream, dribbling, and increased residual urine) are relieved better than irritative symptoms like urgency, frequency, and nocturia. The \u03b11 blockers afford faster (within 2 weeks) and greater symptomatic relief than finasteride which primarily affects the static component of obstruction and has a delayed onset taking nearly six months for clinical improvement. The \u03b11 blockers do not affect prostate size but are more commonly used . However, the effects last only till the drug is given. Even with continued therapy, benefits may decline after a few years due to disease progression. They may be used concurrently with finasteride. Terazosin, doxazosin, alfuzosin, and tamsulosin are the preferred \u03b11 blockers because of once-daily dosing. There is some evidence that terazosin and doxazosin promote apoptosis in the prostate. Tamsulosin appears to cause fewer vascular side effects because of relative \u03b11A/\u03b11D selectivity.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options: A and C.
