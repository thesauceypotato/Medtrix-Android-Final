Unicameral bone cysts are most common in the proximal humerus and femur. The lesions are most active during skeletal growth and usually heal spontaneously at maturity. Unicameral bone cysts are often asymptomatic , unless a pathological fracture has occurred. Plain radiographs reveal a centrally located, purely lytic lesion with a well-marginated outline. Occasionally (20%), a thinned cortical fragment fractures and falls into the base of the lesion confirming its empty cystic nature. This \u201cfallen fragment\u201d sign is pathognomonic of a unicameral bone cyst, bone fragment, may also hinge around and move with fluid called as trap door sign.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Adamantinoma. Adamantinomas are rare, low-grade malignant bone tumors that predominately affect the diaphyses and metaphyses of the tibia . The tumor is called adamantinoma due to its histological similarity to ameloblastoma, often found in the mandible. Histopathologically, adamantinoma displays biphasic patterns consisting of epithelial cells and osteofibrous components. On x-ray, it appears as a well-circumscribed, cortical tumor with a multilobulated, osteolytic pattern. Intralesional opacities, septation, and peripheral sclerosis may also be seen. These multifocal radiolucencies, surrounded by ring-shaped densities, produce the characteristic ''soap-bubble'' appearance . The lesion is typically confined within the intracortical region and extends longitudinally along the bone. However, in some cases, it can result in cortical destruction and invade the medullary cavity or adjacent periosteum and soft tissues. In such cases, a lamellar or solid periosteal reaction is typically associated with the lesion.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

Ewing\u2019s sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma is the second most common (after osteosarcoma) in patients younger than 30 years of age. Classically, Ewing sarcoma appears radiographically as a destructive lesion in the diaphysis of a long bone with an \u201c onion skin\u201d periosteal reaction . In reality, Ewing sarcoma more often originates in the metaphysis of a long bone, but frequently extends for a considerable distance into the diaphysis.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

It peaks between 40 and 60 years for primary chondrosarcoma and between 25 and 45 years for secondary chondrosarcoma. Chondrosarcoma can occur in any location; however, most are located in a proximal location such as the pelvis (most common site) , proximal femur, and proximal humerus. Although chondrosarcomas rarely occur in the hand, they are the most common malignant tumor of bone in this location. The radiographic appearance of chondrosarcoma lesion arising in the medullary cavity with irregular matrix calcification. The pattern of calcification has been described as \u201c punctate \u201d, \u201c popcorn \u201d, or \u201c comma-shaped \u201d.

Osteogenic sarcoma. Osteosarcoma is a tumor characterized by the production of osteoid matrix by malignant cells. It is the second most common primary malignancy of bone behind multiple myeloma. Onset can occur at any age; however, primary osteosarcoma occurs most commonly in the second decade of life. All skeletal locations can be affected; however, most primary osteosarcomas occur at the sites of the most rapid bone growth, including the distal femur, the proximal tibia, and the proximal humerus. Typical radiographic appearances include medullary and cortical bone destruction, permeative or moth-eaten appearance, aggressive periosteal reaction, sunburst appearance, Codman triangle.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

Osteoid sarcoma . Osteoid osteoma accounts for 10% of all benign bone tumors. It is neither locally aggressive nor does it have the potential for malignant transformation. This bone tumor frequently affects the long bones of the femur and tibia . It presents with a nidus of vascular osteoid with surrounding sclerotic bone. Osteoid osteomas in long bones are predominantly intracortical. Plain radiograph may be normal or may show a s olid periosteal reaction with cortical thickening. The nidus is sometimes visible as a well-circumscribed lucent region, occasionally with a central sclerotic dot. However, dense sclerosis may sometimes obscure the nidus.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

The radiographic appearance of chondrosarcoma shows a lesion arising in the medullary cavity with irregular matrix calcification. The pattern of calcification is described as \u201c punctate \u201d, \u201c popcorn \u201d, or \u201c comma-shaped \u201d. There is bone destruction, cortical erosions, and periosteal reaction.
