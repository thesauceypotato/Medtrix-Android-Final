      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Photoretinitis Solar retinopathy (photic retinopathy, foveomacular retinitis, solar retinitis, and eclipse retinopathy) refers to photochemical toxicity and resultant injury to retinal tissues, usually occurring at the fovea. This entity is commonly associated with sun-gazing or eclipse viewing and often results in mild-to-moderate visual acuity deficit and/or central or paracentral scotoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Recovery is spontaneous and occurs over 3-6 months after the inciting event. However, visual recovery may be incomplete, and patients may suffer from permanent visual acuity deficits and central or paracentral scotoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Malingering - after ruling out any organic cause. Option: B. Photophthalmia - Photophthalmia is produced due to exposure to short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV) rays (especially in the wavelength range of 311- 290 nanometers). The cornea absorbs ultraviolet radiation. This may be associated with. Exposure of the naked eye to arc light: This may be seen in cases exposed to industrial welding. Option: D. Light-induced maculopathy - Photochemical retinal damage can result from the light of the operating microscope during cataract extraction with the implantation of intraocular lenses.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>TREATMENT : No effective treatment is available; measures should be taken to prevent it. Eclipse viewing should be discouraged unless there is proper use of protective eyewear filters which absorb UV and IR  rays.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>As early as feasible It is usually associated with disease processes in the retina , which involve the retina becoming starved of oxygen (ischaemic). The ischemic retina releases various factors, the most important of which is VEGF. These factors stimulate the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) . Unfortunately, these new vessels do not have the same characteristics as the blood vessels originally formed in the eye. In addition, new blood vessels can form in areas that do not have them.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Specifically, new blood vessels can be observed on the iris. In addition to the blood vessels in the iris, they can grow into the angle of the eye. These blood vessels eventually go through a process called fibrosis which closes the normal physiologic anatomy of the angle.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B.

Examination shows cervical lymphadenopathy. There are multiple violaceous plaques seen over his trunk and extremities.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis is an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related opportunistic infection that can lead to blindness. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis is an important ocular AIDS-associated A full-thickness retinal infection can lead to necrosis and retinal breaks and detachments. It is a viral retinitis that can also be seen in immunosuppressed patients for other reasons besides AIDS.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Fundoscopic findings in CMV retinitis are described as a \"pizza pie\" appearance because of a distinct mixture of red and white lesions. The red spots are retinal hemorrhages. The white spots are fluffy/granular perivascular white opacities around retinal vessels and resemble cotton wool spots . Vision is typically unaffected initially, but vision loss may occur if the retina detaches or the optic nerve or macula is affected.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A .HIV retinopathy is a microvascular disorder of the retina that occurs in about 60% of patients with AIDS. It classically presents with cotton-wool spots, retinal hemorrhages, and microaneurysms. The patient's perivascular yellow-white opacities could be confused with cotton-wool spots. The key differences are that cotton-wool spots are smaller in size and tend to resolve on their own without progression. Vision is typically unaffected in HIV retinopathy , which helps to distinguish it from other causes of eye disease in HIV-positive patients. The \"black spots\" this patient saw also suggest a different diagnosis. Option: B .Toxoplasmosis is an opportunistic infection found when CD4 counts are below 100. On examination, yellow-white opacities are observed in the patient, which may be mistaken for toxoplasma retinitis. However, these patients are perivascular (meaning around the retinal vessels), while toxoplasma lesions are nonvascular (meaning their distribution is unrelated to the vessels). Additionally, patients with toxoplasma retinitis present with eye pain and decreased visual acuity. Option: D . Diagnosis of herpes simplex keratitis is based on a clinical history of infection with herpes simplex virus and slit lamp findings showing dendritic cornea lesions . Symptoms include pain, blurry vision, and eye-watering, which are absent in this patient. Moreover, the retina is unaffected and fundoscopic findings are normal in herpes simplex keratitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurs in approximately one-third of patients, and the presence of concurrent keratic precipitates in a stellate fashion can also suggest CMV uveitis.</p>\n<p></p>",
