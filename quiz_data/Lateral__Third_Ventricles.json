It is a small diverticulum, which extends posteriorly between the superior and inferior laminae of the stalk of the pineal gland.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option:A . Optic Chiasma Option:B. Pituitary infundibulum Tuber cinereum Optic chiasma, pituitary infundibulum and tuber cinereum form the floor of the third ventricle.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The third ventricle is a median cleft between the two thalami. Developmentally, it represents the cavity of the diencephalon, except for the area in front of the interventricular foramen which is derived from the median part of the telencephalon. The cavity is lined by ependyma.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The marked elevation is known as calcar avis and is formed by calcarine sulcus. The marked structure is known as calcar avis which is formed by calcarine sulcus. It is formed on the posterior horn which is present in the occipital lobe as given in the image. Hence, the correct answer to this question is option C.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The lateral ventricles are the two largest ventricles of the brain and contain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Each cerebral hemisphere contains a lateral ventricle, known as the left or right lateral ventricle, respectively. Each lateral ventricle resembles a C-shaped cavity that begins at an inferior horn in the temporal lobe, travels through a body in the parietal lobe and frontal lobe, and ultimately terminates at the interventricular foramina where each lateral ventricle connects to the single, central third ventricle. Along the path, a posterior horn extends backwards into the occipital lobe, and an anterior horn extends farther into the frontal lobe.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option:A. The marked elevation is known as calcar avis and is formed by the collateral sulcus. The marked structure is known as calcar avis which is formed by calcarine sulcus. It is formed on the posterior horn which is present in the occipital lobe as given in the image. Option:B. The marked elevation is backward collateral eminence formed by the collateral sulcus. Collateral eminence is formed on the inferior horn by a collateral sulcus. Option:D. The marked elevation is known as collateral eminence and is formed by the calcarine sulcus. Collateral eminence is formed on the inferior horn by the collateral sulcus.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Tumours in the lower part of the third ventricle give rise to hypothalamic symptoms, like diabetes insipidus, obesity, sexual disturbance, disturbance of sleep, hyperglycemia and glycosuria.</p>\n<p></p>",
