      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Anticipation</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Huntington's Disease is an autosomal dominant disease caused by the degeneration of striatal neurons and characterised by a progressive movement disorder and dementia . Jerky, hyperkinetic, sometimes dystonic movements involving all parts of the body (chorea) are characteristic; affected individuals may later develop bradykinesia and rigidity. It is a prototypic polyglutamine trinucleotide repeat expansion disease with CAG repeats that encode a polyglutamine region. Normal genes contain 6 to 35 copies of the repeat; when the number of repetitions is increased beyond this level , it is associated with the disease . There is an inverse relationship between repeat number and age of onset, such that longer repeats tend to be associated with earlier onset . The brain is small and shows striking atrophy of the caudate nucleus and the putamen , components of the dorsal striatum; the globus pallidus may atrophy secondarily, and the lateral and third ventricles are dilated.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Increased penetrance. The transmission of an abnormal gene from parent to child does not always cause disease; the likelihood that the properties of a gene will be expressed is called penetrance . Huntington's disease is a disorder with 100% penetrance means all individuals who have an abnormal HD gene will develop Huntington's disease . Option: B. Pleiotropy. Sometimes one gene mutation leads to multiple phenotypic abnormalities. This genetic phenomenon is called pleiotropy . In Huntington's disease, pleiotropy is present because the mutation of one gene causes dysfunction of behaviour movement and cognition altogether . Option: D. Mosaicism. The presence of two populations of cells with different genotypes in one patient is known as mosaicism . Examples include milder forms of Turner, Klinefelter and Down syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Anticipation : This refers to the observation that clinical features of Huntington Disease worsen with each successive generation as if the mutation becomes increasingly deleterious as it is transmitted from a man to his sons and grandsons. Anticipation is seen with trinucleotide repeat disorders, as in Fragile X syndrome, Myotonic Dystrophy and Friedrich Ataxia.</p>\n<p></p>",

Each mitochondrion contains thousands of copies of mtDNA, and typically, deleterious mtDNA mutations affect some but not all of these copies. Thus, tissues and individuals may harbour both wild-type and mutant mtDNA, a heteroplasmy situation. Mitochondria and their contained DNA are randomly distributed to the daughter cells during cell division. Thus, when a cell containing normal and mutant mtDNA divides, the proportion of the normal and mutant mtDNA in daughter cells is highly variable. Therefore, the expression of disorders resulting from mutations in mtDNA is quite variable . Diseases associated with mitochondrial inheritance are rare, and many of them affect the neuromuscular system. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is a prototype of this type of disorder.

It occurs once in 1550 live births for women under age 20, in contrast to 1 in 25 live births for mothers older than 45.
