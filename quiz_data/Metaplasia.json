Pressure atrophy: Tumor compressing surrounding tissue .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Telomerase. Incorrect because increased telomerase expression is believed to result in cancer but this does not play a role in cachexia . Option: C. Thymidylate synthase. Incorrect because thymidylate synthase is an enzyme which plays a role in thymidine synthesis for DNA synthesis but it does not play any role in atrophy. Option: D. TNF alpha. Incorrect because though, TNF alpha plays a role in cachexia but TNF alpha is a cytokine and not an enzyme .</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Metaplasia Cystitis glandularis and cystitis cystica: These are common lesions of the urinary bladder in which nests of the urothelium (von Brunn nests) grow downward into the lamina propria . Here, epithelial cells in the centre of the nest undergo metaplasia and take on a cuboidal or columnar appearance ( cystitis glandularis ) or retract to produce cystic spaces lined by flattened urothelium ( cystitis cystica ). Because the two processes often coexist , the condition is typically referred to as cystitis cystica et glandularis . In a variant of cystitis, glandularis goblet cells are present, and the epithelium resembles intestinal mucosa (intestinal or colonic metaplasia). Both variants can arise in the setting of inflammation and metaplasia . Extensive and multifocal intestinal metaplasia is a precursor to adenocarcinoma .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hypertrophy refers to an increase in cell size Hyperplasia refers to an increase in cell number Metaplasia refers to a Change in the phenotype of a cell Atrophy refers to a reduction in the size of an organ or tissue Anaplasia refers to a lack of differentiation Dysplasia is characterized by the loss in the uniformity of the individual cells and their architectural orientation</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B.

Dysplastic cells may exhibit considerable pleomorphism and often contain large hyperchromatic nuclei with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio . Option: D. Neoplasia means new growth .
