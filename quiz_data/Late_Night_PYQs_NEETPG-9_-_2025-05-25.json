Sodium valproate is considered the drug of choice for this condition due to its broad spectrum antiepileptic properties and effectiveness in controlling both partial and generalized seizures. It works by increasing brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter.</li><li>\u2022 Benign Rolandic Epilepsy typically presents with focal seizures involving the face, particularly during sleep, and has a characteristic EEG pattern with centrotemporal spikes.

Pleomorphic adenoma</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The case scenario and image showing a swelling lifting the ear lobe are suggestive of a pleomorphic adenoma. Pleomorphic adenomas are the most common benign tumors of the salivary glands, with the parotid gland being the most frequent site. These tumors are encapsulated and exhibit a mixed cellular composition, leading to a variable consistency, which is reflected in their name \"pleomorphic.\" Clinically, they present as painless, slow-growing masses. The characteristic lift of the earlobe due to the swelling is a classic sign of a parotid gland tumor. Untreated pleomorphic adenomas may undergo malignant transformation, hence surgical excision is typically recommended.</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Jaw Tumor: Jaw tumors, particularly those of the mandible or maxilla, are often bony growths or related to the teeth (odontogenic tumors). While they can cause facial asymmetry, they are usually centered around the bones and are not typically located in the parotid gland region. These tumors tend to be hard and lack the variable consistency described in the clinical presentation.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Jaw Tumor:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Dermoid cyst: Dermoid cysts are benign cystic tumors containing skin appendages (such as hair follicles), and sometimes hair, teeth, or sebum. They are typically congenital and found on the face, neck, or ovary. While they can appear on the face or neck, the described clinical presentation is less suggestive of a dermoid cyst compared to a pleomorphic adenoma. Dermoid cysts often show indentation due to putty material.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Dermoid cyst:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Sebaceous cyst: Also known as an epidermal cyst, a sebaceous cyst is a benign growth arising from blocked sebaceous glands, often containing a thick, cheese-like material. Sebaceous cysts can appear almost anywhere on the body where sebaceous glands are found, including the face, and often show a black punctum. However, the described clinical presentation and duration better match a pleomorphic adenoma.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

D) DIEP is a myocutaneous flap</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) flap is a type of breast reconstruction flap that is derived from the deep inferior epigastric artery. The DIEP flap is a muscle-sparing flap, meaning it involves only the removal of skin, fat, and blood vessels (perforators), without taking any of the rectus abdominis muscle. This reduces the risk of post-operative abdominal weakness and complications, unlike the Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous (TRAM) flap, which includes muscle. Therefore, it is incorrect to refer to the DIEP flap as a myocutaneous flap because it does not include muscle.</li><li>\u2022 DIEP is a myocutaneous flap: This statement is false. A myocutaneous flap includes muscle tissue, whereas the DIEP flap spares the rectus abdominis muscle, utilizing only the skin, fat, and perforator vessels.</li><li>\u2022 DIEP is a myocutaneous flap:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Pedicled TRAM based on superior epigastric artery: The pedicled TRAM flap stands for Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap. It relies on the superior epigastric artery for blood supply, which remains attached (pedicled) to its original source. The flap, including the rectus muscle, is tunneled under the skin to the chest to reconstruct the breast. This statement is accurate.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Pedicled TRAM based on superior epigastric artery:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Free TRAM based on inferior epigastric artery: The free TRAM flap involves the removal of a section of the abdominal tissue, including the rectus muscle, along with the inferior epigastric arteries. This flap is transplanted to the chest and connected to the chest's blood vessels using microsurgical techniques. This flap utilizes both the superior and inferior epigastric arteries. This statement is accurate.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Free TRAM based on inferior epigastric artery:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. DIEP based on deep inferior epigastric artery: The DIEP flap is similar to the free TRAM flap but does not involve the removal of the rectus muscle. Instead, it uses only the skin, fat, and perforator blood vessels based on the deep inferior epigastric artery. This design spares the abdominal muscles, reducing post-operative complications. This statement is accurate.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. DIEP based on deep inferior epigastric artery:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The DIEP flap is a muscle-sparing flap used in breast reconstruction, involving the skin, fat, and blood vessels without including muscle tissue, which differentiates it from a myocutaneous flap like the TRAM flap.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
