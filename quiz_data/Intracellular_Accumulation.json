Sphingomyelin is a ubiquitous component of cellular (including organellar) membranes, and so the enzyme deficiency blocks the degradation of the lipid, resulting in its progressive accumulation within lysosomes . Affected cells become enlarged, due to the distention of lysosomes with sphingomyelin and cholesterol. Innumerable small vacuoles of relatively uniform size are created. Electron microscopy shows that the vacuoles are engorged secondary lysosomes that contain membranous cytoplasmic bodies resembling concentric lamellated myelin figures, sometimes called zebra bodies. Niemann-Pick disease in liver. The hepatocytes and Kupffer cells have a foamy, vacuolated appearance due to deposition of lipids.
