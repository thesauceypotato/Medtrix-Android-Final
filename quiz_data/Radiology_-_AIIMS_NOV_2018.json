      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Cervical rib Cervical ribs are supernumerary or accessory ribs arising from the seventh cervical vertebra. These occur in 1\u20132% of the population and are commonly bilateral, though often asymmetrical. More commonly seen in females. These can cause thoracic outlet syndrome by compression of the brachial plexus or subclavian vessels.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>A cervical rib is an extra rib that forms above the first rib, growing from the base of the neck just above the collarbone. You can have a cervical rib on the right, left, or on both sides</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B. Spondylolisthesis ;Spondylolisthesis is a spinal condition that causes lower back pain. It occurs when one of your vertebrae, the bones of your spine, slips out of place onto the vertebra below it. Option C. Fracture left 2nd rib Option D. Costochondritis ;Costochondritis is a benign cause of chest wall pain that results from inflammation of the costal cartilage, the cartilage that connect the ribs to the sternum</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Symptoms include pain, tingling or weakness in the shoulder and arm, especially when raising the arms. Having a cervical rib (an extra rib extending from the neck) increases your chance of developing thoracic outlet syndrome. Different types of thoracic outlet syndrome call for different treatments.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Discitis ; Discitis is a serious but uncommon medical diagnosis. It is an infection of the intervertebral disc space. The role of the intervertebral discs is to separate and cushion the spinal segments from each other. An infection, and thus inflammation of these discs can cause much pain and discomfort Option C. Vertebral osteomyelitis ; Vertebral osteomyelitis is the most common form of vertebral infection. It can develop from direct open spinal trauma, infections in surrounding areas and from bacteria that spreads to a vertebra from the blood. Intervertebral disc space infections involve the space between adjacent vertebrae Option D. Tethered cord syndrome ;Tethered spinal cord syndrome is a neurologic disorder caused by tissue attachments that limit the movement of the spinal cord within the spinal column. These attachments cause an abnormal stretching of the spinal cord. This syndrome is closely associated with spina bifida.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Arachnoiditis is a disorder caused by the inflammation of the arachnoid.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pneumoperitoneum The X-ray of the chest is showing multiple small bowel perforations. So it is the case of pneumoperitoneum. Free air in the abdomen in adults is usually a result of perforation\u2014either from peptic ulcer or from intestinal perforation.

It can be differentiated from a diaphragmatic hernia in that the continuity of the hemidiaphragm is maintained in eventration. Total eventration: More common on the left side. Focal eventration: More common on the right side. Diaphragmatic hernia Hiatus hernia Herniation of the abdominal contents into the thorax through the esophageal hiatus. Commonly seen on CXR as a lucency/air fluid level superimposed over cardiac shadow. Morgagni hernia It is a persistent development defect in diaphragm anteriorly, between the septum transversum and the right and left costal origins of diaphragm. Seen in adults mostly at the right cardiophrenic angle\u2014due to protective effect of pericardium on the left. Present as a mediastinal mass. Bochdalek hernia It is a persistent development defect in the diaphragm posteriorly, due to failure of pleura peritoneal canal membrane to fuse with dorsal esophageal mesentery medially and body wall laterally. Seen on the left side\u2014due to the protective effect of liver on right side. Emphysema Permanent, abnormal enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by the destruction of their walls without obvious fibrosis. CXR is the initial investigation. HRCT is the investigation of choice. CXR findings: Over inflammation and alteration of lung vessels are most important findings. X-ray of the chest reveals pneumomediastinum (white arrows) and subcutaneous emphysema (black arrows).</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Others Sign in Pneumoperitoneum Cupola sign/ Saddlebag sign/ Mustache sign \u2022  1st radiographic sign described in 1915 \u2022  The under surface of diaphragm (water density) is lined by gas (air density) hence seen as sharp margin Football sign \u2022  In supine position, all the free air rises up and collects in the central abdomen just beneath the anterior abdominal wall\u2014seen as oval central lucency\u2014like an American football Silver sign \u2022  Gas (air density) lines the falciform ligament (water density structure) on either side thus making it clearly visible</p>\n<p></p>",
