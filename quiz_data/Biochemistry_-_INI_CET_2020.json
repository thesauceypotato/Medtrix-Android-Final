Extension/Elongation: Polymerization or synthesis of DNA at 72 \u00b0C by a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme, Taq polymerase The result of one cycle of PCR is two double-stranded sequences of target DNA, each containing one newly made strand and one original strand.

It is calculated simply by difference in initial energy of substrates and final energy of products. So, we have to look for second free energy change which is difference in energy of substrate and transition state ( \u0394G \u2021 ) or also called as free energy of activation. The order for ( \u0394G \u2021 ) is as \u0394G A \u2021 > \u0394G B \u2021 > \u0394G C \u2021 > \u0394G D \u2021 with highest for A and almost zero for D. So, the answer is A.</p>\n<p></p>",
