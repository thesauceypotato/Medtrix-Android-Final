Albumin: It is a protein synthesized by hepatocytes, and its levels can be reduced in conditions such as liver cirrhosis, where there is impaired synthetic function. Option: B .Prothrombin time: It measures the time it takes for the blood to clot and is dependent on the liver's ability to produce clotting factors. Option C .Serum ammonia: It is a test that measures the liver's ability to convert ammonia to urea and eliminate it from the body. High levels of ammonia in the blood can indicate liver dysfunction.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Serum markers in liver pathology A.

All the statements given above are true with respect to Acute liver injury, hence the answer D: All of the above is the correct option.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Acute liver injury Acute liver injury is a sudden and severe deterioration of liver function. It can also be referred to as fulminant hepatic failure. The liver may become small and shrunken due to massive hepatic necrosis. Massive hepatic necrosis is the widespread death of liver cells.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option:A. Also called fulminant hepatic failure: Fulminant hepatic failure is a specific subset of acute liver injury characterized by rapid progression and severe liver dysfunction. Option:B. Liver is small and shrunken: In some cases of acute liver injury, the liver can indeed become small and shrunken. This can occur due to extensive damage and loss of liver cells, leading to liver atrophy. Option:C. Massive hepatic necrosis: It is a hallmark feature of acute liver injury. It refers to widespread death of liver cells, resulting in extensive tissue damage and loss of liver function.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Acute liver injury can lead to the development of coagulopathy and hepatic encephalopathy.</p>\n<p></p>",
