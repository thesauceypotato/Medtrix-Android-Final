      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Spectroscopic test It is the most delicate and reliable test for detecting the presence of blood in both recent and old stains. Less than 0.1 mg. of blood is sufficient. The blood stain is dissolved in water, normal saline or dilutes ammonia, and is placed in a small glass test tube which is then kept between the spectroscope and the source of the light. The extract of the blood must be diluted and if turbid it should be filtered. The solution of the blood has the property of absorbing some of the rays from the spectrum, producing characteristic dark absorption bands, which vary with the type of blood pigment present.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Benzidine Test Cut out a small piece of old stained material or tease out fibres from the stained fabric and place it on porcelain tile. Add a drop of a saturated solution of benzidine in glacial acetic acid, and then a drop of 10 volumes of hydrogen peroxide. If blood is present, a dark blue colour is produced immediately. A positive reaction is given by blood of almost any age, blood that has been exposed to heat or cold, and blood stains treated with cleaning agents. This is the best preliminary test for blood and it detects blood when present in a dilution of one part of blood in three lakhs. A positive reaction is not proof of the presence of blood, but a negative reaction rules out the presence of blood. A weaker reaction is obtained from certain other substances, e.g. pus, saliva, milk, rust, formalin, certain vegetable and animal juices, oxidising agents, bacteria, etc. Option: B. Haemochromogen Crystal Test (Takayama tes t ) Place a small piece of suspected material on a glass slide and add 2 to 3 drops of Takayama reagent (sodium hydroxide, pyridine. glucose), and cover with a coverslip. Pink feathery crystals of haemo chromogen or reduced alkaline haematin arranged in clusters, sheaves, etc., appear in one to six minutes. Slight warming of the slide hastens the reaction. The result is negative if crystals are not formed in 30 minutes. The test gives good results even with old stains. It is delicate and more reliable. Option: C. Haemin Crystal Test (Teichmann's test) A small crystal of sodium chloride and two to three drops of glacial acetic acid are placed on a small piece of the suspected stain on a glass slide. A coverslip is applied and. the acid is evaporated by heating over a small flame. It is examined under the microscope after cooling. Faint yellowish-red to brownish-black rhombic crystals of haemin or haematin chloride arranged single or in clusters are seen if blood is present. Bubbles of gas are given by haematin crystals, with the addition of a drop of hydrogen peroxide. The reaction is negative if the stain is old, is washed or treated by chemicals, presence of too much salt, moisture in acid and overheating.</p>\n<p></p>",

If blood is present, a pink or purple colour develops immediately. The test is more specific for blood than the benzidine test but comparatively less sensitive. Traces of copper give a positive reaction. The tests employing guaiacum (deep blue) and leucomalachite green are rarely used in medico-legal work.</p>\n<p></p>",

A blood group antigen cannot appear in a child, unless present in one or another reaction. If an individual is homozygous for a blood group factor, it must appear in the blood of all his children. If a child is homozygous for a blood group factor, the gene for the same must have been inherited by it from each of its parents.

Blood grouping :- The application of blood groupings to medicolegal problems is based on the following principles. Option: B. HLA Typing :- The Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) System consists of protein substances on the surface of a wide variety of tissues and organs, on tumours, white cells ASD platelets. The presently known seven multiple loci with about 125 multiple allelism, and with a very high degree of polymorphism, provide a very good discriminating capacity. Option: D. DNA fingerprinting (DNA typing, DNA identification, or genetic typing) is a technique involving chemically dividing the DNA into fragments which form a unique pattern and then matching that \"identity profile\" with the pattern obtained from similarly testing a suspect's blood specimen. If the two patterns match, the possibility of error, i.e. the chance that they do not belong to the same individual may be less than one in 30 billion.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Acid phosphatase test The Acid Phosphatase Test: is used in the chemical analysis of semen. The prostatic secretion element of seminal fluid contains 500 to 1000 times greater acid phosphatase than any other body fluid. Human red cells, semen of higher apes, and juice of cauliflower have acid phosphatase levels similar to that of human semen. The concentration of acid phosphatase gradually falls with time in vaginal secretions, and positive reactions are found for periods of thirty-six hours, with gradual disappearance in 72 hours, but is little changed if the body is refrigerated. Five to ten ml. of normal saline solution is placed in the vagina with a syringe. The fluid is then removed and placed in a sealed tube and refrigerated for enzyme examination. Concentration in excess of hundred Bodansky units with or without motile sperms indicates that ejaculation occurred within twelve hours of examination. Dried seminal stains which have not undergone putrefaction retain acid phosphatase activity for weeks or months, although enzymatic activity decreases slowly with time. The concentration is slowly reduced when the stain is left at room temperature and exposed to light. Heating the specimen to 60 degrees or over destroys it within five minutes. Low levels of acid phosphatase are present in vaginal secretions. In humans, acid phosphatase content is greater than in animals. This test is conclusive in the absence of demonstrable sperms or in aspermia.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Strychnine Trychnine Poisoning:- Strychnine is an odourless white crystalline prism that melts at 275 to 285 degrees C with decomposition. It is very bitter in taste and more powerful than brucine Mechanism of action:- Strychnine antagonizes the inhibitory neurotransmitter amino-acid glycine at postsynaptic receptors. Inhibitory glycine receptors are abundant in the spinal cord and brain stem where they are mainly involved in the regulation of motor functions. When inhibitors are blocked, ongoing neuronal excitability is increased and sensory stimuli produce exaggerated reflex effects thus producing powerful muscle contractions. Glycine receptors in higher brain centres such as substantia nigra, neostriatum and hippocampus are commonly insensitive to strychnine, explaining why strychnine symptoms are largely spinal in origin. Clinical features:- If seeds are swallowed uncrushed, the hard pericarp resists digestion and seeds are passed in faeces without any poisonous symptoms. With crushed seeds, symptoms begin to appear within 15 to 30 minutes. Bitter taste in the mouth Sense of uneasiness, restlessness, fear and anxiety Increase difficulty in breathing and swallowing Muscle twitching and spasms of the muscle followed by convulsions. The convulsions are more marked in anti-gravity muscles and body arches in the hyperextension position and lie on the heel and head. This position of the body is known as opisthotonos. It is the most common position. However, at times, the body may bend forward and the condition is called emprosthotonos. If the body bends sidewise (i.e. lateral bending), the condition is called pleurothotonos. Contraction of the muscles of the face causes the widening of the angle of the mouth with creases appearing around the eyelids. This condition is known as risus sardonicus. Also called a sardonic smile due to grimacing that occurred due to muscle contraction of the face. There is difficulty in breathing during convulsions due to the contraction of the chest muscles and diaphragm. Complications:- Hypoxia Hyperthermia Rhabdomyolysis Metabolic acidosis/ lactic acidosis</p>\n<p></p>",
