      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Tricuspid regurgitation The physical findings of an early systolic murmur and a 7 cm distance between the height of the blood in the right internal jugular vein and the sternal angle are most suggestive of tricuspid regurgitation. Tricuspid regurgitation is a valvular heart disease characterized by the backflow of blood from the right ventricle into the right atrium during systole. This can cause a systolic murmur to be heard on auscultation, and can also result in jugular venous distension, which can be seen as an elevated jugular venous pressure and a taller column of blood in the jugular vein.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The combination of an early systolic murmur and high right atrial pressure is indicative of tricuspid regurgitation. This lesion is common in narcotic abusers with infective endocarditis. Early systolic murmurs begin with the first heart sound and end in mid-systole.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Third-degree heart block Patients with third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (complete heart block) are frequently hemodynamically unstable; as a result, experience syncope, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Syncope (fainting) is a transient loss of consciousness caused by inadequate blood flow to the brain. Transient decreases in cerebral blood flow are usually due to one of three general mechanisms: disorders of vascular tone or blood volume, cardiovascular disorders, or cerebrovascular disease. Approximately one-fourth of syncopal episodes are of cardiac origin and are due to either transient obstruction of blood flow through the heart or sudden decreases in cardiac output due to cardiac arrhythmias, such as bradycardia, heart block, or sinus arrest (neuro cardiogenic syncope). Third-degree (complete) heart block results when the conduction of the action potential from the atria to the ventricles is completely interrupted. Under these conditions, pacemaker cells within the His-Purkinje system or the ventricular muscle cause the ventricles to beat at a low rate (idioventricular rhythm) independently of the atria. Although the heart rate may be high enough to adequately perfuse the brain under resting conditions, Third-degree heart block is caused by conduction system disturbances, inferior wall MI, and digitalis toxicity.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. When the conduction disturbance is due to disease in the AV node, the idioventricular rhythm is normally about 45 beats/min. When the conduction disturbance is below the AV node (infranodal block) due to disease in the bundle of His, firing of more peripheral ventricular pacemakers can decrease heart rate to below 30 beats/min with periods of asystole that may last a minute or more. The resultant cerebral ischemia causes dizziness and fainting (Stokes-Adams syndrome). Sinus arrhythmia is a change in the heart rate produced by the normal variation in the rate of phase 4 depolarization of the SA nodal pacemaker cells between inspiration and expiration. Option B. First-degree heart block is defined as a higher-than-normal PR interval (greater than 0.2 seconds). Second-degree heart block occurs when the action potential fails to reach the ventricles some, but not all, of the time. Tachycardia is a heart rate above 100 beats per minute. Option C. There are two non-distinct types of second-degree AV blocks, called Type 1 and Type 2. In both types, a P wave is blocked from initiating a QRS complex; but, in Type 1, there are increasing delays in each cycle before the omission, whereas, in Type 2, there is no such pattern .</p>\n<p></p>",

Although pulmonary vascular resistance is relatively small compared with systemic vascular resistance, it nonetheless produces a pressure drop between the right ventricle and the left atrium. Because most of the resistance in the systemic vasculature occurs at the level of the arterioles, there is a large pressure gradient between the aorta and the capillaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options: Rest options are inappropriate.
