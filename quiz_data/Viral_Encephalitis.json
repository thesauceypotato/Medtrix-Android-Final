Exposure usually occurs when patients come into contact with contaminated saliva from an infected animal (eg, dog, bat), v1hich which likely occurred during this patient's camping trip in New Mexico Jaisalmer.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The virus contains a bullet-shaped envelope with knob-like glycoproteins that allow it to attach to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction. The virus replicates locally within the muscle tissue of the bite wound for several days or weeks and then travels in a retrograde fashion through peripheral nerve axons to the dorsal root ganglia. From there, it rapidly ascends the spinal cord and infects the diencephalon, hippocampus, and brain stem. Patients initially develop a nonspecific flu-like prodrome (fever, malaise, myalgias); paresthesias radiating proximally from a known wound site can be an important clue. When the virus enters the CNS, the infection typically evolves into rabies encephalitis, which is characterized by painful pharyngeal spasms leading to avoidance of water (hydrophobia), mental status changes, muscular rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction (pupil dilation, hypersalivation). Once symptoms of rabies encephalitis appear, post-exposure prophylaxis is no longer effective and nearly all patients die.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. Epstein-Barr virus binds to CD21 on inactive B-lymphocytes and results in infectious mononucleosis, which is usually characterized by sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, malaise, and atypical lymphocytosis. Because this virus is a member of the Herpesviridae family, initial infection is followed by a long-standing (usually asymptomatic) latent infection. Option C. Rhinovirus binds intracellular adhesion molecule-1, which is found on nasopharyngeal and adenoid epithelial cells. It is associated with the common cold, not agitation, pharyngeal spasms, and hallucinations. Option D. Th e influenza virus has hemagglutinin glycoproteins that allow it to attach to sialic acids on the surface of the respiratory epithelium. Influenza is usually characterized by fever, myalgias, cough, headache, and respiratory symptoms; agitation and pharyngeal spasm are not typical features.</p>\n<p></p>",

Prophylactic vaccination is recommended for individuals at high exposure risk (eg, veterinarians, cave explorers, laboratory workers handling infected tissues, travelers to countries where rabid dogs are prevalent).
