      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Abdominal pain is the most common presenting symptom of ectopic pregnancy and may be present in at least 90% of the patients. True. Abdominal pain is indeed a hallmark symptom of ectopic pregnancy, occurring in the majority of cases. It often presents with or without vaginal bleeding and can be severe in ruptured ectopic pregnancies. PID and sexually transmitted infections are a major risk factor. True. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, are well-known risk factors because they can cause tubal damage and increase the likelihood of implantation outside the uterus. Low values of progesterone are usually diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy; however, there's no specific value to completely rule out or exclude ectopic pregnancy. True. Progesterone levels can help in the evaluation, as low levels may indicate a nonviable pregnancy, but they are not definitive for diagnosing ectopic pregnancy. Additional methods, such as ultrasound and serial beta-hCG measurements, are necessary for confirmation. Oral methotrexate is a viable medical alternative to surgery in ectopic pregnancy patients presenting with shock or renal failure. False. Methotrexate is contraindicated in patients with shock or unstable conditions, as it is only suitable for hemodynamically stable patients with unruptured ectopic pregnancies and normal renal and hepatic function. Surgical intervention is the standard treatment for patients presenting with shock.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Management of Ectopic Pregnancy (As per NICE guidelines 2019) Expectant Management Medical Management Surgical Management Not doing anything Resolve by itself Follow-up Clinical stable & pain free Size of GS <3.5 cm with no FHR Sr. B-hCG <1000 IU/L Able to come for follow-up Methotrexate No significant pain Unruptured ectopic GS <3.5 cm with no FHR \u03b2-hCG <1500 IU/L Able to return for follow-up Significant Pain GS>3.5 mm with FHR \u03b2-hCG > 5000 IU/L Methotrexate 50 mg/m\u00b2 (single dose is preferred) Check for \u03b2-hCG-Day 2, 4 &7 Salpingectomy (complete removal) Salpingotomy (incision \u2192 remove \u2192 suture) Salpingostomy (Incise  \u2192remove\u2192 kept open) Drop in 15% of \u03b2-hCG from previous value \u2192 she is responding Less than 15% drop \u2192   Repeat Max. 3 doses\u2192 Surgery Most preferred: Salping ectomy If only 1 tube-> gotomy or ostomy (recurrence is high) If \u03b2 -hCG 1500-5000 IU/L \u2192 Either medical or surgical management can be offered Drugs used in Medical Management (Most PG Males are very knowledgeable) \u25cf       Methotrexate \u25cf        PGF2- \u03b1 \u25cf       Mifepristone \u25cf       Actinomycin \u25cf       Vasopressin \u25cf       KCL</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation_images": [],
      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after 6 weeks Increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after 6 weeks Incorrect (not a physiological change). Blood pressure typically decreases in the first and second trimesters due to reduced systemic vascular resistance caused by hormonal changes (mainly progesterone). It begins to rise gradually in the third trimester, approaching pre-pregnancy levels near term. Hence, an increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after 6 weeks is not a normal physiological change . Peripheral resistance to insulin leading to hyperinsulinemia Correct (physiological change). During pregnancy, insulin resistance increases, particularly in the second and third trimesters, due to placental hormones such as human placental lactogen (hPL), progesterone, and cortisol. This can lead to compensatory hyperinsulinemia to maintain glucose homeostasis. Fasting hypoglycemia and postprandial hyperglycemia Correct (physiological change). Fasting hypoglycemia occurs due to increased glucose utilization by the fetus and placenta. Postprandial hyperglycemia occurs due to insulin resistance and slower glucose uptake by maternal tissues. Increased plasma volume and RBC mass Correct (physiological change). Plasma volume increases significantly (by 40-50%) to support placental circulation, and RBC mass increases (by 20-30%) to enhance oxygen delivery. However, the increase in plasma volume exceeds that of RBC mass, leading to physiological anemia of pregnancy.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Cardiovascular System Parameters which increase in pregnancy Parameters which decrease in pregnancy \u25cf       Cardiac output = Stroke volume x HR (\u2191 by 20%) All these increase in pregnancy \u25cf       Remember : Cardiac output increase by 40% during pregnancy, 50% during each uterine contraction in labour and 80% immediately postpartum \u25cf       Peripheral vascular resistances (as progesterone has a smooth muscle relaxant effect) \u25cf        Diastolic BP and systolic BP (Decrease in diastolic BP > systolic BP) \u25cf        Mean arterial BP \u25cf [ Systolic BP + (Distolic BP \u00d7 2)] 3 Maximum risk of cardiac failure in pregnancy \u2192 is in Arterio venous O 2 gradient (venous blood causes more O 2 immediate postpartum period > intrapartum period >28-32 weeks of pregnancy.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is characterized by the passive movement of the fetal head to align with the shoulders as the neck untwists from the torsion that occurred during internal rotation. Passive movement of the head due to untwisting of the neck: Correct After the head is delivered, it rotates to its original position relative to the shoulders. This realignment is passive and occurs due to the release of torsion in the fetal neck. Movement of the head by 1/8th of the circle due to torsion: This describes the extent of the rotation during internal rotation of the head, not restitution itself. Stretching of the vulval outlet by the head: This describes the crowning phase, not restitution. External rotation after delivery of the shoulder: This occurs after restitution when the shoulders rotate to align with the pelvic outlet, causing the head to rotate externally. This is called external rotation or the second rotation , which follows restitution.</p>\n<p></p>",

Given her history of rheumatic heart disease , mitral valve replacement, and Warfarin therapy , the management approach must consider both the ovarian mass and her anticoagulation status. The findings suggest a functional ovarian cyst , which is common in the early stages of pregnancy. These cysts are usually benign and can resolve spontaneously without intervention. Why the recommended management is Repeat USG after 6-12 weeks: Functional cysts : These cysts often form due to the hormonal changes of pregnancy and can spontaneously resolve. Repeat ultrasound after 6-12 weeks is appropriate to assess whether the cyst persists, shrinks, or resolves. CA-125 measurement : This is a tumor marker typically used in the evaluation of ovarian malignancy, but it is not routinely used for assessing ovarian cysts, especially in a young woman with no other concerning features. Surgical intervention : This is typically not needed for a simple, benign cyst, especially in early pregnancy, unless there are complications like torsion, rupture, or signs of malignancy, which are not present here.

This condition is commonly referred to as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . The lab results further support this diagnosis: FSH = 2 mIU/mL (low or normal) LH = 0.3 mIU/mL (very low) TSH = 1.2 \u00b5IU/mL (normal, ruling out thyroid dysfunction) Prolactin = 20 ng/mL (normal, ruling out hyperprolactinemia) The low levels of both FSH and LH suggest that the hypothalamus is not producing adequate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn leads to insufficient release of FSH and LH from the pituitary.

According to the current guidelines for cervical cancer screening: Pap smear testing should start at age 21 years, regardless of sexual activity, and should be repeated every 3 years until the age of 29. For women aged 30 and above , HPV testing can be added to Pap smear testing (co-testing), or HPV testing alone can be done, typically every 5 years . In this case, since Dr. Priya is planning to screen a woman in her 20s , the most appropriate guideline would be to start Pap smear screening at age 21 , with repeat testing every 3 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Pap Smear Next step Normal/Reactive \u25cf       Resume Pap smear as per ACOG Inflammation/Infection \u25cf       Treatment of Infection \u25cf       Repeat Pap smear after 4 to 6 months ASCUS Options are: \u25cf       Repeat Pap Smear after 6 months \u25cb       If Pap smear report is ASCUS after 6 months also, then do colposcopy \u25cf       If the female is > 30 years ,do HPV -DNA testing .
