It is a painful condition and common in tennis players and violinists. Golfer's elbow (medial epicondylitis) is a painful condition caused by a small tear or an inflammation or irritation in the origin of the flexor muscles of the forearm from the medial epicondyle. Avoidance of repetitive bending (flexing) of the forearm is advised in order to not compress the ulnar nerve Nursemaid's elbow or pulled elbow is a radial head subluxation and occurs in toddlers when the child is lifted by the wrist. It is caused by a partial tear (or loose) of the annular ligament and thus the radial head to slip out of position.</p>\n<p></p>",

The base is occupied by a Concavo-convex articular surface for the trapezium. The dorsal surface of the shaft is uniformly convex. The head is less convex and broader from side to side than the heads of other metacarpals. The ulnar and radial corners of the palmar surface show impressions for sesamoid bones. The first metacarpal bone (lying on a more anterior plane) is rotated medially through 90\u00b0relative to the other metacarpals. As a result of this rotation, the movements of the thumb take place at right angles to those of other digits. It does not articulate with any other metacarpal bone.</p>\n<p></p>",
