The patient loses the taste and flavors of the food with a loss of appetite. He is also disadvantaged, unaware of environmental dangers, such as smoke, toxic gases, etc. In such cases, a simple maneuver called polite yawning can be taught, whereby some air passes through the nose . This Manoeuvre consists of lowering the jaw along with its attached muscles of the floor of the mouth and tongue with closed lips. This creates negative pressure in the oral cavity and oropharynx. The patient has to perform the technique several times to induce an inflow of air through the nose. A nasal airflow-inducing maneuver (NAIM) rapidly increases oral cavity volume when the lips are closed airtight. The potential vacuum, prompted by the expansion of the oral cavity, must be filled, resulting in airflow through the nasal cavity. Repeating this maneuver rapidly creates a pumping effect, and sufficient airflow through the nose is established to enable smell.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Invasion of laryngeal muscles Cord mobility is essential in determining the outcome of T2 lesions . Impaired mobility indicates deeper invasion into intrinsic laryngeal muscles or para glottic space and, thus, poor response to radiation . Partnering para glottic or subglottic space is also associated with an undetected attack of laryngeal cartilages and hence poor survival results . With radiation, the cure rate of T2 lesions with normal cord mobility is 86%, which drops to 63% if cord mobility is impaired.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Normal cord mobility suggests that surface growth is limited. The vocal cord exhibits a reciprocating respiratory motion, abducting in inspiration and returning to the intermediate position in expiration. Option:C. Thyroid cartilage invasion does not affect vocal cord mobility. Option: D, In this case, the nerve damage doesn't cause impaired mobility, but the invasion of the laryngeal muscle affects mobility.</p>\n<p></p>",
