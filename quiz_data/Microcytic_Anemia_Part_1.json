Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a genetic disease that affects children and adults. FA is caused by pathogenic variants (ie, mutations) in one of the numerous genes involved with DNA repair. They typically have short stature,caf\u00e9 au lait spots and anomalies involving the radius, thumb and genitourinary tract. Prognosis: Many patients eventually develop AML . Older patients are extremely likely to develop head and neck, oesophagal, gastrointestinal, vulvar and anal cancers. FA is caused by an inability to properly repair DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), an especially deleterious type of DNA damage in which opposing strands of DNA are abnormally joined. Disordered repair of ICLs leads to genomic instability, aberrant cell cycle regulation, and cell death. Hematological abnormalities: Symptoms appear progressively and often lead to complete bone marrow (BM) failure. While at birth blood count is usually normal, macrocytosis /non-megaloblastic anaemia, is the first detected abnormality, Within the next 10 years, over 50% of patients presenting haematological abnormalities will have developed pancytopenia. The deficiencies cause an increased risk of haemorrhage and recurrent infections, respectively. Treatment: The first line of therapy is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Approximately 50-75% of patients respond to androgens, which are used when transplantation is not an option.</p>\n<p></p>",

In the given clinical scenario, the patient has a complaint of dysphagia to food and the endoscopy image shows an oesophagal web along with iron deficiency anaemia which makes it a case of Plummer Wilson syndrome. For iron deficiency anaemia- s. iron is normal to decreased borderline, s. ferritin will be decreased and s. TIBC will be increased. Hence the correct answer will be option D.</p>\n<p></p>",

Iron deficiency anaemia develops in 3 stages:- Stage of negative iron balance - in this, there is a decrease in iron stores with normal S. iron and RBC morphology. Stage of iron-deficient erythropoiesis - decrease in s. iron level occurs but the morphology of RBC remains normal. Stage of iron deficiency anaemia - fall in haemoglobin with microcytic hypochromic RBC.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Transferrin saturation is calculated as the serum iron/total iron binding capacity (SI/TIBC). Ferritin is an acute phase reactant, and serum levels are increased by liver disease, inflammation, and malignancy. In these settings, it is not a good reflection of iron stores.</p>\n<p></p>",
