They result from flying missiles generated by an explosion.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Marshall\u2019s triad: The blast may drive multiple fragments of bomb or pieces of nearby objects, e.g., gravel, glass, wood, brick, plaster, etc. through the air into the skin and cause bruises, abrasions and puncture lacerations intimately mixed on the skin. This triad of injury (Marshall\u2019s triad) is diagnostic of explosion injury.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Primary blast injury Due to the pressure effects of blast wave (barotraumas), organs most likely to suffer damage due to these injuries are those which contain air, e.g. auditory apparatus, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system. External injuries are not seen. Option: C. Tertiary blast injuries Victim is thrown by the blast wind or falling of masonry on the victim. These injuries resemble the classic blunt force injuries. Option: D. Quaternary blast injury Burns are sometimes called quaternary injuries. The characteristic burns seen in explosions are flash burns. They are not due to flame, but due to radiant heat of high intensity.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Injuries caused by explosion: Abrasion Contusion (bruise) Laceration (punctate)</p>\n<p></p>",

Activated charcoal absorbs the poison. Stomach can be washed with 0.2% copper sulphate solution or 0.2 g. of copper sulphate may be given every 5 minutes until vomiting occurs. It coats the particles of phosphorus with a film of copper phosphide which is relatively harmless. As it has caustic properties and can cause acute copper poisoning adequate care should be taken. Vitamin K, 20 mg. i.v. in repeated doses to combat hypoprothrombinemia or blood transfusion. The bowel should be evacuated with magnesium sulphate. Wash out the bowel and repeat at intervals for several days. Oil and fats should be avoided as they dissolve phosphorus and promote absorption.

Heat Cramps (miner's cramps, stoker's cramps or fireman's cramps) They are caused by a rapid dehydration of body through the loss of water and salt in the sweat. It is seen in workers in high temperature, when sweating has been profuse. The onset is usually sudden. Severe and painful paroxysmal cramps affecting the muscles of the arms, legs and abdomen occur. The face is flushed, the pupils dilated and the patient complains of dizziness, tinnitus, headache and vomiting. Intravenous injection of saline gives rapid relief. Heat Prostration (heat exhaustion, heat syncope, or heat collapse) Heat prostration is a condition of collapse without increase in body temperature, which follows exposure to excessive heat. It is precipitated by muscular work and unsuitable clothing. There is extreme exhaustion and peripheral vascular collapse. The patient feels suddenly weak, giddy and sick. He may stagger or fall. The face is pale, the skin cold, the temperature subnormal. The pupils are dilated, the pulse small and thready and the respiration sighing. The patient usually recovers if placed at rest, but death may take place from heart failure. Heat hyperpyrexia or heat stroke A fever above 41.5\u00b0C is termed hyperpyrexia. Heat stroke is a condition characterized by rectal temperature greater than 41\u00b0C., and neurological disturbances, such as psychosis, delirium, stupor, coma and convulsions where sweating is absent. The term thermic fever or \"sunstroke\" is used when there has been direct exposure to the sun.</p>\n<p></p>",

Magnesium sulphate reduces organ toxicity, corrects hypomagnesemia and arrhythmias.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Chemical test for aluminum phosphide: 5 ml. of gastric aspirate and 15 ml. of water is put in a flask and the mouth is covered with a filter paper impregnated with silver nitrate (0.1N). The flask is heated at 50\u00b0C for 15 to 20 minutes. If phosphine is present, the filter paper turns black. A piece of filter paper impregnated with 0.1 N silver nitrate solution is used in the form of a mask through which the patient breathes for 5 to 10 minutes. The filter paper turns black if phosphine is present. The filter paper impregnated with AgNO3 (0.1N) is used in the form of a face mask and the patient is asked to breathe in and out of this filter paper for 15 to 20 minutes. The presence of PH3 is indicated by the blackening of filter paper. In breath, the test is positive only in patients who have ingested more than 6 g. of AlP. The reaction: AlP + 3 H 2 O \u2192 Al(OH) 3 + PH 3 Treatment of Aluminium Phosphide: Gastric lavage with potassium permanganate is done after endotracheal intubation as it oxidizes phosphene to non-toxic phosphate and is repeated 2 or 3 times. Give activated charcoal 100 g. orally mixed with sorbitol (not water) using 240 ml for every 30 g. to adsorb phosphine. Antacids reduce symptoms pertaining to the stomach and reduce absorption of phosphine. Liquid paraffin is given for excretion of ALP and phosphine from the gut. There is no specific antidote. Magnesium sulphate reduces organ toxicity, corrects hypomagnesaemia and arrhythmias. The usual dose is one g. repeated for the next two hours, and then 1 to 1.5 g. every 6 hours for 5 to 7 days in the form of continuous i.v. infusion. To treat shock 4 to 6 litres of fluids are to be administered during the first 3 to 6 hours; of this 50% must be normal saline. Low dose dopamine infusion, 4 to 6 microgram/kg/min is useful. V. hydrocortisone 400 mg every 4 to 6 hours is highly effective. It reduces the dose of dopamine. Hypoxia is treated with oxygen. Shock should be treated with fluids and hydrocortisone. Metabolic acidosis should be corrected with i.v. sodium carbonate. Peritoneal or hemodialysis is useful.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
