Introducing additional medications like ipratropium doesn't solve the underlying issue of poor inhaler technique.

After receiving the baseline measurements, Rakesh is prescribed an \"antigout\" medication. Several weeks into the therapy, Dr. Mehra repeats the 24-hour urine uric acid measurement to evaluate the drug's effectiveness. He observes a significant reduction in the urate content in the post-treatment sample. Throughout the treatment period, Rakesh confirms no new health concerns, and he assures Dr. Mehra that his daily proteins and purine intake remains unchanged. Given these observations, which of the following drugs was most likely prescribed to Rakesh?",
