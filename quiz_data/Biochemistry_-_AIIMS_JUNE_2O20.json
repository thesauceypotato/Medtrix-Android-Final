      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Capping In the mammalian genome, DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism involving the transfer of a methyl group onto the C5 position of the cytosine to form 5-methylcytosine. Mismatch Repair: In mismatch repair errors in only the newly synthesized strand are repaired. The repair machinery identify this strand by being not methylated. This mechanism makes sure that the repair machinery doesn\u2019t affect the correct parent strand which is methylated. DNA Replication: Dnmt (DNA Methyl Transferases) functions during DNA replication to copy the DNA methylation pattern from the parental DNA strand onto the newly synthesized daughter strand. This maintenance methylation activity is necessary to preserve DNA methylation after every cellular DNA replication cycle. Epigenetics: Extensive methylation of cytosine of the DNA at CG sites by DNA Methyl Transferases (DNMTs) is an epigenetics phenomenon which can either result in Gene silencing or Gene activation. Capping of mRNA in eukaryotes: 7-Methyl Guanosine cap is added at the 5\u2019 end of mRNA by enzyme Guanylyl Transferase. So, this is RNA methylation, not DNA. Methyl group is donated by SAM (S-Adenosyl Methionine). This cap facilitate initiation of translation and stabilize mRNA by preventing it from attack by 5\u2019 exonucleases.</p>\n<p></p>",
