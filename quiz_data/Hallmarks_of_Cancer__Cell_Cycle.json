      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Multiple growth factors govern the gene Genes that promote autonomous cell growth in cancer cells are called oncogenes , and their unmutated cellular counterparts are called proto-oncogenes . Oncogenes are created by mutations in proto-oncogenes and encode proteins called oncoproteins that have the ability to promote cell growth in the absence of normal growth-promoting signals . Oncoproteins resemble the normal products of proto-oncogenes but bear mutations that often inactivate internal regulatory elements; consequently, their activity in cells does not depend on external signals . Cells expressing oncoproteins are thus freed from the normal checkpoints and controls that limit growth , and as a result proliferate excessively .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Gain of function mutation in KIT is seen in Gastrointestinal tumors (GIST).

Also known as Guardian of Genome and Molecular Policeman of Gene . Tumor Suppressor gene that regulates cell cycle progression, DNA repair, cellular senescence, and apoptosis, is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers. The role of p53 in maintaining the integrity of the genome. Activation of normal p53 by DNA-damaging agents or by hypoxia leads to cell cycle arrest in G, and induction of DNA repair by transcriptional upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKNIA (encoding the cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor p21) and GADD45 genes. Successful repair of DNA allows cells to proceed with the cell cycle; if DNA repair fails, p53 triggers either apoptosis or senescence. In cells with loss or mutations of the p53 gene, DNA damage does not induce cell cycle arrest or DNA repair, and genetically damaged cells proliferate, giving rise eventually to malignant neoplasms. Germline mutation of p53: Li Fraumeni syndrome . Sporadic mutations are associated with Tumours in Brain, Breast, Lung, Adrenal, and Skin (SCC) . The p53 protein is the central monitor of stress in the cell and can be activated by anoxia, inappropriate signaling by mutated oncoproteins, or DNA damage . p53 controls the expression and activity of proteins involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, cellular senescence, and apoptosis. DNA damage is sensed by complexes containing kinases of the ATM/ATR family ; these kinases phosphorylate p53, liberating it from inhibitors such as MDM2. Active p53 then upregulates the expression of proteins such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 , thereby causing cell-cycle arrest at the G1 /S checkpoint . This pause allows cells to repair DNA damage. If DNA damage cannot be repaired, p53 induces additional events that lead to cellular senescence or apoptosis .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B.

Tumor Suppressor gene which when hypophosphorylated, exerts antiproliferative effects by binding and inhibiting E2F transcription factors that regulate genes required for cells to pass through the G1-S phase cell cycle checkpoint . Normal growth factor signaling leads to RB hyperphosphorylation and inactivation , thus promoting cell cycle progression . The antiproliferative effect of RB is evaded in cancers through a variety of mechanisms, including Loss-of-function mutations affecting RB Gene amplifications of CDK4 and cyclin D genes Loss of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p16/INK4a) Viral oncoproteins that bind and inhibit RB ( E7 protein in HPV ). The role of RB in regulating the G i -S checkpoint of the cell cycle. Hypophosphorylated RB in complex with the E2F transcription factors binds to DNA, recruits chromatin-modifying factors (histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases), and inhibits transcription of genes whose products are required for the S phase of the cell cycle. When RB is phosphorylated by the cyclin D-CDK4, cyclin D-CDK6, and cyclin E-CDK2 complexes, it releases E2F. The latter then activates transcription of S-phase genes. Phosphorylation of RB is inhibited by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors because they inactivate cyclin-CDK complexes. In most cancers, the G-S checkpoint is defective as a result of mutation of one of four genes that regulate the phosphorylation of RB; these genes are RB, CDK4, the genes encoding cyclin D proteins, and CDKN2A (p16).

Chromothrypsis is observed in 1% to 2% of cancers as a whole and is particularly common in osteosarcomas and gliomas . It appears to result from a single event in which dozens to hundreds of chromosome breaks occur within part or across the entirety of a single chromosome or several chromosomes . The genesis of these breaks is unknown, but DNA repair mechanisms are activated in affected cells that stitch the pieces together in a haphazard way , creating many chromosome rearrangements and also resulting in the loss of some chromosome segments .

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Rb, p53 This patient has HPV infection , a dsDNA virus that causes anogenital warts as well as certain cancers like vaginal cancer and cervical cancer . HPV produces two proteins , namely E6 and E7 which are responsible for the loss of function mutation of p53 and Rb gene respectively . These two genes are tumor suppressor genes , so, their loss of function mutation results in an increased r isk of cancer . Hence, the correct answer is option B.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>PAP smear is a screening test used to screen for cervical cancer and can also detect low-stage cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) . High-risk HPVs (16 and 18) are by far the most important factor in the development of cervical cancer. HPVs are DNA viruses. Sites in the female genital tract that are susceptible to infection include areas of squamous epithelial trauma and repair, where the virus may access basal cells, and the immature metaplastic squamous cells that are present at the squamocolumnar junction of the cervix Here, the viruses make factors that interfere with host proteins that regulate cell proliferation. The ability of HPV to act as a carcinogen depends on the viral E6 and E7 proteins , which interfere with the activity of the key tumor suppressor proteins , p53, and RB, respectively . MNEMONIC: E 6 goes with p 5 3 (5 and 6 go together).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option:A. E6, E7, is incorrect because the question is asking about the genes and not the proteins . E6 and E7 are examples of proteins and not genes. Option:C. LMP1, and BCL2, are incorrect because LMP1 and BCL2 are the genes that are more commonly associated with Epstein Barr Virus . Option:D. BRCA1, BRCA2, is incorrect because BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the tumor suppressor genes that are more commonly associated with breast cancer .</p>\n<p></p>",

This is because in Aerobic glycolysis (Warburg) rapidly dividing cells are provided with metabolic intermediates that are needed for the synthesis of cellular components ie intermediate components (DNA, RNA, Proteins, Lipids, Organelles, etc) which are required for the growth of any rapid dividing cells for it to divide into daughter cells .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.
