This extensor retinaculum has   six compartments through which the extensor tendons pass. These compartments prevent bowstringing of the extensor ten- dons and provide reliable landmark for surgical approaches. The first compartment contains the tendons of abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB). These two tendons constitute the radial border of the anatomical snuffbox. Stenosing tenosynovitis of these tendons is common in this compartment and is known as de Quervain\u2019s disease. The second compartment is located on the radial side of the Lister\u2019s tubercle and it contains the tendon of extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis (ECRL and ECRB). Tenosynovitis is also common in this region and is known as intersection syndrome. The third compartment contains the tendon of extensor pollicis longus (EPL). EPL forms the ulnar boarder of the anatomical snuffbox. Rupture of the EPL tendon may occur occasionally following fracture of the distal radius or a fracture of the distal radius treated by plating. Attrition of this tendon is also common in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The fourth compartment contains the tendons of extensor digitorum communis and extensor indicis proprius. Tenosynovitis and spontaneous rupture of the tendons of this compartment due to rheumatoid arthritis is commonly seen. The fifth compartment contains the tendons of extensor digiti minimi (EDM) and extensor digiti quinti (EDQ).

(Labelled as 4) It is more susceptible to fracture because it lies obliquely across the two rows of carpal bones. It also lies in the line of loading(i.e ,weight transmission) between forearm and the thumb. There are a variety of wrist injuries that can occur from a traumatic fall on an outstretched hand. These injuries are termed FOOSH (fall on an outstretched hand) injuries. Probably the most well- known FOOSH is a distal radius fracture. In the X-ray labeling is: OPTION A: 1 = Radius OPTION B: 2 = Ulna OPTIONS C: 3 = 3rd metacarpal</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Scaphoid fracture Scaphoid is the most common carpal to get injured followed by triquetral. It is more common in adults as compared to children. Scaphoid may be divided into proximal pole, middle part (also known as waist) and distal pole. Most common site of fracture is the waist and most common site of avascular necrosis is proximal pole as the blood supply of the scaphoid is retrograde from distal to proximal pole. Clinical feature Pain and swelling over the radial aspect of wrist following is fall on outstretched hand. Tenderness can be elicited in the anatomical snuff box. Radiological fracture AP, lateral and oblique all view should be done. A PA view with wrist in ulnar deviation is best to evaluate fracture of scaphoid followed by oblique view. Initially the x-ray may not be able to show the fracture so they must be repeated after 2 weeks. MRI may be considered in cases when fracture is not visible on x-ray and clinical suspicion is there. Treatment Non-displaced, stable scaphoid fracture are managed by thumb spica scaphoid cast (cast extending from below to the elbow to metacarpal head, includes the thumb, up to the inter phalangeal joint. The wrist is maintained in a little dorsiflexion or neutral flexion and radial deviation (glass/tumbler holding position). The fracture heals usually within 10- 12 weeks. If no union is seen in around 18-20 weeks surgical fixation may be considered by \"HERBERT SCREW\" (percutaneous fixation with cannulated screw) Displaced unstable scaphoid fracture Crite5ryria for displacement: more than 1mm displacement in AP or oblique view, lunocapitate angulation more than 15 degree or scapholunate angulation more than 45 degree lateral view. Treatment options are If signs of non-union are seen then vascularised bone grafting is done Electrical and USG stimulations Excision of scaphoid: proximal fragment or distal fragment Proximal row carpectomy Partial or total arthrodesis</p>\n<p></p>",

Mean age at CRMO onset is approximately 10 years, with a range of 4\u201314 years, mean disease duration is approximately 5 years, and the mean number of flares per patient was approximately 6. Most studies reported a predominance in female patients, which is as high as up to 85%, or female to male ratio of 5:1. The etiology of most CRMO cases is not known. The episodes of systemic inflammation occur due to immune dysregulation without autoantibodies, pathogens or antigen-specific T cells. The infantile onset of CRMO is connected with a genetic mutation in Majeed syndrome and the deficiency of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (DIRA). It is characterized by the non-specific onset of pain with swell- ing and tenderness over the affected bone or joint, worsening at night. In long bones the metaphyseal regions are affected. The most common locations of osteomyelitis are: distal femur, proximal tibia, distal tibia, and distal fibula \u2013 34%, followed by the clavicle \u2013 24%, chest wall \u2013 13%, vertebral bodies from 2 to 8%, mandible, pelvis \u2013 14%, shoulder girdle, and small bones of the hands. Laboratory tests, such as white blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF- \u03b1 ) levels may be mildly elevated. Differential diagnosis should include acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (CRMO represents 2\u20135% of all osteomyelitis cases in children and adolescents), neoplasms, especially Ewing sarcoma, eosinophilic granuloma, osteoblastoma, osteoid osteoma as well as Langerhans cell histiocytosis or insufficiency fractures.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Chronic osteomyelitis Diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis is based on history, careful physical examinations, routine laboratory profile, radiographic findings and finally confirmed by operative findings when material is recovered for culture, sensitivity tests and histological examination to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude other types of infection. Three types are encountered: Active infection with swelling and continuous discharge from one or more sinuses. Controlled infection with frequent attacks of flare up of the infection when both general and local features of subacute infection appear and sinuses with purulent discharge reap- pear. Presence of a sinus with minimal discharge from time to time. Changes are evident in the radiograph of the subjacent bone. Patients are worried about the recurrent dis- charge but otherwise the patient is in good health, and no other local symptoms or signs are present. The culture from discharge usually shows a mixed flora. They are S. aureus, E. coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Proteus, Pseudomonas and other secondary contaminants.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Treatment should be guided by cultures obtained from bone and usually requires long-term antibiotics. If the infected meta- physeal region is intracapsular, or if blood vessels traverse the physis, may spread to a joint. A large subperiosteal abscess may elevate the periosteum completely from the shaft of the bone, causing occlusion of the main nutrient vessels and  death of the cortical bone leading to sequestrum formation.     In  such  situation,  the  stripped  periosteum,  provided  with its own blood supply from muscle attachments, lays down new bone (involucrum) in a shell around the old shaft (sequestrum). At the opposite extreme, there are occasionally cases where the blood supply of the whole bone has been lost, the entire diaphysis has sequestered, and yet very little surrounding subperiosteal bone may be seen. Dead bone can be absorbed by granulation tissue. This  is only possible when active infection has been controlled, and some blood supply to the bone and surrounding soft tissues is retained. Modern investigations like radionuclide imaging, CT scan or MRI can help to provide detailed information about   the bone and surrounding soft tissues, but these are not widely available and are expensive. Where local pain, swelling, irregular fever, raised local temperature, areas of redness, tenderness over the surface on palpation, purulent discharge through sinus or sinuses and thickening of the bone are present, as the infection is active, even though the general symptoms are minimal, with  variable thickening of bone and radiographs show presence of sequestra and bone abscess, operative debridement becomes mandatory.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION A:  A.

Incision begins at the junction of the thenar and hypothenar area; extends proximally initially transverse across flexion crease of the wrist at the ulnar border; then across forearm towards radial side of forearm; then in proximal fore- arm towards medial side creating convex flap towards lateral side. In the elbow it crosses along the medial border to reach the arm where it runs in arm along the medial part of the anterior arm. Injury to major nerves, palmar cutaneous branch of median nerve should be avoided while placing the incision. Incision should be deepened by cutting the deep fascia along the entire length of the incision. Dorsal fasciotomy should be added by placing a longitudinal lengthy incision in the midline. Two longitudinal incisions on  the dorsum of the hand also should be made: Antibiotics. Catheterisation. Mannitol or diuretics to cause diuresis, so as to flush the kidney. Fresh blood transfusion.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Lunate at place while others dislocate Perilunate dislocations and perilunate fracture dislocations involve dislocation of the carpus relative to the lunate which remains in normal alignment with the distal radius. They should not be confused  with  lunate  dislocations  where  the  lunate  is dislocated in a volar direction and no longer has normal radio lunate articulation. Overall, carpal dislocations account for less than 10% of all wrist injuries.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Perilunate dislocations typically occur in young adults with high energy trauma resulting in loading of a hyperextended, ulnarly deviated hand. Around 60% of perilunate dislocations are associated with a scaphoid fracture which is then termed   a trans-scaphoid perilunate dislocation . Typical history is of a fall onto a dorsiflexed wrist. There may or may not be obvious clinical deformity. Occasionally median nerve injury, arterial compromise or compartment syndrome may be evident due to the dislocation. Perilunate dislocation involves traumatic rupture of the radioscaphocapitate, scapholunate interosseous and lunotriquetral interosseous ligaments. Mayfield et. al. have proposed a four stage process to describe perilunar wrist instability where peri- lunate dislocation represents stage II. Radiographic features: The majority of cases involve dorsal dislocation of the capitate and carpus relative to the lunate which remains in near-normal alignment with the radius. Volar perilunate dislocation is rare. In a trans-scaphoid perilunate dislocation the proximal scaphoid maintains its lunate relationship, and the distal scaphoid and remainder of the carpal bones displaced dorsally. CT plays an important role in assessing for associated occult fractures; the most common and important being scaphoid fracture. Treatment and prognosis: Untreated there is a high-risk of median nerve palsy, pressure necrosis, compartment syndrome and long-term wrist dysfunction. As with other dislocations, perilunate dislocation should be reduced as soon as possible. Prompt open reduction with ligamentous repair is necessary. Despite treatment, long-term risk of degenerative arthritis is high (~60%). Also, there is a higher rate of nonunion of scaphoid fractures when associated with perilunate dislocation than with isolated scaphoid fractures. Differential diagnosis: The most important differential diagnosis is that of a lunate dislocation which can mimic a perilunate dislocation, especially on AP projection. The key to not confusing the two is the lateral projection. In a lunate dislocation, the radio lunate articulation is disrupted and the lunate is dislocated in a palmar direction in a perilunate dislocation, the radio lunate articulation is maintained.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Lunate dislocation Lunate is the most common carpal to dislocate Lunate may be associated with 2 types of dislocation Lunate dislocation: In this only lunate dislocates Perilunate dislocation: In this the lunate is in its position, rest of the carpals are dislocated.

In severe cases, salmonella infection may spread from the intestine to bloodstream and then other body sites which is known as typhoid fever, which   is treated with higher antibiotics. The elderly, infants and those with impaired immune systems are likely to develop severe illness.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Acute osteomyelitis It is most common type of bone infection. It is usually seen in children and more common in males. In adults it may be associated with immuno compromised state, like diabetes, malnutrition, drug addiction etc. Most common route of spread is hematogenous. Site involved in bone is usually metaphysis of a long bone which is most commonly involved. Reasons are:- Due to loop arrangement of vessels, the blood flow is slow and the organism gets time to stabilize itself at metaphysis. Less phagocytic activity at metaphysis The hip joint is the most commonly affected in young patients; however, the physis of the proximal humerus, radial neck and distal fibula also are intraarticular, and infection in these areas can lead to septic arthritis as well. Clinical features: commonly seen features are A. Bony tenderness (localised usually) Swelling Local temperature is raised High grade fever Joint stiffness and child does not move the joints due to pain which known as (Pseudoparalysis) Diagnosis can be made by the use of: ESR- peak elevation occurs in 3-5 days, return to normal after 3 weeks of treatment started. CRP- Most reliable non invasive investigation for acute infection, reaches raises within 6 hrs of infection. It peaks in 2 days and return to normal in one week after treatment is started. Local Aspiration: Thick needle can be put in the bone for aspiration of pus. This is the best way to diagnose the infection and organism. Blood culture: It should ideally be sent before antibiotics started, usually positive in only 50% of cases. D. Radiographs: Initially are negative; after 1 to 3 days can show soft tissue swelling and skeletal changes may take around 10-12 days to be visible on X-Rays. Ultrasonogram: USG can help in differentiating acute hematogenous osteomyelitis from cellulits, soft tissue abscess and acute septic arthritis. Bone scan: Three commonly used radio isotopes are Technetium: 99m scans can confirm diagnosis 24 to 48 hours after onset of disease Gallium and Indium scans can also be used. leukocytes differentiates osteomyelitis from reactive bone formation MRI: Can show inflammatory changes in bone marrow and soft tissues and it can reveal interosseous and subperiosteal collection.
