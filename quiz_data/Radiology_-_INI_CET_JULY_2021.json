EDH ;An extradural haematoma (also termed an epidural haematoma) is an extra-axial bleed occurring between the dura and skull bone. Around 2% of all head injuries presenting to the emergency department are extradural haematomas (EDHs), with associated significant morbidity and mortality, especially with advancing age. Option C. Post concussion syndrome ;Postconcussive syndrome (PCS) describes the constellation of symptoms that commonly occur after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), and patients who suffer more than one brain injury are at increased risk. Symptoms may be physical, cognitive, behavioral, and/or emotional in nature Option D. Brain herniation ;Brain herniation occurs when something inside the skull produces pressure that moves brain tissues. This is most often the result of brain swelling or bleeding from a head injury, stroke, or brain tumor. Brain herniation can be a side effect of tumors in the brain, including: Metastatic brain tumor.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The most common etiology of diffuse axonal injury involves high-speed motor vehicle accidents.
