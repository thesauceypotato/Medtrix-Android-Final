      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Both MHC I and II</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Rejection is a process in which T lymphocytes and antibodies produced against graft antigens react against and destroy tissue grafts . Rejection is most commonly seen within the initial months after transplantation and is heralded by clinical and biochemical signs of organ failure . Following transplantation, the recipient\u2019s T cells recognize donor HLA antigens from the graft (the allogeneic antigens, or alloantigens) by two pathways : Direct pathway: The graft antigens are either presented directly to recipient T cells by graft APCs Indirect pathway: The graft antigens are picked up by host APCs , processed (like any other foreign antigen), and presented to host T cells .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. MHC II. Correct . Option: B. MHC I. Correct . Option: D. None. Incorrect .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>It was thought that the direct killing of graft cells by CD 8+ CTLs is a major component of the reaction. However, more recent studies have established that an important component of this process is an inflammatory reaction in the graft triggered by cytokines secreted by activated CD4+ T cells . The inflammation results in increased vascular permeability and local accumulation of mononuclear cells (lymphocytes and macrophages), and graft injury is caused by the activated macrophage. Hence both MHC I and II are recognized in graft rejection .</p>\n<p></p>",

A hyperacutely rejecting kidney rapidly becomes cyanotic, mottled, and flaccid, and may excrete a mere few drops of bloody urine . Immunoglobulin and complement are deposited in the vessel wall , causing endothelial injury and fibrin-platelet thrombi . Neutrophils rapidly accumulate within arterioles, glomeruli, and peritubular capillaries. As these changes become diffuse and intense, the glomeruli undergo thrombotic occlusion of the capillaries , and fibrinoid necrosis occurs in arterial walls</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Types of graft/transplant: Type of graft/transplant Definition Orthotopic Transplant Organ implanted in the same anatomical location in the recipient as it was in the donor with the removal of the diseased organ.
