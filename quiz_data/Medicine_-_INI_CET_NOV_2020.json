If the patient is hemodynamically unstable or if adenosine , beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers are contraindicated or ineffective , synchronized electrical cardioversion (beginning at 100 J) should be performed. If digitalis toxicity is present or strongly suspected, as in the case of paroxysmal tachycardia with block, electrical cardioversion should be avoided. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is another type of \u201c short-circuit\u201d arrhythmia. It may result either from atrio-ventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) or from an accessory pathway, which may occur as part of the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The symptoms may include:- Palpitations , feeling lightheaded, sweating, shortness of breath, chest pain.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Acute Mesenteric ischemia The given clinical scenario is suggestive of Acute mesenteric ischemia. An embolus is the most common cause of acute mesenteric ischemia. Risk factors for acute mesenteric ischemia/embolus in the given clinical scenario include: The presence of an irregularly irregular pulse is suggestive of Atrial fibrillation. Previous history of ischemic heart disease/ MI The most important clue to an early diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia is the sudden onset of severe abdominal pain in a patient with atrial fibrillation or atherosclerosis. The pain is typically in the central abdomen and out of proportion to the physical findings. Associated symptoms can include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. With the onset of bowel infarction, abdominal distension, peritonitis and passage of bloody stools occur. The 'gold standard* for the diagnosis of an acute arterial occlusive disease is angiography, and management is laparotomy. The goal of operative exploration is to resect the compromised bowel and restore blood supply via embolectomy. Acute mesenteric ischaemia is the sudden decrease in the blood supply to the bowel, resulting in bowel ischaemia and, if not promptly treated, death. The common causes of acute mesenteric ischaemia can be classified into: Thrombus-in-situ (Acute Mesenteric Arterial Thrombosis, AMAT) Embolism (Acute Mesenteric Arterial Embolism, AMAE) Non-occlusive cause (Non-Occlusive Mesenteric Ischemia, NOMI) Venous occlusion and congestion (Mesenteric Venous Thrombosis, MVT) Traditionally, mesenteric ischaemia presents with a generalised abdominal pain, out of proportion to the clinical findings, although it can often be more variable or subtle than this. The patient will typically complain of a diffuse and constant pain, with associated nausea and vomiting in around 75% of cases. Abdominal examination will often reveal non-specific tenderness, with no specific clinical signs. In later stages (especially if the bowel has perforated), patients will have features of globalised peritonism. Importantly, take note of any potential embolic sources, such as atrial fibrillation or heart murmurs, that may provide a suggestion to the underlying cause Mesenteric ischaemia should always be considered in cases of acute abdomen, especially where there is no other obvious cause. Other causes of acute abdomen that may have similar presentations include peptic ulcer disease, bowel perforation, and symptomatic AAA Investigations Laboratory Tests An arterial blood gas (ABG) should be performed urgently, to assess the degree of acidosis and serum lactate, secondary to the severity of bowel infarction (however these can be normal, even in severe cases). Routine blood tests that should be performed, including FBC, U&Es, clotting (especially if patient anti-coagulated), amylase*, and LFTs (if the coeliac trunk is affected, ischaemia of the liver may cause derangement), as well as a group and save. *Whilst an amylase is commonly measured to exclude pancreatitis as a cause of the abdominal pain, counter-intuitively amylase also rises in mesenteric ischaemia, as well as ectopic pregnancy, bowel perforation, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Imaging The definitive diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischaemia, for both arterial and venous mesenteric disease, requires a CT scan with IV contrast (as a triple phase scan, with thin slices taken in the arterial phase) Arterial bowel ischaemia will initially show on CT imaging as oedematous bowel, secondary to the ischaemia and vasodilatation, before progressing to a loss of bowel wall enhancement* and then to pneumatosis. *Oral contrast should be avoided in cases of mesenteric ischaemia due to difficulty in assessing for bowel wall enhancement Definitive diagnosis is made via CT angiography Surgical treatment involves either bowel resection or revascularisation, however mortality rates are >50% even in treated cases Clinical edge: Acute pain and hypotension occur with rupture of the aneurysm, which requires an emergency operation. Acute severe pancreatitis and peptic ulcer perforation have no association with atrial fibrillation. They usually presents with pain over upper abdomen associated with guarding and rigidity on examination.</p>\n<p></p>",

The next step of the cardiac cycle is closure of the mitral and tricuspid wall resulting in first heart sound. The T wave on ECG represents ventricular repolarization that will be followed by ventricular diastole rapid ventricular filling which occurs later. Fig: A normal ECG trace (on the top) and Jugular venous (JV) pressure waveforms (on the bottom). In a normal JV pressure trace the R peak of the ECG signal happens between the a peak and the c peak of the JV waveform. The normal jugular venous pulse contains three positive waves. By convention these are labeled \" a,\" \"c\", and \"v\". These positive deflections occur, respectively, before the carotid upstroke and just after the P wave of the ECG (a wave) ; simultaneous with the upstroke of the carotid pulse (c wave); and during ventricular systole until the tricuspid valve opens (v wave). The a wave is generated by atrial contraction , which actively fills the right ventricle in end-diastole. The c wave is caused either by transmission of the carotid arterial impulse through the external and internal jugular veins or by the bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium in early systole. The v wave reflects the passive increase in pressure and volume of the right atrium as it fills in late systole and early diastole. Normally the crests of the a and v waves are approximately equal in amplitude. The descents or troughs of the jugular venous pulse occur between the \" a\" and \"c\" wave (\"x\" descent), between the \"c\" and \"v\" wave (\"x\" descent), and between the \"v\" and \"a\" wave (\"y\" descent). The x and x\u2032 descents reflect movement of the lower portion of the right atrium toward the right ventricle during the final phases of the ventricular systole. The y descent represents the abrupt termination of the down stroke of the v wave during early diastole after the tricuspid valve opens and the right ventricle begins to fill passively. Normally the y descent is neither as brisk nor as deep as the x descent.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Venous Pulse Carotid Pulse More lateral Wavy, Undulant Decrease with Inspiration Increase in supine position ^with abdominal pressure Double Peaked Obliterated with Pressure Better Visible Better viewed from foot end of bed Medial Forceful, Brisk No change No change No change Single Peak Cannot be Obliterated Better palpated</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Waveform Cardiac Condition Absent a wave Atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia Flutter waves Atrial flutter Prominent a waves First-degree atrioventricular block Large a waves Tricuspid stenosis, right atrial myxoma, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonic stenosis Cannon a waves Atrioventricular dissociation, ventricular tachycardia Absent x descent Tricuspid regurgitation Prominent x descent Conditions causing enlarged a waves Large cv waves Tricuspid regurgitation, constrictive percarditis Slow y descent Tricuspid stenosis, right atrial myxoma Rapid y descent Constrictive pericarditis, severe right heart failure, tricuspid regurgitation, atrial septal defect Absent y descent Cardiac tamponade</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1, 2, 3 is correct There are 5 critical components of high-quality CPR: minimize interruptions in chest compressions, provide compressions of adequate rate and depth, avoid leaning between compressions, and avoid excessive ventilation. Minimize Interruptions: CCF >80% For adequate tissue oxygenation, it is essential that healthcare providers minimize interruptions in chest compressions and therefore maximize the amount of time chest compressions generate blood flow. CCF is the proportion of time that chest compressions are performed during a cardiac arrest. The duration of arrest is defined as the time cardiac arrest is first identified until time of first return of sustained circulation. To maximize perfusion, the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC recommend minimizing pauses in chest compressions. Chest Compression Rate of 100 to 120/min The current Guidelines for CPR and ECC recommend a chest compression rate of \u2265100/min. As chest compression rates fall, a significant drop-off in ROSC occurs, and higher rates may reduce coronary blood flow and decrease the percentage of compressions that achieve target depth. Data from various studies provide the best evidence of association between compression rate and survival and suggest an optimum target of between 100 and 120 compressions per minute. Consistent rates above or below that range appear to reduce survival to discharge. Chest Compression Depth of \u226550 mm in Adults and at Least One Third the Anterior-Posterior Dimension of the Chest in Infants and Children Compressions generate critical blood flow and oxygen and energy delivery to the heart and brain. It is recommended that a single minimum depth for compressions of \u22652 inches (50 mm) in adults. Less information is available for children, but it is reasonable to aim for a compression depth of at least one third of the anterior-posterior dimension of the chest in infants and children (\u22481\u00bd inches, or 4 cm, in infants and \u22482 inches, or 5 cm, in children). Full Chest Recoil: No Residual Leaning Incomplete chest wall release occurs when the chest compressor does not allow the chest to fully recoil on completion of the compression. This can occur when a rescuer leans over the patient\u2019s chest, impeding full chest expansion. Leaning is known to decrease the blood flow throughout the heart and can decrease venous return and cardiac output. Avoid Excessive Ventilation: Rate <12 Breaths per Minute, Minimal Chest Rise Although oxygen delivery is essential during CPR, the appropriate timeframe for interventions to supplement existing oxygen in the blood is unclear and likely varies with the type of arrest (arrhythmic versus asphyxial). The metabolic demands for oxygen are also substantially reduced in the patient in arrest even during chest compressions. When sudden arrhythmic arrest is present, oxygen content is initially sufficient, and high-quality chest compressions can circulate oxygenated blood throughout the body. Studies in suggest that compressions without ventilations may be adequate early in non asphyxial arrests. When asphyxia is the cause of the arrest, the combination of assisted ventilation and high-quality chest compressions is critical to ensure sufficient oxygen delivery. Rate <12 Breaths per Minute Current guideline recommendations for ventilation rate (breaths per minute) are dependent on the presence of an advanced airway (8 to 10 breaths per minute), as well as the patient\u2019s age and the number of rescuers present (compression-to-ventilation ratio of 15:2 versus 30:2). When other recommended goals are achieved (ie, compression rate of 100 to 120/min, inflation time of 1 second for each breath), these ratios lead to ventilation rates of between 6 and 12 breaths per minute. Minimal Chest Rise: Optimal Ventilation Pressure and Volume Ventilation volume should produce no more than visible chest rise. Positive-pressure ventilation significantly lowers cardiac output in both spontaneous circulation and during CPR.57,62\u201365 Use of lower tidal volumes during prolonged cardiac arrest was not associated with significant differences in Pao266 and is currently recommended. 67 Additionally, positive-pressure ventilation in an unprotected airway may cause gastric insufflation and aspiration of gastric contents. Lung compliance is affected by compressions during cardiac arrest, 68 and the optimal inflation pressure is not known.</p>\n<p></p>",

Treatment for those with more severe disease often includes regular blood transfusions, iron chelation, and folic acid. Iron chelation may be done with deferoxamine, deferasirox or deferiprone. Occasionally, a bone marrow transplant may be an option. Complications may include iron overload from the transfusions with resulting heart or liver disease, infections, and osteoporosis.

Spirometry and the calculation of FEV1/FVC allows the identification of obstructive or restrictive ventilatory defects. A FEV1/FVC < 70 % where FEV1 is reduced more than FVC signifies an obstructive defect. Common examples of obstructive defects include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. The FEV1 can be expressed as a percentage of the predictive value which allows classification of the severity of the impairment. Even if the flow volume loop morphology is normal, a reduction in PEFR may be an indication of asthma with early airways obstruction. Similarly a reduction in FEF25-75% indicates small airways obstruction. This can also occur in patients with asthma with a normal PEFR, and is useful in providing a better overall picture of asthma control.

There may be contributing factors , such as:- cigarette smoke, family history, the rupture of the bulla (small air-filled sacs in the lung tissue) but these will not cause pneumothorax itself. A pneumothorax can further be classified as tension or non-tension pneumothorax. A tension pneumothorax is caused by excessive pressure build up around the lung due to a breach in the lung surface which will admit air into the pleural cavity during inspiration but will not allow any air to escape during expiration. The breach acts as a one-way valve . This leads to lung collapse. The removal of the air is through the surgical incision by inserting an underwater drain in the pleural cavity. This excessive pressure can also prevent the heart from pumping effectively which may lead to shock . A non-tension pneumothorax is not considered as severe as there is no ongoing accumulation of air and therefore there is no increased pressure on the organs and the chest.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Treatment options include: Conservative management with observation until the air is naturally resorbed by the body Simple aspiration Chest tube placement - Simple chest tube placement alone has a very high rate of recurrence (about 65%) in patients with LAM. Heimlich valve (HV) insertion - a lightweight one-way valve designed for the ambulatory treatment of pneumothorax (with an intercostal catheter) Pleurodesis through a chest tube - a procedure which obliterates the pleural space to prevent future pneumothoraces. Mechanical (using physical abrasion) Chemical (using talc, doxycycline, bleomycin or other agents). While chemical pleurodesis through a chest tube can be successful, this may result in incomplete pleurodesis due to the uneven distribution of the chemical. Surgery - Surgical treatment, using video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS), is the preferred approach. Wide bore needle in 5 th ICS followed by ICD/ Thoracostomy is the most appropriate approach for this patient in the emergency setting.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Spontaneous pneumothorax or primary spontaneous pneumothorax is characterized by having no clear cause or no known underlying lung pathology.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All Cases neurological impairment show macrocytosis Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord is a neurological complication of vitamin B12 deficiency. It is characterised by degeneration of the dorsal columns and the lateral columns of the spinal cord due to demyelination. It commonly presents with sensory deficits, paresthesia, weakness, ataxia, and gait disturbance. In severe untreated cases, it can lead to spasticity and paraplegia. It is crucial to promptly identify and treat vitamin B12 deficiency to prevent the development of this serious neurological complication. Demyelinating lesions initially appear in the center of the dorsal columns of the upper thoracic cord. The lesions then spread laterally to involve lateral corticospinal tracts and cranially involving the cervical cord and medulla. Subacute combined degeneration is treated with vitamin B12 supplementation, which can be administered by intramuscular, deep subcutaneous, oral, or sublingual routes. The most commonly used preparations are cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin. The dose of vitamin B12, route of administration, and duration of treatment depends on the presenting symptoms, the urgency of treatment, the underlying etiology, and the patient's preference. Patients with subacute combined degeneration require more aggressive and rapid treatment to prevent irreversible neurological deficits. Such patients are best treated by parenteral therapy, at least initially, and can be transitioned to oral therapy once the deficiency is corrected. Response to therapy is assessed by monitoring hematological markers and improvement in symptoms. Generally, markers of hemolysis decrease in one to two days, and Reticulocytosis occur within three to four days. This is followed by the improvement of anemia and the disappearance of hyper segmented neutrophils, which takes approximately two weeks. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia take three to four weeks to resolve. Vitamin B12 levels should also be monitored at regular intervals. Monitoring is conducted more frequently in patients with subacute combined degeneration and should be continued until a complete response has been elicited. While laboratory markers show rapid improvement, clinical improvement for neurological symptoms takes at least 3 to 12 months. In some cases, neurological deficits may be permanent and may not be reversible even with cobalamin supplementation.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>2 and 4 is correct The given Image shows a neuropathic lesion in the sole of foot. Neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes. Narrowing of blood vessels leads to delayed wound repair due to concomitant angiopathy in neuropathic etiologies. Absence of distal pulses due to obliteration of dorsalis pedis or other sites is seen in Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO). Arterial ulcers develop as the result of damage to the arteries due to lack of blood flow to tissue. Venous ulcers are usually seen over medial malleolus. In the normal venous system, pressure decreases with exercise as a result of the action of the calf muscle pump. When the muscles relax, the valves in the perforating veins connecting the superficial to the deep venous circulation prevent reflux and the pressure remains low. The venous pressure remains high, however, in a system where the valves are incompetent. Venous leg ulceration is due to sustained venous hypertension, which results from chronic venous insufficiency.

In vitamin B12 deficiency, there is an increased production of oxidants like homocysteine. This leads to relative glutathione depletion leading to the activation of the tyrosinase enzyme. This results in the increased synthesis of melanin leading to pigmentation particularly at knuckles and oral mucosa. Folic acid deficiency results in megaloblastic anemia associated with neurological symptoms. Fe deficiency results in hypochromic microcytic anemia with the hair, skin (pallor), and nail changes (koilonychia).

Diffuse axonal injury is the result of shearing forces , typically from rotational acceleration (most often a deceleration). Due to the slightly different specific gravities (relative mass per unit volume) of white and grey matter, shearing due to change in velocity has a predilection for axons at the grey-white matter junction , as the name implies. In the majority of cases, these forces result in damage to the cells and result in edema. MC location: Lobar white matter at the  junction of grey and white matter> Corpus callosum> Brain stem. Loss of consciousness is a common finding. MC cause of  post-traumatic vegetative state. Post-traumatic coma may last a considerable time and is often attributed to coexistent more visible injury (e.g. cerebral contusions). Raised ICT may or  may not be associated. MRI is  IOC for DAI (better than CT scan). The diagnosis is best made on MRI where it is characterized by several small regions of susceptibility artifact at the grey-white matter junction, in the corpus callosum , and in more severe cases in the brainstem, surrounded by FLAIR hyperintensity. Differential diagnosis On imaging consider: Cortical contusions The main differential in patients with head injuries Typically located superficially , involving the cortex (rather than at the grey-white matter junction) and are usually associated with variable amounts of extra-axial blood ( subarachnoid and subdural ) diffuse vascular injuries</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Clinical signs: \u2b07\ufe0f LOC \u2b06\ufe0f ICP Decerebration or Decortication Global cerebral edema Investigations Computed tomography (CT) Rarely detected on CT (20% of DAl lesions are hemorrhagic) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Can show more details than CT as detecting injury characteristics such as DAI X-rays Not much role Angiography : May be used to detect Blood vessel pathology.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Give steroids before Anti parasite agents Corticosteroids should be used immediately in patients with significant cerebral edema, mass effect, or vasculitis associated with neurocysticercosis . High doses (approximately 1 mg/kg/d of prednisone ) should be used. High-dose dexamethasone (30 mg/d) should be used initially to treat cysticercal encephalitis. If cerebral edema resolves , patients may be treated with antiparasitic drugs The clinical history of seizures and the autopsy findings of multiloculated cystic lesions are suggestive of neurocysticercosis caused by solium (Cysticercosis cellulosae). Glucocorticoid therapy is usually started before initiating albendazole (antiparasitic drug) and continued for several days after the institution of therapy to reduce the incidence of side effects from inflammatory reactions to dead and dying cysticerci of Taenia & Miura. Albendazole is the drug of choice for neurocysticercosis. For the treatment of patients with brain parenchymal cysticerci albendazole is given as 15 mg/kg per day for 8-28 days or praziquantel 50-100 mg/kg daily in three divided doses for 15-30 days. A combination of albendazole and praziquantel given as 50 mg/kg per day is more effective in patients with more than two cystic lesions.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>There are various types of cysticercosis based on the site affected such as:- Subcutaneous nodules (asymptomatic), Neurocysticercosis, Muscular cysticercosis, Ocular cysticercosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Neurocysticercosis is the most common central nervous system parasitic infection.

A few other causes can stem from inadequate dietary intake of calcium , a vitamin D deficiency, or steatorrhea. 85% of the cases of primary hyperparathyroidism are due to solitary parathyroid adenomas .

Raynaud disease is characterized by the occurrence of the vasospasm alone, with no association with another illness. Secondary Raynaud phenomenon is a designation usually used in the context of vasospasm associated with another illness, most commonly an autoimmune disease. In individuals with Raynaud phenomenon, one or more body parts experience intense vasospasm with associated color change and subsequent hyperemia . Patients often describe 3 phases of change with:- initial white ( vasoconstriction ), followed by blue ( cyanosis ), and then red ( rapid blood reflow ).
