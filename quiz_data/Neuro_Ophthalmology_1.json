It refers to the duration it takes for the eyes to adjust and regain optimal vision in low-light or dark conditions after being exposed to bright light. Dark adaptation occurs in two stages: Cone Adaptation : This occurs within the first 5 to 10 minutes . Rod Adaptation : Following cone adaptation, the rods (photoreceptor cells that are more sensitive than cones and better suited for low-light conditions) take over. This stage can take an additional 15 to 20 minutes, completing the process of dark adaptation. The rate of adaptation can vary based on factors such as age, the intensity of the preceding light exposure, and the individual's overall ocular health.
