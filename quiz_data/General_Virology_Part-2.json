      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hepatitis B virus This patient's fever and joint pain are nonspecific symptoms of a viral infection. Atypical (reactive) lymphocytes are also nonspecific and are seen with many viral infections (although Epstein-Barr and cytomegalovirus are usually present with the highest counts). Based on the described viral morphology, this patient is most likely infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV), a member of the DNA-containing Hepadnaviridae family. The mature virion (a Dane particle) consists of a hexagonal protein core (capsid) covered with a lipid bilayer envelope studded with proteins and carbohydrates. The HBV genome is a partially double-stranded circular DNA molecule housed within the capsid. After the virion enters the cell, the capsid is released into the cytoplasm, and the viral genome is transferred into the nucleus. The viral DNA is then repaired to form a fully double-stranded circular minichromosome that can be transcribed into viral mRNAs. The genome replicates within a newly synthesized capsid containing the full-length viral mRNA transcript. Reverse transcriptase (which has both RNA and DNA-dependent DNA-polymerase activity) acts on this RNA template to create a single-stranded DNA intermediate that is converted back into circular, partially double-stranded DNA. The mature capsid is then enveloped by a portion of the endoplasmic reticulum containing virally-encoded proteins to form the completed virion.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The complete hepatitis B virion is called the Dane particle . It is a DNA virus of the Hepadna family and consists of an outer envelope and core. The core is formed in the hepatocyte nucleus.

Coxsackie virus is within the Picornaviridae family and comprises an icosahedral nucleocapsid and a + single-stranded RNA genome. The RNA has a protein on the 5' end that acts as a primer for transcription by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Option B & C. Cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus are members of the Herpesviridae family. All viruses within this family contain an icosahedral core surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope and have double-stranded, linear DNA. These are the only viruses to acquire their envelopes by budding from the nuclear membrane.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Differences between bacterial & viral meningitis Viral Bacterial Common microbes \u25cf       Enteroviruses, \u25cf       Arboviruses, \u25cf       Herpes Simplex virus type 2 \u25cf       Adults: Streptococcus pneumonia & Neisseria meningitidis \u25cf       Neonates: Group B Streptococcus & & gram- negative bacilli CSF cell differential \u25cf       WBC count often <500 cells/mm3 \u25cf       Lymphocytic predominance \u25cf       WBC count often >1000 cells/mm3 \u25cf       Neutrophilic predominance CSF glucose & protein \u25cf       Glucose levels are normal or slightly reduced \u25cf       Protein generally <150 mg/dl \u25cf       Glucose levels <45 mg/dl \u25cf       Protein is often >250 mg/dl CSF Gram stain & culture \u25cf       No organisms identified \u25cf       Often positive for a specific organism</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>HBeAg Vertical transmission of hepatitis B from pregnant females to the unborn child can occur with active hepatitis B infection. Such transmission typically occurs during the fetus's passage through the birth canal, but transplacental infection can also occur. This is especially common in those women who develop acute hepatitis B infection in the third trimester. The presence of HBeAg (a soluble protein marker of viral replication and increased infectivity) in the mother significantly increases the risk of vertical transmission of the virus. Were this woman HBeAg negative, her neonate's risk of infection would be 20%? However, if she were HBeAg positive, her neonate's disease risk would be 95%. Moreover, if the infant becomes infected, his chance of progressing to chronic hepatitis is 90%. Because of this concern, the newborns of all mothers with active hepatitis B are passively immunized at birth with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), followed by active immunization with recombinant HBV vaccine.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. HBcAg is not detectable in serum as it is usually sequestrated within the HBsAg coat. Option: B. HBsAg is the first virological marker detected in the serum after inoculation, preceding the elevation of serum aminotransferases and the onset of clinical symptoms. It remains detectable during the entire symptomatic phase of acute hepatitis B and suggests infectivity. It is not the most ominous marker in the pregnant woman, however. Option: D. Anti-HBc appears in the serum shortly after the emergence of HBsAg and remains detectable long after the patient recovers. The IgM fraction signals the acute phase of the disease, whereas the IgG fraction signals recovery from the illness. Because IgM anti-HBc is present in the \"window period,\" it is an essential tool for diagnosis when HBsAg has been cleared and anti-HBs are not yet detectable. Thus, IgM anti-HBc is the most specific marker for diagnosing acute hepatitis B.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>WNV When a mosquito bites an infected bird, the virus enters the mosquito's bloodstream and eventually moves into its salivary glands. When an infected mosquito bites an animal or a human (host), the virus is passed into the host's bloodstream, where it may cause serious illness. West Nile virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that causes West Nile fever. It is a member of the family Flaviviridae, specifically from the genus Flavivirus, which also contains the Zika virus, dengue virus, and yellow fever virus. West Nile virus is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, mostly species of Culex. Arbovirus is an informal name used to refer to any viruses that are transmitted by arthropod vectors. The word arbovirus is an acronym (arthropod-borne virus). Viruses transmitted by an arthropod vector can cause CNS infections, undifferentiated febrile illness, acute polyarthropathy, and hemorrhagic fevers. West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of domestically acquired arboviral disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. Japanese encephalitis (JE) flavivirus is closely related to West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis viruses. The JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culex species mosquitoes, particularly Culex tritaeniorhynchus. The virus is maintained in a cycle between mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts, primarily pigs and wading birds. Humans are incidental or dead-end hosts because they usually do not develop high enough concentrations of JE virus in their bloodstreams to infect feeding mosquitoes. JE virus transmission occurs primarily in rural agricultural areas, often associated with rice production and flooding irrigation. In some regions of Asia, these conditions can occur near urban centers. Option C.</p>\n<p></p>",

This species of Taenia may occasionally cause human disease resembling cysticercosis. The definitive host is wolves/ dogs/foxes, and the intermediate host is sheep/ cattle/ horses. Humans become intermediate hosts when they ingest food/water contaminated with feces containing T. multiceps eggs.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A.
