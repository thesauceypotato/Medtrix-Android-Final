A) Anovulation</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Anovulation is the most common cause of puberty menorrhagia. Menorrhagia refers to heavy menstrual bleeding that occurs in a regular cycle. In adolescents, anovulation, which is the failure of the ovary to release an oocyte during a menstrual cycle, frequently leads to heavy or prolonged bleeding due to the lack of a normal hormonal cycle that regulates the endometrial lining. Without the usual cyclical hormonal fluctuations, the endometrial lining may become excessively thick, leading to heavy bleeding when it sheds. This condition is typical in puberty due to the body's ongoing adjustment to hormonal regulation.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Endometriosis : Endometriosis involves the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which can cause painful menstruation and potentially contribute to menorrhagia. However, it is less common than anovulation as the primary cause of menorrhagia in adolescents.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Endometriosis</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Malignancy : Malignancy is a rare cause of menorrhagia in puberty. While malignancy can lead to abnormal bleeding, it is not the most common cause in this age group.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Malignancy</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Decreased risk of breast cancer: This option is incorrect. HRT, particularly with estrogen and progestin, is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Long-term use of combined HRT has been shown to elevate the risk of breast cancer in several studies.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Decreased risk of breast cancer:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Decreased risk of endometrial cancer: This option is incorrect. Unopposed estrogen (estrogen alone without progestin) increases the risk of endometrial cancer.

A) At eight weeks the embryo is bipotent</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 At eight weeks of gestation, the embryo is no longer bipotent. The term \"bipotent\" refers to the embryo's capability to develop into either male or female structures, which is true up until about the sixth week of development. By the eighth week, sexual differentiation is already underway, with the influence of the SRY gene causing the gonads to differentiate into testes in 46XY embryos. This differentiation results in a shift away from bipotency, making the embryo committed to developing male characteristics.</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Wolffian duct develops into epididymis and vas deferens on either side of the body : This statement is true. The Wolffian ducts, under the influence of testosterone, develop into the male reproductive structures including the epididymis and vas deferens.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Wolffian duct develops into epididymis and vas deferens on either side of the body</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Mullerian inhibiting substance inhibits Mullerian duct : This statement is true. Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS), also known as anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), is produced by Sertoli cells in the testes and inhibits the development of the Mullerian ducts, which would otherwise develop into female reproductive structures such as the uterine tubes and uterus.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Mullerian inhibiting substance inhibits Mullerian duct</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Dihydrotestosterone leads to the development of secondary sexual characters and external genitalia : This statement is true. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent metabolite of testosterone, is crucial for the development of male external genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics such as facial hair and a deeper voice.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Prolonged exposure to high FiO\u2082 levels increases the risk of oxygen toxicity and absorption atelectasis. Therefore, FiO\u2082 should be reduced below 60% once oxygenation is adequate. The elevated PaCO\u2082 (58 mmHg) with a near-normal pH (7.33) reflects compensated respiratory acidosis, which is acceptable in the context of lung-protective ventilation strategies. In ARDS, permissive hypercapnia is an accepted approach where mild-to-moderate CO\u2082 retention is tolerated to avoid volutrauma and barotrauma from high tidal volumes or aggressive ventilation. Thus, reducing FiO\u2082 is safer and more appropriate than increasing tidal volume.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
