So due to its paralysis the hand assumes a clawed appearance reflecting the unopposed action of the long flexors and extensors of the fingers. There is slowly progressive weakness which usually starts in the small muscles of the hand (T1)and spreads to involve the finger flexors (C8). There is sensory loss on the medial aspect of the forearm (T1) extending into the medial side of the hand and to the little finger (C8). There is a slow insidious onset of wasting of the small muscles of the hand, which often starts on the lateral side with involvement of the thenar eminence and first dorsal interosseous. There is pain and paraesthesia in the medial aspect of the forearm extending to the little finger, and this is often aggravated by carrying weight. There is often an associated horner's syndrome (ptosis and constriction of the pupil) which occurs as a result of pull or traction of the cervical sympathetic chain.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.

It crosses the quadrangular space and comes to lie on the medial side of the surgical neck of the humerus, medial and inferior to the capsule of the shoulder joint. Here it divides into anterior and posterior branches. The posterior branch supplies the teres minor and posterior part of the deltoid and terminates as the cutaneous nerve which supplies the skin over the lower-half of the deltoid.
