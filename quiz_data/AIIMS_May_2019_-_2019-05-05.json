Contralateral hemiplegia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The structure marked in the image is the pyramid containing the pyramidal tracts. A lesion here leads to contralateral hemiplegia.</li><li>\u2022 This is because the fibers of these tracts decussate (cross over) in the medulla oblongata. Thus, an injury to the pyramidal tract on one side of the brain or upper spinal cord will affect motor function on the opposite side of the body.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Ataxia : Ataxia refers to uncoordinated movement and is typically related to damage to the cerebellum or sensory pathways, not the pyramidal tracts. The cerebellum plays a crucial role in fine-tuning motor movements and ensuring coordination. So, an injury to the pyramidal tracts does not typically result in ataxia.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.</li><li>\u2022 Ataxia</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Tinnitus : Tinnitus is the perception of noise or ringing in the ears. It's a symptom of an underlying condition, such as age-related hearing loss, ear injury, or a circulatory system disorder. Injury to the pyramidal tracts would not lead to tinnitus, as they are primarily motor tracts and not involved in auditory processing or function.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.</li><li>\u2022 Tinnitus</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Ipsilateral facial palsy : Facial palsy refers to weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face. It is most commonly associated with damage to the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). While the pyramidal tracts do play a role in voluntary facial movements, a direct injury to these tracts would not typically lead to ipsilateral facial palsy. Furthermore, facial movements are controlled by both sides of the brain, so an isolated pyramidal tract lesion might not manifest as overt facial weakness.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.</li><li>\u2022 Ipsilateral facial palsy</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The pyramids in the medulla oblongata, containing the pyramidal tracts, are crucial for voluntary motor control. A lesion here can lead to contralateral hemiplegia due to the crossing over of these tracts within the medulla. This understanding is essential for diagnosing and understanding the implications of brainstem injuries, especially in the context of stroke or other neurological disorders.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. D. Attached to pelvic brim</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The levator ani is not attached to the pelvic brim. Instead, it originates from the posterior surface of the body of the pubis, the obturator fascia, and the ischial spine. It then inserts into the coccyx, anococcygeal ligament, and walls of the prostate or vagina, rectum, and anal canal. The incorrect notion about its attachment to the pelvic brim is a common misconception.</li><li>\u2022 Insertion :- The coccyx and the anococcygeal raphe or ligament. Nerve supply:- The branches of the anterior rami of sacral nerves S3 and S4 and the perineal branch of the pudendal nerve. Supports and raises the pelvic floor. Consists of the puborectalis, pubococcygeus, and iliococcygeus.</li><li>\u2022 Insertion :- The coccyx and the anococcygeal raphe or ligament.</li><li>\u2022 Insertion :-</li><li>\u2022 Nerve supply:- The branches of the anterior rami of sacral nerves S3 and S4 and the perineal branch of the pudendal nerve.</li><li>\u2022 Nerve supply:-</li><li>\u2022 Supports and raises the pelvic floor.</li><li>\u2022 Consists of the puborectalis, pubococcygeus, and iliococcygeus.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A . Supports pelvic viscera : This statement is correct. The levator ani, along with other pelvic floor muscles, forms a supportive sling for the pelvic organs such as the bladder, uterus (in females), and rectum. This muscular support is essential for maintaining continence and facilitating functions such as micturition and defecation.</li><li>\u2022 Option A</li><li>\u2022 Supports pelvic viscera</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Converge downwards and medially : This statement is also correct. The fibers of the levator ani muscles, especially from the pubococcygeus, tend to converge towards the midline and run in a downward direction. This orientation provides the necessary support to the pelvic organs and creates a muscular barrier between the pelvic cavity and the perineum.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.</li><li>\u2022 Converge downwards and medially</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Consists of iliococcygeus and pubococcygeus : This statement is partially true. The levator ani is made up of three parts: the puborectalis, pubococcygeus, and iliococcygeus. All three parts contribute to the function and support provided by the levator ani. Thus, while the statement includes two components of the levator ani, it omits the puborectalis.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.</li><li>\u2022 Consists of iliococcygeus and pubococcygeus</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The pelvic brim is not connected to the levator ani muscle.

Wrist drop</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The structure marked in the image is the radial nerve demonstrated in the cubital fossa. A lesion of the radial nerve leads to a wrist drop. Injury to the radial nerve leads to paralysis of the extensor muscles of the wrist and fingers. This results in an inability to extend the wrist and fingers actively, leading to the characteristic \"wrist drop\" appearance. The hand hangs flaccidly with the fingers flexed, and the person cannot extend them</li><li>\u2022 Anterior view of the right cubital fossa:</li><li>\u2022 The structures marked in the given image are:</li><li>\u2022 Branch of the median nerve to the brachialis muscle Biceps brachii muscle Brachialis muscle Lateral cutaneous nerve of fore arm Superficial branch of the radial nerve Brachioradialis muscle Flexor carpi ulnaris muscle Pronator teres muscle Brachial artery Medial cutaneous nerve of forearm Median nerve.</li><li>\u2022 Branch of the median nerve to the brachialis muscle</li><li>\u2022 Biceps brachii muscle</li><li>\u2022 Brachialis muscle</li><li>\u2022 Lateral cutaneous nerve of fore arm</li><li>\u2022 Superficial branch of the radial nerve</li><li>\u2022 Brachioradialis muscle</li><li>\u2022 Flexor carpi ulnaris muscle</li><li>\u2022 Pronator teres muscle</li><li>\u2022 Brachial artery</li><li>\u2022 Medial cutaneous nerve of forearm</li><li>\u2022 Median nerve.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Ape thumb deformity : This deformity is primarily associated with the median nerve lesion. It refers to an inability to oppose or flex the thumb due to weakness or paralysis of the thenar muscles (especially the opponens pollicis), which are innervated by the median nerve. This results in a flattened thenar eminence, giving the thumb an appearance reminiscent of an ape's thumb.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Ape thumb deformity</li><li>\u2022 Option B . Claw hand : Claw hand, or \"clawing\" of the fingers, usually results from a combined ulnar and median nerve lesion. It is characterized by hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and flexion at the interphalangeal (IP) joints. It can also result from a high ulnar nerve lesion on its own. The claw hand deformity is not a typical consequence of radial nerve injury.</li><li>\u2022 Option B</li><li>\u2022 Claw hand</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Claudication : Claudication refers to pain, cramping, or fatigue in muscles, typically the calves, during walking or exercise. It's a symptom of peripheral arterial disease, where there's reduced blood flow to the legs. This is not related to radial nerve injury.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.</li><li>\u2022 Claudication</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
