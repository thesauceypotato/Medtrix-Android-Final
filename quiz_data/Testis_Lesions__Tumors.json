Poor sperm quality : Men with TDS may have poor semen quality, including low sperm count, decreased sperm motility, and abnormal sperm morphology. Leydig cell hypoplasia: A rare genetic disorder that affects the production of testosterone by the Leydig cells in the testes. Testicular germ cell tumours : Men with TDS have an increased risk of developing testicular germ cells tumours such as seminoma and non-seminoma.
