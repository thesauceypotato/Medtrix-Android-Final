      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Verapamil</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Verapamil and diltiazem should be avoided with beta-blockers because both cause myocardial depression leading to marked depression of the myocardium. Also, additive sinus depression, conduction defects, or asystole may occur. i.v. Verapamil carries the risk of marked bradycardia, A-V block, cardiac arrest, and hypotension. It should not be used if PSVT is accompanied by hypotension or CHF and in patients who have received beta-blockers.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A . Nifedipine is a medicine used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and to prevent angina (heart-related chest pain). It belongs to a class of medicines known as calcium channel blockers. It lowers blood pressure and reduces the workload of the heart. This helps prevent heart attacks and strokes. Option: C. ACE inhibitors were initially approved for the treatment of hypertension and can be used alone or in combination with other anti-hypertensive medications. Later, they were found helpful for other cardiovascular and kidney diseases, including Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and Heart failure.</p>\n<p></p>",

The NO-dependent relaxation of vascular smooth muscle leads to vasodilation. NO-mediated guanylyl cyclase activation inhibits platelet aggregation and relaxes the smooth muscle in the bronchi and GI tract.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. c GMP: is a cyclic nucleotide derived from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). cGMP acts as a second messenger, much like cyclic AMP. Its most likely mechanism of action is the activation of intracellular protein kinases in response to the binding of membrane-impermeable peptides. Option: D. c AMP: is a second messenger, or cellular signal occurring within cells, that is important in many biological processes. cAMP is a derivative of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and used for intracellular signal transduction in many different organisms, conveying the cAMP-dependent pathway.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#Mantra</p>\n<p></p>",

PSVT is a type of supraventricular tachycardia named for its intermittent abrupt onset and termination episodes. Often people have no symptoms. Otherwise, symptoms may include palpitations, increased heart rate, lightheadedness, sweating, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Option: D. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is when the heart thickens without an obvious cause. The parts of the heart most commonly affected are the interventricular septum and the ventricles. This results in the heart being less able to pump blood effectively</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#Mantra Verapamil Is relatively selective for the myocardium, and\nis less effective as a systemic vasodilator drug. This drug has a very\nimportant role in treating angina (by reducing myocardial oxygen demand and\nreversing coronary vasospasm) and arrhythmias. Diltiazem Is intermediate between verapamil and\ndihydropyridines in its selectivity for vascular calcium channels. By having\nboth cardiac depressant and vasodilator actions, diltiazem is able to reduce\narterial pressure without producing the same degree of reflex cardiac\nstimulation caused by dihydropyridines</p>\n<p></p>",

Procainamide is an alternative agent when the abovementioned drugs are either not tolerated or ineffective.
