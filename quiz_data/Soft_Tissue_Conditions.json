Treatment includes Achilles and local plantar fascial stretching , cushioning of the heel, and night splints. Resistant cases may benefit from shockwave therapy or surgical release with plantar fasciotomy. PLANTAR FASCITIS This is a common cause of pain in the heel. It occurs as a result of inflammation of the plantar aponeurosis at its attachment on the tuberosity of the calcaneum (Fig-36.6). The pain is worst early in the morning, and often improves with activity. On examination, there is marked tenderness over the medial aspect of the calcaneal tuberosity, at the site of attachment of the plantar fascia. X-rays sometimes show a sharp bone spur projecting forwards from the tuberosity of the calcaneum. Its significance is doubtful since it is also found in some cases without heel pain. Analgesics, the use of a heel pad and local induction of steroids brings relief in most cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B.
