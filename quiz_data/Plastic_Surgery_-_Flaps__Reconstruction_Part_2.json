Random flaps : Three sides of a rectangle, bearing no specific relationship to where the blood supply enters; the length-to-breadth ratio is no more than 1.5:1. This pattern can be lengthened by \u2018delaying\u2019 the flap, a process in which the cuts are partially made and the flap is partly lifted at a first operation; it is then replaced, thus \u2018training\u2019 the blood supply from a single border of the rectangle. In a second procedure, it is raised further and finally transferred. Option: B. Axial flaps. Much longer flaps are based on known blood vessels supplying the skin. This technique was rediscovered in the 1960s and 1970s and enables many long thin flaps to be safely moved across large distances. Option: D. Free flaps . The blood supply has been isolated, disconnected, and then reconnected using microsurgery at the new site. Composite flaps. Various tissues are transferred together, often skin with bone or muscle (osteocutaneous or myocutaneous flaps, respectively). Perforator flaps. This description refers to a whole new subgroup of axial flaps, in which tissues are isolated on small perforating vessels that run from more major blood vessels to supply the surface.</p>\n<p></p>",

Colloid resuscitation: Human albumin solution (HAS) is a commonly used colloid . Plasma proteins are responsible for the inward oncotic pressure that counteracts the outward capillary hydrostatic pressure. Without proteins, plasma volumes would not be maintained as there would be edema. Proteins should be given after the first 12 hours of burn because, before this time, the massive fluid shifts cause proteins to leak out of the cells. The most common colloid-based formula is the Muir and Barclay formula: 5 \u00d7 percentage body surface area burnt \u00d7 weight = one portion ; periods of 4/4/4, 6/6 and 12 hrs respectively; one portion to be given in each period.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The Muir and Barclay formula is widely used to calculate the necessary amount of fluid infusion during the initial 36 hours after a burn injury, making it the most prevalent colloid-based formula .
