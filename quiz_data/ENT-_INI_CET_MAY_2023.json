It innervates the lacrimal sac, inner canthus, and lateral aspect of the nose. To block the infratrochlear nerve, the needle is inserted just above the medial canthal ligament along the medial wall of the orbit to a depth of 1.0 cm. If performing local anesthesia for dacryocystorhinostomy, the anterior ethmoidal nerve with its distal external nasal branch should be blocked using the same procedure but to a depth of 2.0 cm posterior to the anterior lacrimal crest.

The pathway involves several stages and nuclei within the central nervous system. Here\u2019s a simplified sequence of the auditory pathway: Outer Ear: Sound waves enter the ear and travel through the external auditory canal to reach the eardrum (tympanic membrane). Middle Ear: Sound waves cause the eardrum to vibrate, which, in turn, causes the ossicles (tiny bones) in the middle ear (malleus, incus, and stapes) to vibrate. Inner Ear (Cochlea): Fluid movement within the cochlea stimulates hair cells located in the spiral-shaped organ of Corti. Hair cell stimulation generates electrical signals that are sent along the auditory nerve (cranial nerve VIII) to the brainstem. Cochlear Nucleus (Brainstem): The auditory nerve fibers synapse at the cochlear nucleus in the brainstem. Neurons in the cochlear nucleus process and relay auditory information to higher brain centers. Superior Olivary Complex- Brainstem: Information from both ears is compared and integrated to localize sound sources. This complex is involved in sound localization. Lateral Lemniscus: Auditory signals continue to ascend through the brainstem via the lateral lemniscus, which connects various brainstem nuclei. Inferior Colliculus: The auditory pathway reaches the inferior colliculus in the midbrain. Thisstructure isimportant for further processing of auditory information and routing it to different brain regions. Medial Geniculate Nucleus- Thalamus: From the inferior colliculus, auditory signals are relayed to the thalamus, specifically the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). Primary Auditory Cortex-Temporal Lobe: Finally, the processed auditory signals are transmitted from the thalamus to the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex. The primary auditory cortex is responsible for the conscious perception of sound.</p>\n<p></p>",
