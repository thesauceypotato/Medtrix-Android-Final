The tumours are universally associated with a mutation in the tyrosine kinase c-kit oncogene . They originate from pacemaker cells of the stomach (Cells of Cajal). These tumours are sensitive to the tyrosine kinase antagonist imatinib, and an 80% objective response rate can be observed. They show CD 117 and CD 34 IHC markers. Size > 5 cm and mitotic index are the best predictors of metastasis . Peritoneal and liver metastases are most common but spread to lymph nodes is extremely rare. Many GISTs are noticed incidentally at endoscopy or diagnosed if the overlying mucosa ulcerates with bleeding and anaemia. If easily resectable surgery is the primary mode of treatment. Smaller tumours can be treated by wedge excision.
