In this case, the patient's strict vegetarian diet without supplementation, combined with possible COVID-related reduced absorption, puts them at high risk for B12 deficiency.

These spots are a distinctive sign observed during eye examinations. Additionally, individuals with Tay-Sachs disease often experience progressive neurological deterioration, including muscle weakness, loss of motor skills, and seizures. There is also a characteristic decline in cognitive function, leading to intellectual and developmental disability.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>\u21b3 Reference : Harper\u2019s 31 st ed/pg- 235</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
