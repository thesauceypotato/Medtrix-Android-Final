Pachymetry - \"A pachymetry is a simple, quick, and painless examination used to measure the thickness of the cornea \" It has different applications in daily clinical practice, such as a complimentary examination in glaucoma, to determine potential refractive surgery or even to diagnose certain diseases of the cornea. Option: B. Tonometer - Tonometry is a test to measure the pressure inside your eyes . The test is used to screen for glaucoma and to measure how well glaucoma treatment is working. People over the age of 40 years, particularly African Americans, have the highest risk of developing glaucoma. Regular eye exams can help detect glaucoma early. Option D. Tomography Tonography is a clinical test of aqueous humor dynamics that was introduced by Morton Grant in 1950 Grant showed that analysis of a continuous recording from an electronic Schiotz tonometer yielded estimates of aqueous outflow and rate of aqueous flow. The principle of the test may be traced to the massage effect whereby pressure on the eye leads to a softening of the globe due to an increased outflow of aqueous humor induced by the higher pressure. Grant recorded the output of an electronic tonometer on a strip- chart recorder. Options A, B, and D are not the correct options.</p>\n<p></p>",
