The affected eye is displaced laterally by the lateral rectus and inferiorly by the superior oblique. The eye adopts a position known as \u2018down and out\u2019. The Trochlear nerve (CN IV) \u2013 A lesion of CN IV will paralyse the superior oblique muscle. There is no obvious effect of the resting orientation of the eyeball. However, the patient will complain of diplopia (double vision) and may develop a head tilt away from the site of the lesion.
