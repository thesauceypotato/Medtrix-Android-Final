      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>H+ stimulates peripheral chemoreceptors. A common mistake is thinking that elevated CO2 produced by the reaction of the acid with bicarbonate is the stimulus for ventilation. On the contrary, as soon as the peripheral chemoreceptors sense an increase in the H+, there will be an immediate increase in the rate of ventilation . Physiologically, metabolic acidosis or an initial decrease in pH (an increase in H+) stimulates the peripheral chemoreceptors, resulting in hyperventilation. Hyperventilation leads to a compensatory fall in PCO2.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Chemoreceptors located centrally and in the periphery respond to changes in arterial pH and PCO2 with input to the respiratory center that causes compensatory changes in breathing. Peripheral chemoreceptors are located in the carotid bodies and the aortic bodies and detect changes in pH, O2, and to a lesser extent PCO2. Central chemoreceptors located on the medulla are separated from the blood by the blood-brain barrier. These receptors are bathed by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is essentially a pure bicarbonate buffer.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Hyperventilation lowers the alveolar PCO2, which lowers the arterial PCO2. This is the appropriate compensatory response because the initial perturbation was a decrease in the bicarbonate concentration from the acid insult. From the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, it is apparent that a fall in the bicarbonate concentration can be compensated most rapidly by a proportionate fall in CO2.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Respiratory center: Located in the reticular formation of the medulla it is responsible for maintaining a rhythmic cycle of breathing and inte grating neural input from a variety of receptors (e.g. central and peripheral chemoreceptors) to adjust the rate and depth of breathing in response to perturbations in environmental or physical conditions. Central chemoreceptors: Located in the ventrolateral surface of the medulla directly respond to a change in the pH of the CSF, however, since the blood-brain barrier is impermeable to either H+ or HCO3-, these receptors detect changes in the arterial PCO2. Peripheral chemoreceptors: Located on the carotid and aortic bodies these receptors respond directly to changes in the arterial pH, PCO2, and PO2. CO2 / HCO3- buffering system: The central buffering system in the body for maintaining H+ homeostasis. The importance of this buffering system is the ability to control the arterial PCO2 by pulmonary function and [HCO3-] through renal function to compensate for acid-base disturbances.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Respiratory\n  center component Primary\n  function Pre-B\u00f6tzinger\n  complex Pacemaker\n  cells of spontaneous or automatic breathing Dorsal\n  Respiratory Group(DRG) Respiratory\n  rhythm generator (inspiratory ramp signal) Ventral\n  Respiratory Group (VRG) Overdrive\n  mechanism Pneumotaxic\n  centre Controls\n  the \"switch off\" point of inspiratory ramp signal Apneustic\n  centre Delays\n  switch off signal- promotes inspiration Vagi Inhibits\n  inspiratory discharge</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Decreased arterial PCO2 The partial pressure of oxygen decreases with increasing altitude. Rapid ascent to high altitude can result in hypoxia. Hypoxia stimulates pulmonary ventilation to increase alveolar PO2. A consequence of the hyperventilation is to decrease the PCO2 or hypocapnia. The fall in CO2 shifts the equilibrium of the CO2/HCO3- buffer system to decrease the H+, resulting in respiratory alkalosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The main buffer system in the body is the CO /HCO3\u2212 buffering system. One of its components, CO2, is controlled by the ventilatory rate; therefore, one of the most effective ways of compensating for an acid or base disturbance is to alter the [CO2] in the blood. Increasing H+ stimulates ventilation, which lowers CO2. Conversely, a fall in [H+] slows ventilation, resulting in a rise in [CO2].</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The concentration of CO2 in the blood is controlled by the alveolar PCO2. Hyperventilation decreases the PCO2, and hypoventilation increases the PCO2. Raising the arterial [CO2] causes a hyperventilation with a compensatory decrease, and lowering the [CO2] causes hypoventilation.</p>\n<p></p>",
