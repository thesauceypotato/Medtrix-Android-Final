Can also involve the face . Histopathological findings: Discrete lymphohistiocytic infiltrate expanding 1 - 4 dermal papillae Epidermal collarette gives the classic ball and claw appearance (90% of cases) Multinucleated giant cells (foreign body or Touton-type ) often present Overlying hyperkeratosis with or without parakeratosis is seen. Basal layer vacuolation and colloid bodies may be prominent</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Molluscum contagiosum (water warts): It is a common viral skin infection characterized by dome-shaped, umbilicated, round, and pinkish-purple in colour papules. The causative organism is a double-stranded DNA poxvirus called molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) which is transmitted by direct skin-to-skin (including sexual) or indirect contact. Option B. Follicular eczema: Atopic dermatitis that affects the hair follicle. Option C. Flat warts: (Juvenile warts): These are smooth, flat-topped, flesh- or brownish-yellow-coloured bumps the size of a pinhead, commonly found on the face, back of the hands, or legs, and tend to appear in large numbers. They are caused by benign strains of HPV types 3, 10, 28, and 49.</p>\n<p></p>",
