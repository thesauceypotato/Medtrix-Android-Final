Two patients both described as having depressed affect can be very different if one is described as mildly depressed and the other as severely depressed. The range can be restricted, normal, or labile .  The flat is a term that has been used for a severely restricted range of affect that is described in some patients with schizophrenia.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Affect is often described with the following elements: Quality Quantity Range Appropriateness Option: B. Speech is often an important clue to  the assessment of affect but it is not exclusive. Option: D. Appropriateness of affect refers to how the affect correlates to the patient who is laughing at a solemn moment of a funeral service and is described as having an inappropriate affect. Affect can also be congruent or incongruent with the patient's described mood or thought content. A patient may report feeling depressed or describe a depressive theme but do so with laughter, smiling, and no suggestion of sadness.</p>\n<p></p>",
