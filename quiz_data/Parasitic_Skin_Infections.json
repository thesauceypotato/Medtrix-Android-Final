Antibody avidity describes the strength with which an antibody binds to a complex antigen. Several methods have been described for determining relative antibody avidity to different types of antigens. The IgG avidity test measures antibody binding force, which is low in the early stage after primary infection but generally increases with time . This helps in identifying whether the infection was recent or remote and therefore the chances of the fetus being infected can be accessed better. High toxoplasma IgG avidity indicates that an infection likely occurred at least 3-4 months earlier In the diagnosis of congenital infections, IgM testing is unreliable as this antibody may persist for a longer period and may also be increased in reactivation of this disease.
