A leash of vessels connects the small lobe with the main lobe . Many times, succenturiate is retained and it presents as postpartum hemorrhage which may be primary or secondary. The Placenta membranacea is unduly large and thin . The placenta develops from both chorion frondosum and chorion laeve. It increases the chances of placenta previa, retained placenta, PPH. In placenta accreta , all or part of the placenta attaches abnormally to the myometrium.

Consequently, the vagina, cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes develop normally and the internal and external genitalia do not masculinize. In approximately 10\u201315% of patients, the disorder results from an inactivating mutation in the SRY gene, but in most, no cause can be identified. Patients with Swyer syndrome generally present after the expected time of puberty with delayed sexual maturation, primary amenorrhea, normal pubic hair, and normal female internal and external genital anatomy. Evaluation reveals hypogonadotropic hypogonadism , prompting a karyotype that establishes the diagnosis. Gonadectomy is indicated soon after diagnosis due to the significant risk for the development of germ cell tumours in occult testicular elements (20\u201330%). Kallmann syndrome: Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism resulting in delayed or absent puberty. They also have an additional symptom of lack or reduced sense of smell. CAH: Most commonly it is due to a deficiency of 21-hydroxylase enzyme. Pathophysiology relates primarily to decreased cortisol production, which stimulates a compensatory increase in pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion, causing adrenal hyperplasia; increased levels of steroid hormones proximal to the enzyme block seek an alternative metabolic pathway, resulting in increased production of androgens. Females with classical 21-hydroxylase deficiency (both salt-wasting and simple virilising forms) present at birth with ambiguous genitalia (adrenogenital syndrome). Females with the non-classical \u201clate-onset\u201d form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency have normal external genitalia and present later, during childhood or early adolescence , with precocious puberty, or as young adults with other signs of hyperandrogenism such as hirsutism.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options B, C and D are false.</p>\n<p></p>",

Doppler shows absent blood flow during diastole in the brain.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>In a normal situation, the fetal MCA has a high resistance flow which means there is minimal antegrade flow in fetal diastole. In pathological states, this can turn into a low resistance flow mainly as a result of the fetal head-sparing theory. Paradoxically in some situations such as with severe cerebral edema, the flow can revert back to a high resistance pattern when the pathology has not yet been resolved - this is a very poor prognostic sign. In the above case, the baby is having fetal distress and absent diastolic flow in MCA, so immediate delivery should be planned. But immediate delivery of the baby at 28 weeks will lead to high neonatal morbidity and mortality. There will be higher chances of RDS, EC, IVH, hyperbilirubinemia, prolonged NICU stay of the baby, polycythemia, and neonatal death. So steroid cover should be given, and the baby should be monitored till the Dexamethasone cover and then termination can be planned.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Start the next cycle of tablets from the next day</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mala-N: (Combined Oral Contraceptive (COC) Pills) Type: A Hormonal contraceptive (spacing method). Content: Each pack of Mala-N contains 21 hormonal pills and 7 Iron tablets. Composition: Each hormonal pill contains: Levonorgestrel (0.15 mg) + Ethinyl estradiol (30 \u03bcg) Each Iron tablet contains: 60 mg of ferrous fumarate. Availability: Mala-N is available free of cost at government SCs, PHCs, CHCs, sub-district and district hospitals. It is also home delivered by ASHA for 1/- per cycle of OCP. Mechanism of contraception: It inhibits ovulation by altering the FSH and LH secretion. It inhibits sperm penetration by thickening the cervical mucus. It inhibits implantation of the ovum (even if fertilized) by altering the uterine endometrium. Directions to use: Starting on the 5th day of each menstrual cycle, 1 hormonal pill per day is taken orally for 21 days consecutively, followed by 1 Iron tablet per day for the next 7 days. Bleeding occurs when the woman is on the tablets given in the last row (iron tablets). However, pills should be continued, irrespective of bleeding. It is very important to start the next pack on time. Risk of pregnancy increases, if the next pack is started late. Withdrawal bleeding: Unlike normal menstruation, an episode of uterine bleeding occurs from an incompletely formed endometrium due to the withdrawal of exogenous hormones. Hence it is called \u201cwithdrawal bleeding\u201d rather than menstruation. It is usually scanty compared to menstrual bleeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options B, C and D are false.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Effectiveness: COCs have an effectiveness of 99.97% to 99.99% If the first pack has to be started in a non-lactating woman when no bleeding occurs during a cycle: The first pack can be started at any time of such a cycle if it is reasonably certain that she is not pregnant. A backup method (e.g., Condom) is needed for the first 7 days of taking pills. If no bleeding occurs at the end of the first pack in a non-lactating woman with a regular menstrual cycle: In case of regular intake (perfect use): In case of spotting (which may not be recognizable as monthly bleeding) or no bleeding, reassure that monthly bleeding stops in some women using COCs which is not harmful. If she has been taking a pill every day regularly she should be reassured that she is not likely to be pregnant and can continue taking COCs as before. Therefore if the first strip is over the next strip should be started from the next day onwards. Failure rate: With Perfect Use: 0.3 per 100 women/year. In case of irregular intake (missing pills): If she has skipped the 7 non-hormonal pills (iron tablets in a 28-day pack), reassure her that she is not likely to be pregnant and can continue using COCs. If she has missed hormonal pills (<3 pills) or started a new pack late (<3 days), COCs can be continued. She must return for a checkup if she has signs and symptoms of early pregnancy after missing 3 or more pills or sta,rting a new pack 3 or more days later. Failure rate: With Typical Use: 8 pregnancies per 100 women/year.</p>\n<p></p>",
