      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Albumin with ostreotide Given case scenario clearly suggests hepatorenal syndrome and hence option B would be the best possible choice for management in this patient. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a form of functional severe renal failure in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis. This life-threatening complication results from marked renal vasoconstriction and its consequent reduced renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate. Type 1 HRS presents as acute renal failure characterized by at least a two-fold increase in serum creatinine to a level greater than 2.5 mg/dL in less than 2 weeks. Type 1 HRS entails a rapidly progressive decline in kidney function , while type 2 HRS is associated with ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen) that does not improve with standard diuretic medications. Diagnostic criteria of hepatorenal syndrome Major criteria* 1.    Low glomerular filtration rate, as indicated by serum cre- atinine >1.5 mg/dl. 2.    Exclusion of shock, ongoing bacterial infection, volume depletion, and use of nephrotoxic drugs. 3.    No improvement in renal function despite stopping diuretics and volume repletion with 1.5 L of saline. 4.    No proteinuria or ultrasonographic evidence of obstructive uropathy or parenchymal renal disease. Minor criteria 1.    Urine volume lower than 500 ml/day. 2.    Urine sodium lower than 10 mEq/L. 3.    Urine osmolality > plasma osmolality. 4.    Urine red blood cells <50 per high-power field. 5.    Serum sodium concentration lower than 130 mEq/L. * Only major criteria are necessary for the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. Recommended treatment for type 1 hepatorenal syndrome consists of albumin and vasoconstrictor. Studies have shown that the use of vasopressors (octreotide with midodrine, norepinephrine and terlipressin) with albumin improves renal function and mortality compared to vasopressors alone. TIPS can be used to improve refractory ascites, which is often associated with type\u20102 HRS. NOTE: Circulatory dysfunction is characterised by vasodilatation in the splanchnic circulation with a relatively low and insufficient cardiac output, leading to effective hypovolaemia. HRS may occur spontaneously with worsening liver function, or secondary to a precipitating event such as bacterial infection (eg, SBP).</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Newer classification of Hepatorenal syndrome subtypes is as follows.</p>\n<p></p>",

A \" slow y descent \" due to delayed emptying of the right atrium into the right ventricle can also be seen. A low frequency presystolic mid-diastolic murmur is heard at the lower left sternal border in the fourth intercostal space.

The Stanford system is more frequently employed. It classifies dissections into two types based on whether the ascending or descending part of the aorta is involved. Type A involves the ascending aorta, regardless of the site of the primary intimal tear. Type A dissection is defined as a dissection proximal to the brachiocephalic artery. Type B aortic dissection originating distal to the left subclavian artery and involving only descending aorta. The DeBakey classification is based upon the site of origin of the dissection. Type 1 originates in the ascending aorta and to at least the aortic arch. Type 2 originates in and is limited to the ascending aorta. Type 3 begins in the descending aorta and extends distally above the diaphragm (type 3a) or below the diaphragm (type 3b).</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The three common sites for AAD are as follows: Nearly 2-2.5 cm above the aortic root (the most common site) Just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery In the aortic arch</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Genetic Conditions Associated With Aortic Dissection Marfan syndrome A connective tissue disorder caused by a defect in a gene called FBN1.

Bicuspid aortic valve Congenital condition affecting about 1% of the general population that may occur in multiple family members. Patients with bicuspid aortic valves often have enlarged ascending aortas and are at risk for aortic dissection (5 to 10 times higher risk than the general population) Loeys-Dietz aneurysm syndrome Genetic disorder due to a mutation in TGFBR1 or TFGBR2 leading to arterial tortuosity, wide- set eyes (hypertelerism), cleft lip/palate, and aortic dissections and aneurysms involving branch vessels Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection Multiple conditions involving aneurysms and dissections that occur in several family members.

The loss of more than 80% of nephrons impairs base regeneration by the process of ammonia genesis. Although there is a compensatory increase in ammonia genesis (by more than two-fold) in remaining nephrons, the plasma concentration of bicarbonate decreases. The concentration of bicarbonate, as well as carbon dioxide, in the plasma may be decreased even in patients with moderate renal impairment. This early decrease of bicarbonate concentration is compensated by an increased concentration of chloride and does not lead to change of the anion gap. In patients with more advanced CKD, plasma bicarbonate concentration is more reduced and in these patients an increase in the anion gap is observed.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Diet history The clinical presentation is typical of lathyrism, caused by eating certain legumes of the genus Lathyrus, especially lathyrus sativas (kesari dal). Lathyrism is a form of irreversible, non-progressive spastic paraparesis associated with poorly understood degenerative changes in spinal cord. The culpable agent in lathyrus species that precipitates paralysis is considered to be the glutamate analog, beta-(N)-oxalyl-amino-L-alanine acid (BOAA). There are three types of lathyrism: neurolathyrism, osteolathyrism, and angiolathyrism, all of which are permanent but differ in symptoms and the affected tissues. Neurolathyrism is the type associated with the consumption of legumes in the genus Lathyrus that contain the toxin ODAP . ODAP ingestion results in motorneuron death. Osteolathyrism, a different type of lathyrism, affects the connective tissues, not the motorneurons. Osteolathyrism results from the ingestion of Lathyrus odoratus seeds (sweet peas) and is often referred to as odoratism. It is caused by a different toxin ( beta-aminopropionitrile ), which affects the linking of collagen , a protein of connective tissues . Another type of lathyrism is angiolathyrism, which is similar to osteolathyrism in its effects on connective tissue by means of the toxin beta-aminopropionitrile. However, the blood vessels are affected as opposed to bone. Eating the chickling pea with grain having high concentrations of sulphur-based amino acids reduces the risk of lathyrism.</p>\n<p></p>",

Heatstroke is divided further into classic and exertional forms. Classic heatstroke is caused by environmental exposure and results in core hyperthermia above 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F). This condition primarily occurs in the elderly and those with chronic illness. Classic heatstroke can develop slowly over several days and can present with minimally elevated core temperatures. It is associated with loss of sweating mechanism along with central nervous system dysfunction including delirium, convulsions, and coma, making it difficult to distinguish from sepsis. These manifestations are thought to be an encephalopathic response to a systemic inflammatory cascade. Exertional heatstroke is a condition primarily affecting younger, active persons. It is characterized by rapid onset\u2014developing in hours\u2014and frequently is associated with high core temperatures. Heat exhaustion is a more common and less extreme manifestation of heat-related illness in which the core temperature is between 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F) and 40\u00b0C. Symptoms of heat exhaustion are milder than those of heatstroke, and include dizziness, thirst, weakness, headache, and malaise. Patients with heat exhaustion lack the profound central nervous system derangement found in those with heatstroke. Their symptoms typically resolve promptly with proper hydration and cooling.

At 6 months to 2 years from onset, mixed cell reaction is seen of histiocytes, eosinophils, epithelioid cells, and lymphocytes. If still untreated, the patient may show pulmonary fibrosis.

Stool examination : To rule out other parasites causing the pulmonary eosinophilia syndrome. Quantitative serum immunoglobulin test : Elevated immunoglobulin E level is frequently seen in a patient with TPE. Indirect ELISA test : Diagnosis is confirmed by a rise in filarial antibody titers. Chest x-ray : May show reticulonodular opacities or miliary mottling in the middle or lower lung zones. About 20 to 30% of patients with TPE may have normal lungs. Fibrosis may be seen in advanced disease. Chest CT scan : May show bronchiectasis, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. It is done in cases where the diagnosis is not established.

Disulfiram prevents acetaldehyde dehydrogenase from converting acetaldehyde into acetic acid, leading to a buildup of acetaldehyde levels in the blood. These high levels of acetaldehyde levels cause unpleasant symptoms after drinking alcohol such as headache, hyoptension, severe flushing, palpitations, nausea, thirst, chest pain, and others. Many healthcare professionals may not always consider this a concern in children because alcohol consumption is not intentional, and they are unaware of the incidental exposure from concomitant use of alcohol containing medications. Alcohol is commonly used in oral liquid medications as a solvent and preservative, although it may not always be clear which medications contain this excipient or what percentage of alcohol they contain.</p>\n<p></p>",

Non ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS, here defined as unstable angina and non ST-elevation MI) is characterised by:- episodes of chest pain at rest or with minimal exertion , which increase in frequency or severity , with dynamic ECG changes.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>High-sensitivity troponin (hs-Tn) assay measurements are recommended . In general, novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are preferred over vitamin K antagonists Dual antithrombotic therapy with a NOAC at the recommended dose for stroke prevention and Single antiplatelet therapy (preferably clopidogrel , chosen in >90% of cases in available trials) is recommended as the default strategy up to 12 months after a short period up to 1 week of triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT) (with NOAC and DAPT).

In general, individuals with unstable angina have a substantially lower risk of death Intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa platelet receptor inhibitors may reduce the combined end point of death and MI in NSTE-ACS, but increase the risk of bleeding. Unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin plus aspirin may reduce death or MI at 1 week, but longer-term benefits are unclear. Low molecular weight heparin may reduce MI compared with unfractionated heparin. Fondaparinux (a factor Xa inhibitor) seems to be as effective as low molecular weight heparin at reducing death or MI, and cause less major bleeding. Compared with unfractionated heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors (hirudin and bivalirudin) may result in similar frequency of mortality or MI and may reduce the risk of bleeding Warfarin has not been shown to be beneficial and increases the risk of major bleeding.
