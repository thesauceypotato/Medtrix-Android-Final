Thereafter it separates progressively from the glans and is non-adherent by 6 years of age. Phimosis is a condition in which the prepuce is so tight that it cannot be retracted fully from the glans.

In this case, the glans are often grooved on its ventral aspect. Penile: When the urethra opens anywhere between the base of the glans and in front of the scrotum. Penoscrotal: When the urethra opens at the junction of the penis and scrotum. Perineal: When a wide sagittal slit is found along the entire length of the penis and scrotum.

Hypospadias Hypospadias: It is the commonest congenital anomaly of the urethra (occurring in 3\u20135/100 births). In this condition, the external urethral orifice (EUO) is located on the ventral aspect of the penis, instead of at the tip of the penis. It occurs due to failure of canalization of the ectodermal cord in the glans and/or failure of fusion of the urethral folds. Usually, the penis is underdeveloped and curved ventrally, producing a clinical condition called chordae . Option B. Sterility Male infertility can be caused by low sperm production, abnormal sperm function, or blockages that prevent the delivery of sperm. Illnesses, injuries, chronic health problems, lifestyle choices, and other factors may contribute to male infertility. Option D. Ectopic testis An ectopic testis is one that is located in an aberrant position off the path of normal descent. The most common site of palpable ectopia is the superficial inguinal pouch of Denis-Browne, located between Scarpa's fascia and the external oblique fascia above the external inguinal ring.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Epispadias : In this condition, the urethral orifice is located on the dorsal aspect of the penis. It is a rare anomaly and occurs in 1/30,000 births. Although epispadias may occur as an isolated defect, it is mostly associated with exstrophy of the urinary bladder (ectopia vesicae). The exact embryological basis for this condition is not clear. Probably it occurs when the genital tubercle instead of being formed cranial to the cloacal membrane is formed more dorsally in the region of anorectal septum, and thus part of the urogenital membrane is seen cranial to the genital tubercle. When this membrane ruptures then the uro- genital sinus opens on the dorsal aspect of the penis and then the urethral groove extends on the dorsal aspect of the penis.</p>\n<p></p>",
