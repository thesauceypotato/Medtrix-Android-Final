More familiar Pneumocystis carinii is found only in Rats.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option:A. Patients with HIV infection who have a CD4+ count < 100/mm3 and test positive for Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies should receive primary prophylaxis against this pathogen with TMP-SMX. Since this patient has a CD4+ count of 162/mm3, he does not require prophylaxis against T. gondii. Option:C. Patients with HIV infection should receive regular screening for latent tuberculosis, and patients with a positive screening test who are receiving antiretroviral therapy should receive isoniazid monotherapy. However, this patient has a negative interferon-\u03b3 release assay and, therefore, does not require prophylaxis. Option:D. Patients with a CD4+ count < 100/mm3 have an increased risk of developing invasive aspergillosis. This patient has a CD4+ count of 162/mm3. In addition, prophylaxis against Aspergillus fumigatus is not generally recommended for patients with HIV infection, regardless of their CD4+ count, because of the risk of drug interactions, adverse effects, and drug resistance. Prophylaxis against A. fumigatus does not have a proven survival benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Patients with HIV infection who have a CD4+ count < 200/mm3 should receive primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii with TMP-SMX. Patients who have contraindications to taking this drug (e.g., due to sulfa allergy) should receive atovaquone, dapsone, or aerosolized pentamidine instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Pneumocystis\njiroveci Pneumonia Protozoa?\n     Fungus?
