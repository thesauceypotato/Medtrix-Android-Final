Ethylene glycol is converted into glycolaldehyde (causes neurotoxicity) in the presence of  enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase which is inhibited by the drug named Excess of valproate leads to carnitine deficiency which results in increase in ammonia; levocarnitine assists in restoring carnitine stores , hence prevents valproate toxicity .
