      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Body packing Body packing - A method of transporting or trafficking high quality narcotic drugs (heroin, cocaine). It is known as body- packing as the carrier swallows the drug cylinders and retrieve them after reaching the destination. CT is the best investigation to diagnose body packing. The given case scenario is indicating illegal drug smuggling known as Body packing. Illegal drugs, such as Cocaine, heroin, amphetamine and cannabis are compressed into cylinders of about 25 x 12 mm in size, heat-sealed in plastic film and wrapped again in multiple layers of latex (condoms, balloons, foil, fingers of rubber gloves, etc.) and swallowed. One packet may contain 3 to 7 g of the narcotic. Drugs such as loperamide or diphenoxylate hydrochloride with atropine may be taken to reduce gut motility and prevent the passage of the packages on a long-distance flight, before the end of the It is done for the purpose of smuggling, known as \u201cBody packing\u201d. They can conceal half a of the drug. On arrival at his destination, the courier takes a laxative, retrieves the packets and passes them on to the \u201cpusher\u201d who distributes the drug. The packets may cause bowel obstruction secondary to torsion, intussusception or impaction. Many times the packets become unsealed or burst in the small intestine, especially cocaine-filled containers, allowing massive absorption and causing the courier's death from poisoning. Even if the packets do not rupture, drugs may passively diffuse from the stomach into surrounding organs, including the lower lobe of the left lung, left lobe of the liver and heart and appear in the circulation and urine. People who swallow these are known as \u2018Mules\u2019.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1,2,5 Volatile substance abuse (solvent abuse, glue sniffing) involves the deliberate inhaling of a variety of substances, such as toluene, gasoline(petrol), xylene, benzene, chloroform, methylene and ethylene chloride, fluorocarbons, carbon tetrachloride, butane, propane, kerosine, isopropane, amyl nitrite, acetone, trichloroethylene, etc. for their psychotropic and hallucinatory properties. Volatiles such as paint stripper typewriting erasure fluid, brush cleaner, household aerosols, fabric cleaner, gasoline and glue solvent are misused. Huffing refers to inhaling vapours from a cloth that is saturated with the volatile substance and held over or near the nose and mouth. Bagging refers to inhaling and exhaling into a bag that has been filled with a small amount of a volatile substance. Clinical manifestations depend on the substance abused, Gaseous substance may be introduced directly into the mouth or nose from either a large cylinder or from the small ampoule cylinders. Others are used directly from pressurised aerosol cans, including pain-relieving Sniffing is done with jerry cans and petro- fillers. The sufferer often behaves totally irrationally, commits antisocial acts and may injure or even kill himself. Later the abuser will often have complete amnesia for the period of intoxication. Most of the abusers are young, usually male teenagers, and no physical withdrawal is Douching is a substance used as a nasal spray. Mainlining refers to the intravenous administration of drugs mainly narcotics. People who do this are called \u201cMainliners\u201d. When frequently done with some needles, the results of needle tract ulcers are called Mainlining Scars. Skin popping is the subcutaneous injection of narcotics. Scars due to frequent subcutaneous injections of narcotics are known as Map shaped ulcers. So, skin popping is not used for aerosols. A correct explanation for Huffing, Bagging and mainlining is given.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Sniffing is the direct inhalation of a substance from the mouth of the container, Douching is the usage of the substance as a nasal spray and skin popping is the subcutaneous injection of narcotics. Scars due to frequent subcutaneous injections of narcotics known as Map shaped ulcers are wrongly matched. Option: B. Sniffing is the direct inhalation of substance from the mouth of the container and the skin popping explanation is wrongly matched. Option: C.

MDMA(Methylenedioxymethamphetamine) also known as Molly / Ecstasy is similar to mescaline and is also known as one of the \u2018club drugs\u2019 or \u2018rave drugs\u2019 Because MDMA is used for euphoric stimulation in clubs or parties. The most commonly used hallucinogenic drugs are LSD and MDMA. It is supposed to interact with serotonergic neurons in the CNS. Acute symptoms include euphoria, heightened sensual awareness, and increased psychic and emotional energy. MDMA produces less amount of emotional liability, depersonalization and disturbance of thought. Adverse effects include nausea, teeth grinding, blurred vision, anxiety, panic attacks and psychosis. MDMA has been associated with sudden death due to cardiac arrhythmia. No specific treatment for acute overdose, only symptomatic treatment is given.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide) is obtained from rye fungus and is rapidly absorbed from GIT with an onset of action in 30-40 minutes. It affects levels of 5-HT levels in the brain. A common pattern of LSD use is Trip. Anxiolytics along with symptomatic treatment are Acute intoxication produces altered changes in vision and hearing, like floating feelings, illusions, and sensations of synesthesia, i.e., \u2018seeing\u2019 smells and \u2018hearing colours. Option: C. Cocaine use produces a mild physical, but strong psychic dependence. A triphasic withdrawal syndrome follows an abrupt discontinuation of chronic cocaine use. In the crash phase (9 hrs to 4 days) there is anorexia, depression, agitation, excessive craving, hypersomnia, fatigue and exhaustion which is followed by normal mood, anxiety and anhedonia (next 4-7 days). In the third phase (extinction phase), there are no withdrawal symptoms but increased vulnerability to relapse. Bromocriptine and amantadine are useful in reducing cocaine cravings. Gabapentin is being used in adult addicts. Option: D. Nicotine is the active ingredient in cigarettes which causes intoxication, dependence, tolerance and withdrawal syndrome. Each cigarette contains 10mg of nicotine and the cigarette delivers 1-3mg of nicotine. Nicotine affects cholinergic receptors at the nucleus accumbens. It also increases acetylcholine, serotonin and beta-endorphin</p>\n<p></p>",

Harm Both-individual and society Individual only Harmful use is continued drug use despite awareness of harmful medical and/or social effects of the drug being used / or a pattern of physically hazardous use of the drug (e.g-driving in intoxication). The diagnosis requires that actual damage should have been caused to the mental or physical health of the abuser. Harmful use is not diagnosed if dependence syndrome is present. Acute intoxication is a transient condition, resulting in disturbance of the level of consciousness, cognition, perception, behaviour or other psycho-physiological functions and responses. This is usually associated with high blood levels of the psychoactive substance. The intensity of intoxication lessens with time, and effects gradually disappear in the absence of further use of the substance. Recovery is complete, except where tissue damage or some complication has risen.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option B. Drug Habituation - In it, there is desire but no compulsion, no tendency to increase the dose of the drug. Some degree of psychological but not physical dependence.
