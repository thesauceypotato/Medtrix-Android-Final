While the antifungal activity of amphotericin B is retained following its incorporation into a liposome bilayer, its toxicity is significantly reduced. Option D. Caspofungin has been effective in treating fungal infections caused by Aspergillus and Candida It is a member of the echinocandin family, a new class of antifungal agents with broad spectrum of activity against all Candida species. In comparison to treatment with either fluconazole or Amphotericin B, all three drugs in this class have been demonstrated to be highly effective or superior in well-defined clinical settings including invasive Candida infections</p>\n<p></p>",

Hyperuricemia is one of the side effect of hydrochlorothiazide. Thiazide causes hyperuricemia by the following mechanisms - Hydrochlorothiazide acts by inhibiting NaCl and water absorption in DCT because of which osmotic pressure decreases in the body and because uric acid is osmotic in nature which leads to compensatory reabsorption of uric acid in the body. Uric acid is absorbed in PCT via a pump URAT1/OAT1 and thiazides also acts via same transporter. Therefore, Thiazides competitively block the excretion of uric acid and causes   hyperuricemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B.
