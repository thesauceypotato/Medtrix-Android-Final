      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Early adenoidectomy helps in developing immunity to pneumococcus. The function of the lymphoid tissue of Waldeyer\u2019s ring is to produce antibodies. The adenoid produces B-cells , giving rise to IgG and IgA plasma cells. Evidence supports the concern that early adenoidectomy produces a detectable negative effect on the development of serum IgG antibodies, resulting in impaired immunity to pneumococcus.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Enlarged adenoids (arrows) in a 7-year-old girl. There is very little breathing space in the nasopharynx. Adenoid tissue is seen on MRI in all infants by age of 5 months, gradually it increases in size and is at its maximum on 6-7 years. Starts regressing at puberty and disappears by the age of 15 years. Persistence of tissue may be seen beyond 15 years in cases of allergy or infection. Symptoms of adenoid disease depend on the comparative size of nasopharynx.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. The adenoid is visible using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from the age of 4 months in 18% of children. At 5 months of age, the adenoid could be identified in all children. Option: C. Topical nasal steroid sprays can cause a reduction in adenoid size with improvements in the presence of nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, cough, snoring, and sleep apnoea. Option: D. Adenoid hypertrophy is highly suspicious of immunodeficiency in adult patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Adenoids cause tubal dysfunction by: (a) Mechanical obstruction of the tubal opening. (b) Acting as a reservoir for pathogenic organisms. (c) In cases of allergy, mast cells of the adenoid tissue release inflammatory mediators which cause tubal blockage. Thus, adenoids can cause otitis media with effusion or recurrent acute otitis media. Adenoidectomy can help both of these conditions.</p>\n<p></p>",
