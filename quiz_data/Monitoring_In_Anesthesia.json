Option C - Too large cuff will underestimate while too small cuff will overestimate the actual value. Loose cuffs also overestimate the actual value. Option D- Patients with arteriosclerosis have less compressible arteries therefore will overestimate the actual blood pressure.

After exsanguination of the hand, pressure is applied on the radial and ulnar artery till the hand is blanched from pressure. Now release the ulnar artery while still maintaining pressure on the radial artery. If the ulnar artery is patent, the normal color of the hand should return within 6-10 seconds.

If the color of the hand remains the same that means Ulnar circulation is patent. If there is discoloration that means ulnar circulation is compromised. This is called a positive Allen\u2019s test.

Movement response to painful stimuli, and eye movements but may not be seen in patients who have been given muscle relaxants. Tachypnea, laryngospasm, bronchospasm or breath holding. EEG and evoked responses were also utilized to assess depth of anesthesia but were very difficult to monitor and not too reliable either. BispectRal index SCORE (BIS) is the first scientifically validated and commercially available monitor to check the depth of anesthesia. It utilizes many parameters like multiple EEG signals to calculate a score. A score of 45-60 is considered adequate depth (a score of 100 is for a fully awake state and 0 for a completely silent brain).

Swan Ganz catheter is used for pulmonary artery catheterization. It can be utilized to: Measure all cardiac chambers pressure except the left ventricle. Calculating cardiac output- Cardiac output is calculated by using ice-cold saline (Thermodilution method). Measuring pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) {formerly called as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) Taking a sample for mixed venous blood (the pulmonary artery is considered the best site for a mixed venous blood sample) Titration of fluid infusion: PAOP is a better guide than CVP for fluid titration as it also measures preload to the left heart while CVP only measures preload to the right heart.</p>\n<p></p>",
