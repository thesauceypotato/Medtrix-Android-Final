B) Phagocytosis is enhanced</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Phagocytosis is enhanced: This statement is incorrect. NET formation does not directly enhance phagocytosis. Instead, it is a distinct mechanism where the neutrophil traps and kills pathogens extracellularly, without engulfing them through phagocytosis.</li><li>\u2022 Phagocytosis is enhanced:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a defense mechanism employed by neutrophils to trap and kill extracellular pathogens. During NET formation, neutrophils undergo a process called NETosis, which involves chromatin decondensation and the release of DNA along with antibacterial enzymes into the extracellular space. This forms a mesh-like structure that can trap and kill bacteria.</li><li>\u2022 Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Induced by sepsis: True. NETs are induced by various stimuli, including sepsis. In septicemia-like conditions, the presence of pathogens triggers the formation of NETs as a response to the infection.</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Induced by sepsis:</li><li>\u2022 Option C: Higher risk of SLE: True. NET formation also has some negative consequences. The exposure of nuclear antigens during NETosis can lead to an increased risk of developing autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The nuclear antigens released during NET formation can be recognized as \"self\" by the immune system, leading to the production of autoantibodies and the development of SLE.</li><li>\u2022 Option C: Higher risk of SLE:</li><li>\u2022 Option D: Affected cell does not survive: True. In NET formation, the neutrophil undergoes a form of cell death called NETotic cell death. The affected neutrophil does not survive the process of NETosis, as it involves the release of its cellular contents, including DNA and enzymes. This process is sometimes referred to as \"beneficial suicide\" because the neutrophil sacrifices itself to create the extracellular trap that can capture and kill pathogens.</li><li>\u2022 Option D: Affected cell does not survive:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Neutrophil extracellular traps are induced by sepsis, increase the risk of developing SLE due to exposure of nuclear antigens, and result in the death of the affected neutrophil, but they do not enhance phagocytosis.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

These specialized astrocytes are characterized by enlarged, pale nuclei with prominent nucleoli and margination of chromatin. They develop in response to metabolic insults, particularly hyperammonemia. Alzheimer's disease instead shows neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, and neuritic plaques as its characteristic pathological findings, along with diffuse cerebral atrophy affecting the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Hepatic encephalopathy - This condition is characterized by the presence of Alzheimer type II astrocytes. These astrocytic changes occur in response to elevated ammonia levels that cannot be properly metabolized due to liver dysfunction, resulting in cerebral toxicity.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Hepatic encephalopathy</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Wilson's Disease - This inherited disorder of copper metabolism affects both the liver and brain. The liver damage leads to increased ammonia levels, which can cause formation of Alzheimer type II astrocytes in the brain as a secondary phenomenon.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Wilson's Disease</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Urea Cycle Disorders - These genetic disorders impair the body's ability to eliminate ammonia, leading to hyperammonemia.
