      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>18-FDG PET The ideal imaging modality for detecting hibernating myocardium is C) 18-FDG PET. This technique, using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), is crucial for assessing myocardial viability by differentiating potentially functional tissue from non-functional tissue.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Radionuclide angiography is an area of nuclear medicine which specialises in imaging to show the functionality of the right and left ventricles of the heart, thus allowing informed diagnostic intervention in heart failure. It involves use of a radiopharmaceutical, injected into a patient, and a gamma camera for acquisition. A MUGA scan (multigated acquisition) involves an acquisition triggered (gated) at different points of the cardiac cycle. MUGA scanning is also called equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography (RNVG), or gated blood pool imaging, as well as SYMA scanning (synchronized multigated acquisition scanning)</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - MUGA Scan tells about ventricular function in terms of ejection function Pyrophosphate Scan tells about infarct tissue So ,both above options are ruled out Thallium Scan also tells about blood supply hence indicates ischemia (widely used but not accurate as the redistribution is slow or incomplete) Normally heart uses fatty acids for energy. But in ischemia energy source is glucose \u2026so 18-FDG PET becomes investigation of choice here for hibernating myocardium</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Using sound waves, an echo allows the care team to see exactly how the patient's heart pumps blood. Using nuclear imaging via a radiotracer , a MUGA scan provides the care team with a precise reading of the patient's ejection fraction (EF), which measures how much blood is pumped out of the heart.</p>\n<p></p>",
