ROTAVIRUS: Rotaviruses resemble cartwheels with short spokes radiating from a wide hub to a clearly defined outer rim. The name is derived from rota, which in Latin, means- ing wheel. The complete or 'double-shelled' virus measures about 70 nm in diameter and has a smooth surface. Identified by Bishop and colleagues (1973) in Melbourne, rotaviruses are now recognised as the most common cause of diarrheal disease in infants and children. Divided into six groups (A-F) and 14 serotypes (9 humans, 5 animals) (option A) The commonest cause of gastroenteritis in children below 2 years of age(option B) Infection is transmitted by contaminated water and food(option D) I.P.: 1-2 days, vomiting, diarrhoea, dehydration</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Laboratory diagnosis Antigen detection: latex agglutination, passive haemagglutination, ELISA enzyme-linked immunoassay.

The virions measure 60\u201380 nm in diameter and possess two concentric capsid shells, each of which is icosahedral. (Rotaviruses have a triple-layered structure.) There is no envelope. Single-shelled virus particles that lack the outer capsid are 50\u201360 nm in diameter. The inner core of the particles is 33\u201340 nm in diameter. The double-shelled particle is the complete infectious form of the virus. Option: C. Picornaviruses represent a very large virus family concerning the number of members but one of the smallest in terms of virion size and genetic complexity. They include two major groups of human pathogens: enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. The virion of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses consists of a capsid shell of 60 subunits, each of four proteins (VP1\u2013VP4) arranged with icosahedral symmetry around a genome made up of a single strand of positive-sense RNA. Parechoviruses are similar except that their capsids contain only three proteins because VP0 does not get cleaved into VP2 and VP4.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Hepatitis B is transmitted when blood, semen, or another body fluid from a person infected with HBV enters the body of someone who is not infected.
