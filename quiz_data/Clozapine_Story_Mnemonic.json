      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Clozapine This patient has refractory schizophrenia . He now has agranulocytosis which likely led to an infection. Clozapine is used primarily for resistant schizophrenia (to first-line pharmacological therapy). While it is highly effective in the treatment of schizophrenia, it has serious adverse effects , which can include the life-threatening agranulocytosis seen in this patient. About 1\u20132% of all patients who begin taking clozapine eventually develop agranulocytosis (usually in the first months of treatment ), though this risk falls substantially after the first year. The most common symptoms of agranulocytosis are oral ulcerations, fever, malaise , and increased susceptibility to infections such as pneumonia.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic that can cause sedation , metabolic syndrome, hyperglycemia , and weight gain. This patient's agranulocytosis is not a typical adverse effect. Option: C. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is commonly used as a first-line treatment for schizophrenia. Adverse effects include weight gain , hyperglycemia, and orthostatic hypotension , but it does not typically cause agranulocytosis. Furthermore, it is rarely used for refractory schizophrenia, making it an unlikely cause of this patient's symptoms. Option: D. Haloperidol is a high-potency antipsychotic that can cause extrapyramidal and anticholinergic adverse effects , neither of which are seen in this patient. This patient's agranulocytosis is not an expected adverse effect.</p>\n<p></p>",
