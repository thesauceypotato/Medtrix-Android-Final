Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone or ADH) is often used as an adjunctive therapy to catecholamine vasopressors in the treatment of distributive o r vasodilatory shock . It causes peripheral vasoconstriction via V1 receptors located in smooth muscle cells and attenuation of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and GMP, the second messenger of NO. The rationale for using low dose vasopressin in the management of septic shock includes the relative deficiency of vasopressin in late shock. It also potentiates the effects of catecholamines in the vasculature and stimulates cortisol production. Some studies have reported reduced catecholamine requirements with vasopressin administration. Intravenous infusion of vasopressin at a low dose (0.01\u20130.04 units/min) may be safe and beneficial in septic patients with hypertension that is refractory to fluid resuscitation and conventional catecholamine vasopressors. Higher doses of vasopressin decrease cardiac output and may put patients at greater risk for splanchnic and coronary artery ischemia. Studies do not favor the use of vasopressin as first-line therapy. In the Vasopressin and Septic Shock Trial (VASST), low doses of vasopressin did not reduce mortality compared with norepinephrine in patients with septic shock who were being treated with catecholamine vasopressors.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Natural resistance: Some microbes have always been resistant to certain AMAs. They lack the metabolic process or the target site which is affected by the particular drug. This is generally a group or species characteristic, e.g. gram-negative bacilli are normally unaffected by penicillin G; aerobic organisms are not affected by metronidazole; while anaerobic bacteria are not inhibited by aminoglycoside antibiotics or M. tuberculosis is insensitive to tetracyclines.

This action is unrelated to its vitamin activity and not present in nicotinamide. When nicotinic acid is given, TGs and VLDL decrease rapidly, followed by a modest fall in LDL-CH and total CH. A 20\u201350% reduction in plasma TGs and 15\u201325% reduction in CH levels has been recorded.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Nicotinic acid is the most effective drug to raise HDL-CH, prob- ably by decreasing rate of HDL destruction; a 20\u201335% increase   is generally obtained. Adverse effects: The large doses needed for hypolipidemic action are poorly tolerated. Only about half of the patients are able to take the full doses. It is a cutaneous vasodilator: marked flushing, heat and itching (especially in the blush area) occur after every dose. This is associated with release of PGD2 in the skin, and can be minimized by starting with a low dose taken with meals and gradually increasing as tolerance develops. Use of sustained release (SR/ER) tablet also subdues flushing. Aspirin taken before niacin substantially attenuates flushing by inhibiting PG synthesis. Laropiprant is a specific ant flushing drug with no hypolipidemic action of its own, that has been combined with nicotinic acid to minimize flushing. Dyspepsia is very common; vomiting and diarrhea occur when full doses are given. Peptic ulcer may be activated. Dryness and hyperpigmentation of skin can be troublesome. Other long-term effects are\u2014liver dysfunction and jaundice. Serious liver damage is the most important risk. Hyperglycemia, precipitation of diabetes (should not be used in diabetics). Hyperuricemia and gout, atrial arrhythmias. It is contraindicated during pregnancy and in children. Postural hypotension may occur in patients on antihypertensives when they take nicotinic acid.

Injected IV, it is indicated only in patients who are at risk of heparin induced thrombocytopenia. On repeated/prolonged administration, antibodies against the lepirudin-thrombin complex may develop resulting in prolonged anticoagulant effect and possibility of anaphylaxis. Its action cannot be reversed by protamine or any other antidote. \u25aa Bivalirudin: It is a smaller peptide prepared synthetically which has actions and uses similar to lepirudin. However, its action is slowly reversible due to cleavage of its peptide bonds by thrombin itself. \u25aa Argatroban: This is a synthetic non peptide compound which binds reversibly to the catalytic site of thrombin, but not to the substrate recognition site. As such, it produces    a rapid and short-lasting antithrombin action. Administered by IV infusion, it can be used in place of lepirudin for short- term indications in patients with heparin induced thrombo- cytopenia. B. Fondaparinux: The Penta saccharide with specific sequence that binds to AT III with high affinity to selectively inactivate factor Xa without binding thrombin (factor IIa), has been recently produced synthetically and given the name fondaparinux. It is being increasingly used and has been marketed in India as well. The bioavailability of fondaparinux injected SC is 100% and it is longer acting (t\u00bd 17 hours). Metabolism is minimal, and it is largely excreted unchanged by the kidney. As such, it is not to be used in renal failure patients. It is less likely to cause thrombocytopenia compared to even LMW heparins. Risk of osteoporosis after prolonged use is also minimal. It does not require laboratory monitoring of aPTT, and is a longer acting alternative to LMW heparins with the above advantages. Dose: 5\u201310 mg SC once daily. C. Dabigatran etexilate: It is a prodrug which after oral administration is rapidly hydrolysed to dabigatran , a direct thrombin inhibitor which reversibly blocks the catalytic site of thrombin and produces a rapid (within 2 hours) anticoagulant action. Though oral bioavailability is low, the anticoagulant effect is consistent, and no laboratory monitoring is required. The plasma t\u00bd is 12\u201314 hours and duration of action 24 hours. In the UK, Canada and Europe it is approved for prevention of venous thromboembolism following hip/knee joint replacement surgery. Administered in a dose of 110 mg (75 mg for elderly > 75 years) once daily, it has been found comparable to warfarin. In another large trial dabigatran etexilate 150 mg twice daily has yielded superior results to warfarin for prevention of embolism and stroke in patients of atrial fibrillation. In the USA it is approved for this indication. Adverse effects are bleeding and less commonly hepatobiliary disorders.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

The pure alkaloid was isolated in 1820. It is neither analgesic nor antiinflammatory, but it specifically sup- presses gouty inflammation. It does not inhibit the synthesis or promote the excretion of uric acid. Thus, it has no effect on blood uric acid levels. An acute attack of gout is started by the precipitation of urate crystals in the synovial fluid. On being engulfed by the synovial cells, they release mediators and start an inflammatory response. Chemotactic factors are produced \uf0ae granulocyte migration into the joint; they phagocytose urate crystals and release a glycoprotein which aggravates the inflammation by: Increasing lactic acid production from inflammatory cells \u2192 local pH is reduced \u2192 more urate crystals are precipitated in the affected joint. Releasing lysosomal enzymes which cause joint destruction. Colchicine does not affect phagocytosis of urate crystals, but inhibits release of chemotactic factors and of the glycoprotein, thus suppressing the subsequent events. By binding to fibrillar protein tubulin, it inhibits granulocyte migration into the inflamed joint and thus interrupts the vicious cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Other actions of colchicine are: \u25aa Antimitotic: Causes metaphase arrest by binding to micro- tubules of mitotic spindle. It was tried for cancer chemo- therapy but abandoned due to toxicity. It is used to produce polyploidy in plants. \u25aa  Increases gut motility through neural mechanisms. Pharmacokinetics: It is rapidly absorbed orally, partly metabolized in liver and excreted in bile, undergoes enterohepatic circulation ultimate disposal occurs in urine and feces over many days. Binding of colchicine to intracellular tubulin con- tributes to its large volume of distribution and slow elimination. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 retard colchicine metabolism and enhance its toxicity. Toxicity is high and dose related. Nausea, vomiting, watery or bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps occur as dose limiting adverse effects. Accumulation of the drug in intestine and inhibition of mitosis in its rapid turnover mucosa is responsible for the toxicity. In overdose, colchicine\u2019s produces kidney damage, CNS depression, intestinal bleeding; death is due to muscular paralysis and respiratory failure. Chronic therapy with colchicine is not recommended because it causes aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, myopathy and loss of hair. \u2022  Uses: \u25aa Treatment of acute gout: Colchicine is the fastest acting drug to control an acute attack of gout; 0.5 mg 1\u20133 hourly with a total of 3 doses in a day; maximum 6.0 mg in a course spread over 3\u20134 days. Control of attack is usually achieved in 4\u201312 hours. A second course should not be started before 3\u20137 days. The response is dramatic, so much so that it may be considered diagnostic. However, because of higher toxicity, it is used only when NSAIDs are ineffective or cannot be used. Maintenance doses (0.5\u20131 mg/day) may be given for 4\u20138 weeks in which time control of hyperuricemia is achieved with other drugs. \u25aa Prophylaxis: Colchicine 0.5\u20131 mg/day can prevent further attacks of acute gout, but NSAIDs are generally preferred. Taken at the first symptom of an attack, small doses (0.5\u20131.5 mg) of colchicine abort it.</p>\n<p></p>",

Prasugrel is about 10-fold more potent than clopidogrel and has a more rapid onset of action because of better absorption and more streamlined metabolic activation. Prasugrel was compared with clopidogrel in 13,608 patients with acute coronary syndromes who were scheduled to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention. The incidence of the primary efficacy endpoint, a composite of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke, was significantly lower with prasugrel than with clopidogrel (9.9% and 12.1%, respectively), mainly reflecting a reduction in the incidence of nonfatal MI. The incidence of stent thrombosis also was significantly lower with prasugrel (1.1% and 2.4%, respectively). However, these advantages were at the expense of significantly higher rates of fatal bleeding (0.4% and 0.1%, respectively) and life-threatening bleeding (1.4% and 0.9%, respectively) with prasugrel. Because patients older than age 75 years and those with a history of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack have a particularly high-risk of bleeding, prasugrel should generally be avoided in older patients, and the drug is contraindicated in those with a history of cerebrovascular disease. Caution is required if prasugrel is used in patients weighing less than 60 kg or in those with renal impairment. Because of the negative results of this study, prasugrel is reserved for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. In this setting, prasugrel is usually given in conjunction with aspirin.

Cramps and excessive purging occur in some individuals. The active principle of these drugs acts on the myenteric plexus to increase peristalsis and decrease segmentation. They also promote secretion and inhibit salt and water absorption in the colon. Senna anthraquinone has been found to stimulate PGE2 pro- duction in rat intestine.

The signs and symptoms either are localized to the urinary tract or can include otherwise unexplained systemic manifestations, such as fever. The accepted threshold for bacteriuria to meet the definition of CAUTI is \u2265103 CFU/mL, while the threshold for bacteriuria to meet the definition of ASB is \u2265105 CFU/mL The formation of biofilm (a living layer of uropathogen) on the urinary catheter is central to the pathogenesis of CAUTI and affects both therapeutic and preventive strategies. Organisms in a biofilm are relatively resistant to killing by antibiotics, and eradication of a catheter-associated biofilm is difficult without removal of the device itself. Furthermore, because catheters provide a conduit for bacteria to enter the bladder, bacteriuria is inevitable with long-term catheter use. The typical signs and symptoms of UTI, including pain, urgency, dysuria, fever, peripheral leukocytosis, and pyuria, have less predictive value for the diagnosis of infection in catheterized patients. Furthermore, the presence of bacteria in the urine of a patient who is febrile and catheterized does not necessarily predict CAUTI, and other explanations for the fever should be considered. The etiology of CAUTI is diverse, and urine culture results are essential to guide treatment. Fairly good evidence supports the practice of catheter change during treatment for CAUTI. The goal is to remove biofilm-associated organisms that could serve as a nidus for reinfection. Pathology studies reveal that many patients with long-term catheters have occult pyelonephritis. In general, a 7- to 14-day course of antibiotics is recommended, but further studies on the optimal duration of therapy are needed. In the setting of long-term catheter use, systemic antibiotics, bladder-acidifying agents, antimicrobial bladder washes, topical disinfectants, and antimicrobial drainage-bag solutions have all been ineffective at preventing the onset of bacteriuria and have been associated with the emergence of resistant organisms. The best strategy for prevention of CAUTI is to avoid insertion of unnecessary catheters and to remove catheters once they are no longer necessary. However, intermittent catheterization may be preferable to long-term indwelling urethral catheterization in certain populations (e.g. spinal cord\u2013injured persons) to prevent both infectious and anatomic complications. Antimicrobial catheters impregnated with silver or nitrofurazone have not been shown to provide significant clinical benefit in terms of reducing rates of symptomatic UTI. Cystitis is a risk factor for recurrent cystitis and pyelonephritis. ASB is common among elderly and catheterized patients but does not in itself increase the risk of death. The relation- ships among recurrent UTI, chronic pyelonephritis, and renal insufficiency have been widely studied. In spinal cord\u2013injured patients, use of a long-term indwelling bladder catheter is a well-documented risk factor for bladder cancer. Chronic bacteriuria resulting in chronic inflammation is one possible explanation for this observation. Most common pathogens involved were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae which produce the enzymes Extended Spectrum \u03b2 -Lactamases (ESBLs).</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Beta lactamase inhibitors A drug given in conjunction with a beta-lactam antibiotics.
