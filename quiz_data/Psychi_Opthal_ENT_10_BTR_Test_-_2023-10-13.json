When she must run errands, she insists that her husband accompany her. She stopped working 2 years ago due to severe episodes of anxiety that would occur unpredictably for no apparent reason. Since that time, the patient has continued to experience these episodes several times a week and has become more socially isolated due to fears of having another episode. She avoids seeing her friends except for the rare occasions when they come to her home. The patient feels badly that she is no longer working and contributing to the household finances. She has occasional difficulty falling asleep and problems with concentration. Although she is not looking for work, she keeps her home clean, cooks nightly, and enjoys watching television.
