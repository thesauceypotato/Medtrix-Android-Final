In the Romberg test, the patient is asked to stand with feet together and arms by the side with eyes first open and then closed. With the eyes open, the patient can still compensate for the imbalance, but the vestibular system is more disadvantaged with the eyes closed. In peripheral vestibular lesions, the patient sways to the side of the In central vestibular disorder, the patient shows instability. Option C. Fistula test - This test aims to induce nystagmus by producing pressure changes in the external canal which are then transmitted to the labyrinth\u2014stimulation of the labyrinth results in nystagmus and vertigo.
