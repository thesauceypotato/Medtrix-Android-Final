      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Obturator nerve injury The obturator nerve (L2-L4) is most commonly injured during retroperitoneal surgery for gynecologic malignancies. In this case, a pelvic lymph node dissection for endometrial cancer involves a retroperitoneal dissection into the obturator fossa to remove the obturator lymph nodes. The nodal tissue of the obturator fossa obscures the location of the obturator nerve and predisposes it to injury. Postoperatively, patients with an injury to the obturator nerve will present with sensory loss to the upper medial thigh and motor weakness in the hip adductors. The obturator nerve is the nerve of the medial compartment of the thigh ; If an obturator nerve injury is recognised intraoperatively, immediate repair is the recommended treatment. However, with postoperative recognition, as in this case, treatment includes physiotherapy with neuromuscular electrical stimulation, electromyographic biofeedback, and exercise. Obturator nerve injury is a highly treatable condition, and complete recovery of motor strength is generally the result after physical therapy. Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A . The femoral nerve is the most commonly injured nerve at the time of gynecologic surgical procedures. It is usually damaged during laparotomy from inappropriate placement of lateral retractor blades. Patients with injury to the femoral nerve will present with diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes and an inability to straight leg raise, flex at the hips, or extend the knee. There may also be a loss of cutaneous sensation over the anterior thigh and the medial aspect of the thigh and calf. Option B. The genitofemoral nerve (L1, L2) runs along the ventral surface of the psoas muscle, lateral to the external iliac artery. If removed or damaged, patients present with numbness of the ipsilateral mons pubis, labia majora, and skin overlying the femoral triangle . This nerve conducts sensory information only, thus no loss in motor function. Option C. The pudendal nerve (S2-S4) also conducts sensory information\u2014injury to the pudendal nerve results in a loss of sensation to the perineum.</p>\n<p></p>",
