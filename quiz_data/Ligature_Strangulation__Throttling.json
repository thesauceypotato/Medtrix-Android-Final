The bruises are produced by the tips or the pads of the fingers.

Persons under the influence of alcohol, epileptics, and imbeciles may be strangled by a tight scarf or collar and necktie. It may occur if an intoxicated person rests their neck against a bar or other hard object. It may occur when a string used in suspending a weight on the back slips from across the forehead and compresses the neck. In industry, belts, ropes or parts of clothing may be caught in the rollers or other parts of the moving machinery and cause accidental strangulation. Accidental strangulation may occur in the uterus when the movement of the fetus causes the umbilical cord to encircle the neck. In such cases, there is a relatively slight cervical tissue injury. Wharton's jelly is not damaged, and lungs are usually incompletely expanded.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A, C & D.
