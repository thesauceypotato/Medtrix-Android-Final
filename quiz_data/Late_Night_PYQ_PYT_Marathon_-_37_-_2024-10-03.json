C fibres</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The nerve fibre least susceptible to local anaesthetic is type C. Local anaesthetics work by blocking sodium channels, which prevents the initiation and propagation of action potentials in nerves. The effectiveness of local anaesthetics depends on the diameter and myelination of the nerve fibres.</li><li>\u2022 Type C fibres are unmyelinated and have the smallest diameter, making them the least susceptible to local anaesthetics. This means they require a higher concentration of the anaesthetic to achieve the same level of blockade as larger, myelinated fibres.</li><li>\u2022 The order of susceptibility of nerve fibres to local anaesthetics is:</li><li>\u2022 B > A-d > A-g > A-b > A-a > C</li><li>\u2022 B > A-d > A-g > A-b > A-a > C</li><li>\u2022 Nerve fibres most susceptible to local anesthetic: B fibres Nerve fibres most resistant to local anesthetic: C fibres</li><li>\u2022 Nerve fibres most susceptible to local anesthetic: B fibres</li><li>\u2022 Nerve fibres most susceptible to local anesthetic: B fibres</li><li>\u2022 B fibres</li><li>\u2022 Nerve fibres most resistant to local anesthetic: C fibres</li><li>\u2022 Nerve fibres most resistant to local anesthetic: C fibres</li><li>\u2022 C fibres</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

It is designed to minimize the work of breathing and efficiently eliminate carbon dioxide during spontaneous respiration. In the Mapleson classification, the circuits are tailored for specific purposes: Mapleson A is optimal for spontaneous breathing because the APL valve is located at the patient\u2019s end, facilitating efficient exhalation of expired gases and fresh gas flow, which reduces the risk of rebreathing. For controlled ventilation, Mapleson D (Bain\u2019s circuit) is preferred due to its distal APL valve design that supports positive pressure ventilation.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. B. Add 0.5 ml Heparin to the syringe before taking blood</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Add 0.5 ml Heparin to the syringe before taking blood: Traditionally, to prevent blood from clotting inside the syringe when obtaining an ABG, a small amount of heparin was added to the syringe. However, in contemporary practice, syringes used for ABG are pre-heparinized, which means they already contain a coating of dry heparin that will mix with the blood sample and prevent clotting. Adding additional heparin to such a syringe is unnecessary and can dilute the sample, potentially altering the results.</li><li>\u2022 Add 0.5 ml Heparin to the syringe before taking blood:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Normal pH can't rule out acid base disorder: This statement is accurate. A patient can have a mixed acid-base disorder where two primary disorders (e.g., metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis) coexist and \"cancel\" each other out, leading to a seemingly \"normal\" pH. However, when the components of the arterial blood gas (ABG) like PaCO2 and HCO3- are evaluated, abnormalities can be detected.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Normal pH can't rule out acid base disorder:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. If modified Allen\u2019s test is negative, alternate site is chosen: The modified Allen's test is a simple way to evaluate the collateral blood flow to the hand via the ulnar artery. Before taking a sample or placing an arterial line in the radial artery, it's a recommended step to ensure that if the radial artery becomes occluded, the hand will still receive adequate blood flow. If the test is negative (indicative of inadequate collateral flow), it's safer to choose an alternate site for arterial puncture.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. If modified Allen\u2019s test is negative, alternate site is chosen:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Radial artery is the preferred site: The radial artery is commonly chosen for ABG sampling and arterial line placement due to its accessibility, the presence of collateral blood flow (via the ulnar artery), and its relatively superficial location which makes puncture technically easier. Furthermore, complications like hematoma or injury are less problematic at this location when compared to other potential sites, such as the femoral artery.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

RSI is particularly valuable because it minimizes the time between the loss of protective airway reflexes and the placement of the endotracheal tube, thereby reducing the risk of aspiration.</li><li>\u2022 Preoxygenation: This step involves administering 100% oxygen for 3-5 minutes to fill the patient\u2019s lungs with oxygen, creating an oxygen reserve to minimize hypoxemia during the apneic period.</li><li>\u2022 Preoxygenation:</li><li>\u2022 Simultaneous Administration of Medications: An induction agent (e.g., etomidate, propofol, ketamine) is given to induce unconsciousness, and a neuromuscular blocking agent (e.g., succinylcholine, rocuronium) is given to achieve paralysis.

During fetal development, the receptors for growth hormone are not sufficiently developed, which limits its ability to influence growth in utero. Instead, other hormones such as insulin, thyroxine, and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are critical for intrauterine growth.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF) : IGFs, particularly IGF-2 during fetal life (and IGF 1 in adult life), play a significant role in promoting cellular growth and development.
