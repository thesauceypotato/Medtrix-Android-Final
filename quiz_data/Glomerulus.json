Net water movement may now occur from the collecting duct lumen to the hyperosmolar interstitium, decreasing urine output and conserving volume. Answer A is incorrect. A represents the apical sodium channel, which reabsorbs sodium from the collecting duct lumen. Option B. The potassium-sparing diuretics amiloride and triamterene bind and block this channel.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Glomerulo tubular balance One of the most basic mechanisms for controlling tubular reabsorption is the intrinsic ability of the tubules to increase their reabsorption rate in response to increased tubular load (increased tubular inflow). This phenomenon is referred to as glomerulotubular Thus, glomerulotubular balance refers to the fact that the total rate of reabsorption increases as the filtered load increases, even though the percentage of GFR reabsorbed in the proximal tubule remains relatively constant at about 65 percent .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Glomerulotubular balance refers to the ability of the proximal tubule and the loop of Henle to adjust their reabsorption rates in response to changes in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). When GFR increases, the rate of Na+ delivery to the proximal tubule also increases. To maintain a balance between the filtered load and the rate of reabsorption, the proximal tubule increases its rate of Na+ reabsorption. Similarly, the loop of Henle also responds to an increase in GFR by increasing its rate of Na+ reabsorption. This adaptive mechanism helps to maintain a stable Na+ balance in the body despite variations in GFR.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. Autoregulation by GFR refers to the ability of the kidneys to maintain a relatively constant GFR despite changes in blood pressure. Option C. Mineralocorticoid escape refers to the phenomenon where the body can partially or completely escape the effects of aldosterone, a hormone that regulates salt and water balance in the body. Option D. Saturation of tubular transport refers to the point at which the maximum rate of transport across a membrane has been reached.</p>\n<p></p>",

Each of the two kidneys contains about one million nephrons. The tuft is structurally supported by the mesangium (the space between the blood vessels), composed of intraglomerular mesangial cells. The blood is filtered across the capillary walls of this tuft through the glomerular filtration barrier, which yields its filtrate of water and soluble substances to a cup-like sac known as Bowman's capsule. The filtrate then enters the renal tubule of the nephron. The glomerulus receives its blood supply from an afferent arteriole of the renal arterial circulation. Unlike most capillary beds, the glomerular capillaries exit into efferent arterioles rather than venules. The resistance of the efferent arterioles causes sufficient hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus to provide the force for ultrafiltration.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Other Options:- Option A.
