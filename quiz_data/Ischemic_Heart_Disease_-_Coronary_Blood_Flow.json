In cardiac tamponade, as the cardiac chamber is strangulated, even after the opening of the tricuspid valve, blood cannot rapidly fall due to high pressure in the ventricles so the y-descent is lost. \u25cf Sharp x-descent - Relaxing of atria produces an x-descent, this x-descent becomes sharp and deeper because high blood pressure in the JVP system eventually fills the atrium when it is relaxing.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A- In cardiac tamponade, the heart is strangulated and blood will pool behind, this will raise JVP and leads to distension of the neck veins, which is also called Jugular Venous Distention (JVD) Option C- Kussmaul sign is a feature of constrictive pericarditis and not cardiac tamponade but it can be seen in some patients with cardiac tamponade. It suggests the possibility of epicardial constriction. Option D - In cardiac tamponade, cardiac chambers are compressed or strangulated. There is an increased venous return to the right heart during inspiration and the free wall of the right ventricle cannot expand due to tamponade, So there will be too much deflection of the interventricular septum towards the left side, and the left ventricle becomes extremely under filled, it leads towards the low cardiac output and eventually, there\u2019ll be more drop in systolic blood pressure (>10mmHg)\u2026.pulsus paradoxus .
