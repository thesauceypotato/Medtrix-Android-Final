Both clomipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant) and SSRIs are considered first-line pharmacological treatments for OCD.

During their internship, they both prepared for the entrance exam together. Riya got selected, but Sujoy had to prepare for another year. They eventually broke up, and Riya started dating a second-year medicine resident. Following this, Sujoy began experiencing difficulties concentrating on his studies. He continued to visit the library but struggled to focus. On a few occasions, when Sujoy saw Riya with her new boyfriend, he had trouble sleeping. However, his sleep and appetite were otherwise normal. Concerned about the impact on his studies, Sujoy sought help from a psychiatry resident. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
