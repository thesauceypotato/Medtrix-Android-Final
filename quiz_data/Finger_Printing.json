      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Leprosy MUTILATION OF FINGERPRINTS: Criminals sometimes attempt to mutilate the pattern by self-inflicted wounds or burns, applying corrosives, or erosion against a hard surface. Still, they are not destroyed unless the actual skin is wholly destroyed. They produce additional characteristics. It leaves some parts of the skin undamaged unless skin grafts are made. In most cases of coeliac disease, there is moderate epidermal ridge atrophy and even pattern loss. Incomplete atrophy of the ridges is usually seen in dermatitis. Ridge alteration occurs in eczema, acanthosis nigricans, scleroderma, and dry or atrophic skin. Permanent impairment of the fingerprint pattern occurs in leprosy, electric injury, and after radiation exposure. In infantile paralysis, rickets, and acromegaly, though the pattern is not altered, the distance between the ridges can be changed. Fingerprints are better protected than other body parts, e.g., in case of burns, fingers are bent inwards against the palm.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Poroscopy This is a further study of fingerprints, described by Locard. The ridges on fingers and hands are studded with microscopic pores formed by mouths of ducts of subepidermal sweat glands. Each millimeter of a ridge contains 9 to 18 pores. These pores number in thousands per square centimeter. These pores are permanent and unchanged during life and vary in size, shape, width, starting and stopping on occasion and branching at points, position, extent and number, distribution and arrangement of the pores over a given ridge length in each individual. This method of examining pores is called poroscopy, and is useful when only fragments of fingerprints are available in which there is no specific pattern.</p>\n<p></p>",

DNA fingerprinting (DNA typing, DNA identification, or genetic typing) involves chemically dividing the DNA into fragments that form a unique pattern and then matching that \"identity profile\" with the pattern obtained from similarly testing a suspect's blood specimen. If the two patterns match, the possibility of error, i.e., the chance that they do not belong to the same individual, maybe less than one in 30 billion. Dr. Alec Jeffreys, in 1985, developed DNA fingerprinting.</p>\n<p></p>",

Traces from the scene may be carried away on the person or tool of the criminal, and at the same time, traces from all or any of these may be left at the scene. Wherever a criminal goes, whatever he touches, and leaves will serve as silent evidence against him. e.g., fingerprints, footprints, hair, and fibers from clothes. Broken glass, tool marks, paints, scratches, blood or seminal stains, etc. It is evident, and its presence is proof of the crime.</p>\n<p></p>",
