      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Mother with a heart defect TTNB is a frequent cause of early respiratory distress in term and late-preterm infants resulting from impaired fetal lung fluid clearance. Usually, the fetal lung is filled with fluid however late in the gestational period (immediately before birth) the chloride and fluid-secreting channels in the lung epithelium are reversed so that fluid absorption predominates and fluid is removed from the lungs. Therefore neonates delivered before labour onset (elective cesarean sections, precipitous delivery) have a high risk of fluid retaining inside the lungs leading to Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTNB). The risk of Transient tachypnea of the newborn(TTNB) is also higher in infants of diabetic mothers.</p>\n<p></p>",
