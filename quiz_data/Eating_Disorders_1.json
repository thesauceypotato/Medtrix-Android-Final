Buspirone is used for a generalized anxiety disorder or social anxiety disorder. However, this patient has not reported any anxiety. Although some studies have found buspirone to be effective in decreasing binging and vomiting in patients with bulimia nervosa , it is not commonly used for this indication. Option: C. Orlistat is a pancreatic and gastric lipase inhibitor that reduces the breakdown and absorption of fat in the gastrointestinal tract. It is commonly used in binge eating disorders to induce weight loss . This patient with bulimia nervosa attempts to purge her digestive tract (following a binge) by vomiting and most likely abusing laxatives. Option: D. Mirtazapine is used in major depressive disorder , which may also present with fatigue and constipation. However, this patient is missing other signs of depression such as anhedonia, insomnia, loss of interest, and suicidal ideation. Mirtazapine is also counterproductive in bulimia nervosa because it increases appetite and can cause significant weight gain (may lead to further dietary restriction, binging, and purging).</p>\n<p></p>",

ECG changes may also result from potassium loss , which can lead to death. Gastric dilation is a rare complication of anorexia nervosa.</p>\n<p></p>",

Dialectical behavior therapy is a form of CBT tailored to help people cope with interpersonal issues. Hence it is not a treatment possibility in this condition. Explanation for all Statements:- Point 1 . Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy - has been found effective for inducing weight gain . Point 2 . Dynamic Psychotherapy - Dynamic expressive-supportive psychotherapy is sometimes used in the treatment of patients with anorexia nervosa, but their resistance may make the process difficult and painstaking. Point 3 . Family Therapy . A family analysis should be done for all patients with anorexia nervosa who are living with their families, which is used as a basis for a clinical judgment on what type of family therapy or counseling is advisable. Point 4 . Dialectical behavior therapy is a form of CBT tailored to help people cope with interpersonal issues. Hence it is not a treatment possibility in this condition. Point 5 . Pharmacotherapy - Cyprohepatidine is useful in increasing treatment efficiency in non bullimic subgroups of anorexia and impaired in bulimic subgroups. Hence in this patient(non bullimic subgroup) it is not useful.</p>\n<p></p>",
