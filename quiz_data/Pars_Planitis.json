These are best seen with indirect ophthalmoscopy and Goldman's three-mirror examination. Posterior segment signs ( pathognomic of intermediate uveitis) are: Vitreous Cells (+l to+4), Anterior vitreous condensation, Snowball or cotton ball opacities (Ant's eggs) refer to typical exudates present near the ora serrata in the inferior quadrant. Snow banking, e. grey white fibrovascular plaque over the pars plana with or without associated peripheral retinal periphlebitis forms the hallmark of intermediate uveitis. It is formed due to the coalescence of snowball opacities . These are best seen with indirect ophthalmoscopy and Goldman's three-mirror examination.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>INTERMEDIATE UVEITIS Intermediate uveitis refers to inflammation involving pars plana ciliaris, peripheral retina, choroid and vitreous base. Epidemiology Accounts for 10% of all cases of uveitis and 20% of cases of uveitis in children, \u2022 Bilateral in 80% of cases, \u2022 Males and females are equally affected, \u2022 Age: onset typically in 2nd and 4th decade (bimodal). Etiology Idiopathic in about 85% of cases. Immunogenic predisposition is reported with a positive correlation with HLA-DR2. Known causes (15% cases) include tuberculosis, syphilis, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, and multiple sclerosis. Clinical features Symptoms Asymptomatic in many cases, Floaters of insidious onset are the most common presentation , Blurring of vision and decreased vision may occur later, Pain, photophobia, and redness are conspicuously absent. Signs Anterior segment signs. Low-grade flare and cells, Few KPs due to spillover anterior uveitis, Lens may show complicated cataracts in late stages. Posterior segment signs pathognomic of intermediate uveitis Vitreous Cells (+l to+4), Anterior vitreous condensation, Snowball or cotton ball opacities (Ant's eggs) refer to typical exudates present near the ora serrata in the inferior quadrant.

It is formed due to the coalescence of snowball opacities . These are best seen with indirect ophthalmoscopy and Goldman three mirror examination Course and prognosis . Relatively good prognosis if well treated. The course is usually chronic with three distinct patterns: Single, mild self-limiting episode (10%) cases, Prolonged course without exacerbations (60% cases), and Chronic smoldering course with multiple sub-acute exacerbations (30% cases). Complications include Complicated cataracts, cystoid macular edema, band keratopathy, secondary glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, and tractional retinal detachment. Treatment : Step 1 : Periocular And Systemic Steroids. Topical steroids are not of much use. \u2022 Posterior subtenon. injection of triamcinolone 40 mg/3 weeks x 3 injections are indicated initially. \u2022 Systemic steroids are given in unresponsive cases. Step 2: Immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, or cyclophosphamide should be given with careful monitoring of effects and potential side effects when step l measures fail. Step 3 : Cryotherapy or indirect laser photocoagulation should be tried in cases with snow banking. Step 4 : Pars-plana vitrectomy is indicated in severe cases and when step 3 measures fail. It helps by removing inflammatory debris, antigenic load, and possible traction on the macula. Its role in tractional RD is unequivocal.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - The eye is usually quiet.
