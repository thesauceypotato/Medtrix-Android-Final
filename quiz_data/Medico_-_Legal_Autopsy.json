Inadequate external examination: The presence of fresh and old needle marks may be missed on cursory examination in a drug addict. Death from snake bites and insect bites cannot be explained unless the bite marks are identified. The burn may be missed in electrocution. Inadequate or improper internal examination: Air embolism and pneumothorax are often missed. Insufficient laboratory examinations. Lack of toxicological analysis. Lack of training of the doctor.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. OBSCURE AUTOPSIES are those which do not show a definite cause for death, in which there are minimal, indefinite, or obscure findings or even no positive findings at all. They are a source of confusion to any pathologist. Frequently, these deaths are due to obscure natural causes, but they may be due to certain types of injury or complications of injury, or poisoning. Mild degrees of natural disease should not be implicated unless other possibilities are most carefully eliminated. Option: C. VIRTUAL AUTOPSY (VIRTOPSY): It is a non-invasive technique of examining dead bodies to find out the cause of death. It does not destroy some important evidence that may be destroyed in the usual autopsy. It is a combination of CT and MR imaging. CT images give information about morbid anatomical findings and MR imaging demonstrates soft tissue injury, organ trauma, state of blood vessels, tissue, and bones. MR spectroscopy measures metabolites formed due to decomposition, which helps to estimate the time since death. Option: D.
