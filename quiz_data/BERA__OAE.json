It is beneficial in distinguishing between cochlear pathology and retro cochlear pathology for SNHL. Cochlear SNHL - occurs due to damage to hair cells mainly. Retrocochlear SNHL- occurs due to a lesion of the VIIIth nerve or its central connection. Hence BERA can diagnose a retro cochlear pathology.</p>\n<p></p>",
