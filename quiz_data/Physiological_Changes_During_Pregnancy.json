It is not clear as to how many and which of the primordial follicles amidst several thousands are recruited for a particular cycle. It is presumed that about 20 antral follicles (about 5\u201310 per ovary) proceed to develop in each cycle. The initial recruitment and growth of primordial follicles are not under the control of any hormone. After a certain stage (2\u20135 mm in size) the growth and differentiation of primordial follicles are under the control of FSH. Unless the follicles are rescued by FSH at this stage, they undergo atresia\u201d. Thus it is clear option a and c both are correct. Remember : For initial 60 days: Follicles are gonadotropin reistant and for later 20 days they are gonadotropin sensitive Role of AMH (anti mullerian hormone) AMH inhibits initial recruitment of primordial follicles into the pool of growing follicles. It also decreases responsiveness of follicles to FSH. AMH plays an important role for monofollicular development and ovulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The probable mechanisms for monofollicular development and ovulation All the primordial follicles that reach the preantral stage, produce AMH. AMH inhibits further growth of primordial follicles by decreasing the responsiveness of follicles to FSH. The growth of dominant follicle is uninhibited as the dominant follicle has maximum number of FSH receptors, and it produces less AMH. Coming to option \u2018d\u2019 :The basic prerequisite in ovulatory cycle is fluctuating levels of E2. If for any reason the E2 levels become static, anovulation is a rule (as in PCOS).

Fibrinogen level is raised by 50 percent from 200-400 mg/dL in nonpregnant to 300-600 mg/dL in pregnancy. As a result of rise in fibrinogen and globulin level and diminished blood viscosity, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) gives a much higher value (fourfold increase) during pregnancy. As such, ESR has got little diagnostic value in pregnancy. Platelets count, however, gives a conflicting picture. Recent studies show a static or a slight fall to the extent of 15 percent of Pre pregnant level. Gestational Thrombocytopenia may be due to haemodilution and increased platelet consumption.
