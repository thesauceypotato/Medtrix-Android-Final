Biphasic : Acute Phase : (hours) characterized by elevated counterregulatory hormones (cortisol, glucagon, adrenaline). Changes are thought to be beneficial for short-term survival Chronic Phase : (days) associated with hypothalamic suppression and low serum levels of the respective target organ hormones. Changes may contribute to chronic wasting CRF release from the hypothalamus causes ACTH to release from the pituitary and acts on the adrenals to release Cortisol. Hypothalamic activation causes sympathetic activation to release Catecholamines and also stimulates Glucagon release. However, alteration in insulin release, hypersecretion of prolactin and GH, low levels of IGF-1, inactivation of Peripheral thyroid hormones, and gonadal function also happen. Factors increase during stress response: ACTH, GH, Adrenaline, Cortisol, Glucagon, TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8. Factors decrease during stress response: Insulin, IGF-1, T3, Testosterone Purpose of Neuroendocrine changes following injury : Provide essential substrates for survival Postpone anabolism Optimize host defense These changes may be helpful in the short term but may be harmful in the long term, especially to the severely injured patient who would otherwise not have survived without medical intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Options: B, C & D: All the other hormones/factors decreases during the stress response.</p>\n<p></p>",

It involves the mobilization of body energy stores for recovery and repair and is characterized by tissue edema, high BMR, high Cardiac output, Hyperthermia, High O2 consumption, and increased Gluconeogenesis.

It calls for the aggressive use of component therapy or liquid cold stored, low titer O whole blood. The protocol was designed to enable a hospital\u2019s blood bank to improve logistic systems for the empirical use of blood components. Implementing an MTP improves survival in trauma patients . To qualify as a trauma center , the American College of Surgeons Verification Review Committee requires that all trauma centers have an MTP in place . An example of an MTP directive is that for severely injured patients, the blood bank should provide a cooler containing 4 units of type O RBCs and 4 units of AB or A plasma. If possible, a patient\u2019s blood sample should be drawn before the uncross-matched blood is transfused; even 1 unit of RBCs can sometimes interfere with crossmatching. O-negative blood is reserved for transfusing females of childbearing age when their blood type is unknown or when they are known to be Rh-. If the initial cooler of blood is utilized, the blood bank sends additional coolers containing plasma, platelets, and RBCs in a 1:1:1 ratio or coolers of whole blood.

Types: Open and Closed Open Degloving Injury : finger avulsion injury with loss of skin Closed degloving injuries result from shearing forces , which may occur with motor vehicle collisions. The extent of these injuries is often underappreciated and much of the skin may be non-viable. Disruption of perforating vascular and lymphatic vessels may result in a characteristic haemo lymphatic collection between the fascial planes called a Morel-Lavall\u00e9e lesion . Although these lesions were originally described as occurring over the greater trochanter the term is also used now for similar lesions in other anatomical locations. Diagnosis : Assessing the viability of degloved tissue can be difficult and may therefore require more than one surgical exploration and debridement before definitive reconstruction. Non-viable skin may show fixed staining and thrombosis of subcutaneous veins . Most surgeons serially excise the degloved skin until punctate dermal bleeding is seen from viable tissue. Intravenous fluorescein may also help delineate non-viable tissue , but it requires specialist equipment and there is a small risk of anaphylaxis.
