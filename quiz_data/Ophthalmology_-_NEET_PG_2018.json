      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Intravitreal antibiotic The image shows hypopyon indicator of suppuration of cystic spaces , i.e. endophthalmitis . The immediate step in management is Intravitreal antibiotic (cocktail regime) with topical steroids and cycloplegic.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Bacterial endophthalmitis: The principal sources of infection are contaminated solutions , instruments , surgeon\u2019s hands, patient\u2019s own flora from conjunctiva, eyelids and airborne bacteria. Symptoms and signs of bacterial endophthalmitis are generally present between 48 and 72 hours after surgery and include: Ocular pain, diminished vision, eyelid edema, conjunctival chemosis and marked circumciliary congestion, corneal edema, exudates in pupillary area, hypopyon and diminished or absent red pupillary glow. Management : It is an emergency and should be managed energetically. An early diagnosis and vigorous therapy is the hallmark of the treatment of endophthalmitis . Following therapeutic regime is recommended for suspected bacterial endophthalmitis. Antibiotic therapy: Intravitreal antibiotics and diagnostic tap should be made as early as possible. It is performed transconjunctival under topical anesthesia from the area of pars plana (4\u20135 mm from the limbus). The mainstay of treatment of acute bacterial endophthalmitis is intravitreal injection of antibiotics at the earliest possible. Usually a combination of two antibiotics\u2013one effective against Gram-positive coagulase negative staphylococci and the other against Gram-negative bacilli is used as below: First choice: Vancomycin 1 mg in 0.1 ml plus ceftazidime 2.25 mg in 0.1 ml. Second choice : Vancomycin 1 mg in 0.1 ml plus amikacin 0.4 mg in 0.1 ml. Third choice : Vancomycin 1 mg in 0.1 ml plus gentamycin 0.2 mg in 0.1 ml. Some surgeons prefer to add dexamethasone 4 mg in 0.1 ml to limit post inflammatory consequences. Gentamicin is 4 times more retinotoxic (causes macular infarction) than amikacin. Preferably the aminoglycosides should be avoided Steroid therapy : Steroids limit the tissue damage caused  by the inflammatory process. Most surgeons recommend their use after 24 to 48 hours of control of infection by intensive antibiotic therapy. Routes of administration and doses are: Intravitreal injection of dexamethasone 4 mg in 0.1ml. Subconjunctival injection of dexamethasone 4 mg (1ml) OD for 5-7 days. Topical dexamethasone (0.1%) or pred acetate (1%) used frequently. Systemic steroids. Oral corticosteroids should preferably be started after 24 hours of intensive antibiotic therapy. A daily therapy regime with 60 mg prednisolone to be followed by 50, 40, 30, 20 and 10 mg for 2 days each may be adopted. Supportive therapy: Cycloplegics : Preferably 1% atropine or alternatively 2% homatropine eye drops should be instilled TDS or QID. Anti glaucoma drugs: In patients with raised intraocular pressure drugs such as oral acetazolamide (250 mg TDS) and timolol (0.5% BD) may be prescribed. Vitrectomy operation: It should be performed if the patient does not improve with the above intensive therapy for 48 to 72 hours or when the patient presents with severe infection with visual acuity reduced to light perception. Vitrectomy helps in removal of infecting organisms , toxins and enzymes present in the infected vitreous mass.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Early postoperative complications after cataract surgery are: Hyphema : Collection of blood in the anterior chamber may occur from conjunctiva or sclera vessels due to minor ocular trauma or otherwise. Treatment : Most hyphemas absorb spontaneously and thus need no treatment. Sometimes hyphema may be large and associated with rise in IOP . In such cases, IOP should be lowered by acetazolamide and hyperosmotic agents . If the blood does not get absorbed in a week\u2019s time, then a paracentesis should be done to drain the blood. Iris prolapse: It is usually caused by inadequate suturing of the incision after ICCE and conventional ECCE and occurs during first or second postoperative day. Management : A small prolapse of less than 24 hours duration may be repositioned back and wound sutured. A large prolapse of long duration needs abscission and suturing of wound. Striate keratopathy: Characterised by mild corneal edema with Descemet\u2019s folds is a common complication observed during immediate postoperative period. This occurs due to endothelial damage during surgery. Management : Mild striate keratopathy usually disappears spontaneously within a week. Moderate to severe keratopathy may be treated by instillation of hypertonic saline drops (5% sodium chloride) along with steroids . Flat (shallow or non formed ) anterior chamber: It has become a relatively rare complication due to improved wound closure. It may be due to wound leak, ciliochoroidal detachment or pupil block. Postoperative anterior uveitis can be induced by instrumental trauma, undue handling of uveal tissue , reaction to residual cortex or chemical reaction induced by viscoelastic, pilocarpine, etc. Management : Includes more aggressive use of topical steroids, cycloplegics and NSAIDs.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA PATHOGENESIS OF POST OP ENDOPHTHALMITIS</p>\n<p></p>",

However, it should be estimated individually in each eye in order to determine how much is necessary to provide a comfortable range. Basic principles for presbyopic correction are: Always find refractive error for distance and first correct it. Find out the presbyopic correction needed in each eye separately and add it to the distant correction. Near point should be fixed by taking due consideration for the profession of the patient. The weakest convex lens with which an individual can see clearly at the near point should be prescribed, since overcorrection will also result in asthenopic symptoms.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Floor Bony orbit: The bony orbits are quadrangular truncated pyramids situated between the anterior cranial fossa above and the maxillary sinuses below . Each orbit is about 40 mm in height , width and depth and is formed by portions of seven bones : (1) frontal, (2) maxilla, (3) zygomatic, (4) sphenoid, (5) palatine, (6) ethmoid and (7) lacrimal. It has four walls (medial, lateral, superior and inferior), base and an apex. The medial walls of two orbits are parallel to  each  other and being thinnest are frequently fractured during injuries as well as during orbitotomy operations , and it also accounts for ethmoiditis being the most common cause of orbital cellulitis. The inferior orbital wall (floor) is triangular in shape and being quite thin is commonly involved in blowout fractures and is easily invaded by tumors of the maxillary antrum. The lateral wall of the orbit is triangular in shape . It covers only the posterior half of the eyeball. Therefore, palpation of the retrobulbar tumours is easier from this side. Because of its advantageous anatomical position , a surgical approach to the orbit by lateral orbitotomy is popular. The roof is triangular in shape and is formed mainly by the orbital plate of frontal bone. Base of the orbit is the anterior open end of the orbit. It is bounded by thick orbital margins.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>SIGNS:- Periorbital haematoma: also proposis of variable degree seen initially due to orbital edema and hemorrhage Emphysema : Subcutaneous emphysema with crepitus seen in fractures communicating with air filled sinuses. Paraesthesia over the ipsilateral lower lid, cheek and upper lip due to injury to the infraorbital nerve. Diplopia : Due to restriction of ocular motility. With the entrapment of inferior orbital tissue and inferior rectus muscle, vertical diplopia is more prominent in upgaze. Visual loss can result from globe trauma, injury to the optic nerve, or increased orbital pressure causing a compartment syndrome An orbital hemorrhage should be suspected if loss of vision is associated with proposis and increased 1OP.

Refractive types of regular astigmatism: Depending upon the position of the two focal lines in relation to retina , the regular astigmatism is further classified into three types: Simple astigmatism :- wherein the rays are focused on the retina in one meridian and either in front (simple myopic astigmatism) or behind (simple hypermetropic astigmatism) the retina in the other meridian. Compound astigmatism: In this type, the rays of light in both the meridian are focused either in front or behind the retina and the condition is labelled as compound myopia or compound hypermetropic astigmatism, respectively. Mixed astigmatism:- refers to a condition wherein the light rays in one meridian are focused in front and in another meridian behind the retina. Thus in one meridian eye is myopic and in another hypermetropic. Such patients have comparatively less symptoms as \u2018circle of least diffusion \u2019 is formed on the retina Treatment: Optical treatment of regular astigmatism comprises the pre- scribing appropriate cylindrical lens, discovered after accurate refraction. Spectacles with full correction of cylindrical power and appropriate axis should be used for distance and near vision. Contact lenses: Rigid contact lenses may correct upto 2\u20133 of regular astigmatism , while soft contact lenses can correct only little astigmatism. For higher degrees of astigmatism toric contact lenses are needed. In order to maintain the correct axis of toric lenses, ballasting or truncation is required.
