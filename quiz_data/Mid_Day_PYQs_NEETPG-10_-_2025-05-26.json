Subthalamic nuclei</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 Most probable diagnosis as per the clinical history is hemiballismus which is caused by a lesion in subthalamic nuclei.</li><li>\u2022 Hemiballismus is a disorder characterized by violent involuntary abnormal movements on one side of the body involving mostly the arm. While walking, the arm swings widely. These movements are called the flinging movements. These movements are due to the release phenomenon because of the absence of inhibitory influence on movements. Hemiballismus occurs due to degeneration of subthalamic nucleus of Luys.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Globus pallidus : Incorrect for hemiballismus. Lesions here typically result in different forms of dyskinesia, such as parkinsonism or dystonia, but not hemiballismus.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Globus pallidus</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Putamen : Also incorrect for this symptom. While putamen lesions are involved in many movement disorders, like Huntington's disease and some forms of Parkinson's disease, they do not typically cause hemiballismus.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Putamen</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Caudate nucleus : Incorrect. Lesions in the caudate nucleus are more often associated with Huntington's disease, which leads to chorea\u2014rapid, jerky movements\u2014not the large-amplitude flinging movements seen in hemiballismus.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Caudate nucleus</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 For a patient presenting with unilateral flinging, violent limb movements following a stroke, the subthalamic nuclei should be considered as the primary site of lesion. This knowledge is crucial for accurate diagnosis and guiding treatment decisions, such as the use of neuroleptics or other interventions to control these disruptive movements.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
