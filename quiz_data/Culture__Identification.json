Obligate anaerobes are organisms that can only live in environments that lack oxygen. Obligate anaerobes cannot tolerate oxygen because they utilize metabolic schemes built around enzymes that react with oxidants. The reliance upon low-potential flavoproteins for anaerobic respiration probably causes substantial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide to be produced when anaerobes are exposed to air. Obligate anaerobes lack superoxide dismutase and catalase and/or peroxidase and therefore undergo lethal oxidations by various oxygen radicals when they are exposed to O2 (OPTION A, B, and D). Aerotolerant anaerobes: They do not utilize oxygen for growth, but tolerate its presence. This is because they possess small amounts of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase (but lack catalase) which may neutralize the toxic oxygen radicals.

Agar: It is used for solidifying the culture media. It has no nutritional properties. It is prepared from seaweeds (red algae of species Gelidium and Gracilaria).
