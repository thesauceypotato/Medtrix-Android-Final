      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Poroscopy The ridges on fingers and hands are studded with microscopic pores, formed by mouths of ducts of subepidermal sweat glands. Each millimetre of a ridge contains 9 to 18 pores. These pores are permanent and unchanged during their lifetime and vary in size, shape, width, starting, and stopping on occasion and branching at points, position, extent and number, distribution and arrangement of the pores over a given length of the ridge in each individual. This method of examining pores is called poroscopy and is useful when only fragments of fingerprints are available in which there is no specific pattern.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Cheiloscopy is the study of lip prints. It has nothing to do with impressions or fingerprints Option: C & D. William's and Locard's method is not related to chance impressions obtained from the crime scene in this question.</p>\n<p></p>",
