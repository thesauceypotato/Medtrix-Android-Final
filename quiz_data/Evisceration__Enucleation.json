      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Endophthalmitis, Penetration ocular trauma, Expulsive choroidal hemorrhage. It is the removal of the contents of the eyeball leaving behind the sclera . Frill evisceration is preferred over simple evisceration . In it, only about a 3-mm frill of the sclera is left around the optic nerve. Evisceration Removal of the contents of the eye, while maintaining an intact scleral shell attached to the extraocular muscles Exenteration Removal of the globe along with all the soft tissues of the orbit, eyeball, fat, muscles Enucleation Removal of the eyeball, but the adjacent structures of the eye socket and eyelids remain Advantages of Evisceration over Enucleation Shorter operative time More cost efficient A technically simpler procedure A less invasive procedure (important in cases when GA is contraindicated or in bleeding disorders) Less disruption of orbital tissues chance of injury to EOM,nerves and fat atrophy reduced Relationships between the muscles, globe, eyelids, and fornices remain undisturbed Less chance of spread of infection to nervous system Indications . These include: Panophthalmitis, Endophthalmitis Penetrating ocular trauma Blind, painful eye Expulsive choroidal hemorrhage Bleeding anterior staphyloma</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Endophthalmitis, Penetration ocular trauma, Intraocular malignancy - panophthalmitis is the correct indication. Option: B. Expulsive choroidal hemorrhage, bleeding ant. Staphyloma, phthisis bulbi - phthisis bulbi is not included. Option: C. Endophthalmitis, bleeding ant. Staphyloma, micro-ophthalmia - micro ophthalmia is not included.</p>\n<p></p>",
