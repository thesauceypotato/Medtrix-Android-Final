There are two methods for localization of the facial nerve trunk: Anterograde method: The facial nerve trunk is identified based on the anatomical landmarks after it exits from the stylomastoid foramen. This includes: -Tragal pointer/Conley's pointer - It is the inferior portion of the cartilaginous canal. The facial nerve trunk lies 1 cm deep and inferior to its tip. Posterior belly of digastric - The facial nerve lies superior to The upper border of The muscle. Squamotympanic fissure - It is a fissure in The temporal bone, which runs from TMJ to The tympanic cavity. The facial nerve runs through this fissure. Styloid process - The facial nerve lies superficial to it. Mastoid process - Upon drilling It, The nerve is identified proximally. Retrograde method: the main branches of the facial nerve trunks are identified and are then traced proximally until the main trunk is identified. Some branches used for tracing the facial nerve trunk include the Buccal branch: which lies in relation to the parotid gland. Marginal mandibular branch - it lies in relation to the facial vessels.</p>\n<p></p>",
