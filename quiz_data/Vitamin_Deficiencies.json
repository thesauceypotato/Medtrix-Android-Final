      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Mutation in vitamin D receptor The given case scenario is vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2. It is an autosomal recessive disorder.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>It\u2019s due to a mutation in the gene vitamin D receptor. It shows normal 25 OH D3 , increased 1,25 OH D3. This leads to the virtual abolition of action of 1,25OHD3 , despite its marked raised levels in circulation. Early onset of rickets, a high prevalence of alopecia and ectodermal defects (oligodontia, milia, epidermal cysts) are characteristics. Hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, increased circulatory levels of 1,25OHD3 and absence or decreased response to vitamin D analogues are seen. Vitamin D-dependent rickets type 1: a condition characterised by a d eficiency of enzyme 25 , hydroxy D 1 alpha-hydroxylase. It reduces blood calcium levels, and normal to low phosphate and increased alkaline phosphatase levels are characteristics. Blood levels of 25 OH D3A are normal, but 1,25 OH are markedly decreased despite hypocalcemia. Clinical features include rickets, hypotonia, growth failure, motor retardation, convulsions due to hypocalcemia, anaemia and occasional respiratory difficulties Familial hypophosphatemic rickets: the gene for x-linked hypophosphatemic rickets is termed the PHEX gene, producing an endopeptidase. This enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of FGF23 , and enzyme deficiency leads to high FGF23 and excessive renal loss of phosphate. FGF23 also decreases the activity of renal 1 alpha hydroxylase. Therefore blood levels of 1,25OHD3 are low despite hypophosphatemia. Clinical features are lower limb deformities, coca vara, genu valgum and genu varum and short stature. Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets have a mutation in the gene encoding the FGF23 gene.</p>\n<p></p>",
