In utero, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons develop in the olfactory placode. These neurons migrate through the forebrain to the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus by 11 weeks\u2019 gestation. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a decapeptide, is influenced by higher cortical centers and is released from these neurons in a pulsatile fashion into the pituitary portal plexus. As a result, by mid gestation, the GnRH \u201cpulse generator\u201d stimulates secretion of gonadotropins, that is, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), from the anterior pituitary. In turn, the pulsatile release of gonadotropins stimulates ovarian synthesis and release of gonadal steroid hormones. Concurrently, accelerated germ cell division and follicular development begins, resulting in the creation of 6 to 7 million oocytes by 5 months\u2019 gestation. By late gestation, gonadal steroids exert negative feedback on secretion of both hypothalamic GnRH and pituitary gonadotropins. During this time, oocyte number decreases through a process of gene related apoptosis to reach a level of 1 to 2 million by birth At birth, FSH and LH concentrations rise abruptly in response to the fall in placental estrogen levels and are highest in the first 3 months of life. This transient rise in gonadotropin levels is followed by an increase in gonadal steroid concentrations, which is thought to explain instances of neonatal breast budding, minor bleeding from endometrial shedding, short-lived ovarian cysts, and transient white vaginal mucous discharge. Following these initial months, gonadotropin levels gradually decline to reach prepubertal levels by age 1 to 2 years. The childhood years are thus characterized by low plasma levels of FSH, LH, and estradiol. Estradiol levels typically measure < 10 pg/mL, and LH values are < 0.3 mIU/mL.</li><li>\u2022 A carefully orchestrated cascade of events unfolds in the neuroendocrine system and regulates development of the female reproductive system.</li><li>\u2022 In utero, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons develop in the olfactory placode.</li><li>\u2022 These neurons migrate through the forebrain to the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus by 11 weeks\u2019 gestation.</li><li>\u2022 Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a decapeptide, is influenced by higher cortical centers and is released from these neurons in a pulsatile fashion into the pituitary portal plexus.</li><li>\u2022 As a result, by mid gestation, the GnRH \u201cpulse generator\u201d stimulates secretion of gonadotropins, that is, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), from the anterior pituitary.</li><li>\u2022 In turn, the pulsatile release of gonadotropins stimulates ovarian synthesis and release of gonadal steroid hormones.</li><li>\u2022 Concurrently, accelerated germ cell division and follicular development begins, resulting in the creation of 6 to 7 million oocytes by 5 months\u2019 gestation.</li><li>\u2022 By late gestation, gonadal steroids exert negative feedback on secretion of both hypothalamic GnRH and pituitary gonadotropins.</li><li>\u2022 During this time, oocyte number decreases through a process of gene related apoptosis to reach a level of 1 to 2 million by birth</li><li>\u2022 At birth, FSH and LH concentrations rise abruptly in response to the fall in placental estrogen levels and are highest in the first 3 months of life.</li><li>\u2022 This transient rise in gonadotropin levels is followed by an increase in gonadal steroid concentrations, which is thought to explain instances of neonatal breast budding, minor bleeding from endometrial shedding, short-lived ovarian cysts, and transient white vaginal mucous discharge.</li><li>\u2022 Following these initial months, gonadotropin levels gradually decline to reach prepubertal levels by age 1 to 2 years.</li><li>\u2022 The childhood years are thus characterized by low plasma levels of FSH, LH, and estradiol.</li><li>\u2022 Estradiol levels typically measure < 10 pg/mL, and LH values are < 0.3 mIU/mL.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 A carefully orchestrated cascade of events unfolds in the neuroendocrine system and regulates development of the female reproductive system.
