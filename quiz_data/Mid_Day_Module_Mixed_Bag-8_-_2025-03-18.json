It is named after Jacques Lisfranc, a French surgeon who described amputations through this region during the Napoleonic Wars. The Lisfranc joint complex also includes the articulation between the other cuneiform bones and the metatarsals, as well as the tarsometatarsal ligaments and interosseous ligaments. The Lisfranc ligament is important for maintaining stability of the midfoot and for transferring forces from the hindfoot to the forefoot during walking and running.
