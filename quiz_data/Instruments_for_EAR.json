They can be elicited by a very sensitive microphone placed in the external ear canal and analysed by a computer. The sound produced by outer hair cells travels in a reverse direction: outer hair cells \u2192basi- lar membrane \u2192 perilymph \u2192 oval window \u2192 ossicles \u2192 tympanic membrane \u2192 ear canal. OAEs are present when outer hair cells are healthy and are absent when they are damaged and thus help to test the function of the cochlea. Uses OAEs are used as a screening test for hearing in neonates and to test hearing in uncooperative or mentally challenged individuals after sedation. Sedation does not interfere with OAEs. They help to distinguish cochlear from retrocochlear hearing loss. OAEs are absent in cochlear lesions, e.g. ototoxic sensorineural hearing loss. They detect ototoxic effects earlier than pure tone audiometry. OAEs are also helpful in diagnosing retrocochlear pathology, especially auditory neuropathy. OAEs are absent in 50% of normal individuals, lesions of the cochlea, middle ear disorders (as sound travelling in the reverse direction cannot be picked up) and when a hearing loss exceeds 30 dB.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Gille\u2019s Test The instrument shown in the image is the Siegel speculum. It may be used in Gille\u2019s test.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Gelle\u2019s test . It is also a test of bone conduction and examines the effect of increased air pressure in the ear canal on hearing. Usually, when air pressure is increased in the ear canal by Siegel\u2019s speculum, it pushes the tympanic membrane and ossicles inwards, raises the intralabyrinthine pressure and causes immobility of the basilar membrane and decreased hearing. Still, no change in hearing is observed when the ossicular chain is \ufb01xed or disconnected.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B . Bing test is a test of bone conduction and examines the effect of occlusion of the ear canal on hearing. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the mastoid while the examiner alternately closes and opens the ear canal by pressing the tragus inwards. A normal person or one with sensorineural hearing loss hears louder when the ear canal is occluded and softer when the canal is open (Bing positive). A patient with conductive hearing loss will appreciate no change (Bing negative). Option C. In Schwabach\u2019s test BC of the patient is compared with that of the normal hearing person (examiner), but the meatus is not occluded. It has the same signi\ufb01cance as the absolute bone conduction test. Schwabach is reduced in sensorineural deafness and lengthened in conductive deafness. Option D . In the Rinne test, air conduction of the ear is compared with its bone conduction. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the patient\u2019s mastoid, and when he stops hearing, it is brought beside the meatus. If he still hears, AC is more than BC. Rinne's test is positive when AC is longer or louder than BC. It is seen in normal persons or those having sensorineural deafness. A negative Rinne (BC > AC) is seen in conductive deafness.</p>\n<p></p>",
