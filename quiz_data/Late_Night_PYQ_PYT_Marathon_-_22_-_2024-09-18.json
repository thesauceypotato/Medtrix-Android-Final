D) Admit and give IV ceftriaxone and IV levofloxacin</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 This patient is likely suffering from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and presents with confusion, fever, cough with rales, and tachypnea. Given his age (65 years) and symptoms, a CURB-65 score calculation is necessary. The CURB-65 score assigns points based on confusion, urea level, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age \u2265 65. Here, the patient scores at least 3 points (confusion, tachypnea, age \u2265 65), indicating a need for hospital admission and potentially ICU care.</li><li>\u2022 In managing CAP with a high CURB-65 score, empirical antibiotic therapy typically includes a combination of a beta-lactam (like ceftriaxone) and a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (like levofloxacin). This combination is chosen to cover the most common pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and atypical bacteria.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Admit and give IV levofloxacin: Levofloxacin alone is a potent respiratory fluoroquinolone but may not provide sufficient broad-spectrum coverage</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Admit and give IV levofloxacin:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Treat at home with oral Amox-clav: Given the patient's high CURB-65 score, home treatment is inappropriate. Oral antibiotics like Amox-clav are insufficient for severe CAP needing hospitalization.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Treat at home with oral Amox-clav:</li><li>\u2022 Option C.  Admit and give IV ceftriaxone: While IV ceftriaxone is effective against many CAP pathogens, the addition of IV levofloxacin provides better coverage, especially for atypical organisms.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

The elevated pCO2 of 60 mmHg (normal: 35-45 mmHg) points to a respiratory cause of the acidosis, specifically respiratory acidosis. In COPD patients, chronic CO2 retention is common, leading to increased bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels as a compensatory mechanism. However, in acute respiratory acidosis, the metabolic compensation is typically inadequate, as seen by the HCO3- level of 28 mEq/L (normal: 22-28 mEq/L). The inadequate compensation suggests an acute exacerbation rather than a chronic condition, as chronic respiratory acidosis would have a more elevated bicarbonate level (>30 mEq/L).</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

This dysfunction leads to ineffective clearing of mucus from the respiratory tract, resulting in recurrent respiratory infections, chronic sinusitis, and situs inversus. In males, the ciliary dysfunction extends to the sperm flagella, leading to abnormal sperm motility, which is a primary cause of infertility in these patients despite normal sperm count.

This organism is often implicated because it commonly colonizes the oral cavity and can enter the bloodstream during dental procedures or other transient bacteremias, leading to infection of the prosthetic valve.

Staphylococcus epidermidis Staphylococcus epidermidis, a coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CONS), is the leading cause of early prosthetic valve endocarditis, typically occurring within the first 2 months post-surgery.
