Adults: Parkland formula for second and third-degree burns. Fluid resuscitation: Should be tailored to urine output; the calculated fluid requirement is from the time of the burn. Timing: First 50% of the fluid is given in the initial 8 hours, with the rest in the remaining 16 hours. Urinary catheter: Placed to monitor urine output. Parkland formula or burn resuscitation: 4 mL X total body surface area burned (TBSA) X weight (kg) = estimated fluid requirements in the first 24 hours. So from question fluid required = 4 X 40 X 50 = 8000 mL So for 1st hour, 4 liters is given.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Resuscitation fluid should commence from the time of burn injury, and any delay must be caught up. Intravenous resuscitation is appropriate for adults with burns more significant than 15% TBSA and children with burns more critical than 10% TBSA . Some countries commence intravenous fluid resuscitation at 30% TBSA depending on the available resources. Oral resuscitation may be necessary, but additional salt solutions are required to avoid fatal hyponatremia and water intoxication . Three variables affect fluid requirements : percentage of TBSA burned, patient weight, and rate/type of fluid. Three primary fluids are used in resuscitation: crystalloid (most common), colloid , and hypertonic saline , each with advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The modified Parkland formula is widely used for fluid resuscitation in burns. The formula is administered over 24 hours, with the first half given in 8 hours and the second over 16 hours. Maintenance fluid (dextrose-saline) should also be given in children, with varying doses based on body weight. Crystalloid resuscitation may lead to increased tissue edema due to its requirement for eight-fold more significant volumes than colloid.</p>\n<p></p>",

PCNL/URS manages rests. EXTRACORPOREAL SHOCKWAVE LITHOTRIPSY (ESWL, ESL) : This is a non-invasive method of treating urinary tract stones by generating shockwaves outside the body focused on the rocks. It was first used on humans in Germany in 1980. Different shock wave generation methods include spark gap, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and micro-expulsive. Shockwaves generated using the spark-gap method must be coordinated with the patient\u2019s electrocardiogram (ECG) to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. Stones can be localized for treatment using either fluoroscopy or USS. This is the standard form of treatment for renal calculi, and stones up to approximately 1.5 cm in size are suitable for this treatment. More than one treatment session may be needed to treat the stone, especially if it is sizeable. Prophylactic antibiotics are used to prevent infection as bacteria often colonize rocks. Cystine stones are relatively resistant to ESWL due to their hardness. In addition to infection, ESWL may result in haematuria, parenchymal bleeding, and even perirenal hematoma. Contraindications to ESWL are obese patients, pregnant patients, and patients taking oral anticoagulants.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The efficacy of SWL reduces with an increasing number of stones and volume of stone burden.

Vit B 1 Chaga\u2019s disease. It is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, which is common in South America called sleeping sickness. Diffuse esophageal spasm (Corkscrew esophagus). Most commonly, it is idiopathic . There is degeneration of Auerbach\u2019s myenteric plexus along the entire length of the esophagus, especially in LOS. There is a pencil-shaped narrowing of the cardio (O-G junction) with enormous dilatation of the proximal esophagus, which contains foul-smelling fluid and is more prone to aspiration pneumonia. Achalasia cardia is a precancerous condition\u2014seven times chance of getting squamous cell carcinoma (8%, after 15 years). Pathology: Thickening of circular muscle fibers in the distal esophagus. Myenteric inflammation; depletion of ganglion cells; neural fibrosis; reduced nitric oxide and Vasoactive intestinal peptide [mediators of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation]. Absence of peristalsis; raised LES pressure; failure of relaxation with functional obstruction of the esophagogastric junction. Dilatation of proximal esophagus with atony. Clinical Features: Common in females between 20 and 40 years age group. Incidence is 6 per 1,00,000 population. Chest pain occurs in the early stage. Achalasia with diffuse esophageal spasm is called as \u2018 vigorous achalasia.\u2019 Presents with progressive dysphagia, which is more for liquid than to solid food. Regurgitation and recurrent pneumonia are common (10%). Walking while eating, chin thrusting, neck and shoulder extension, Valsalva maneuver facilitates emptying of food from the esophagus.

It shows the failure of LES to relax entirely during swallowing and the complete absence of peristalsis. LES pressure is > 35 mm Hg. Baseline esophageal pressure will be high without progressive esophageal peristalsis with low amplitude muscular tone. Intra esophageal pressure about intragastric pressure is elevated. Esophagoscopy is done to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out carcinoma esophagus. It shows closed LES with atonic, dilated proximal esophagus. A biopsy of mucosa at LES should be done.

Achalasia refers to the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax . Both the muscle of the esophagus and LES are affected. The prevailing theory suggests that the destruction of the nerves to LES is the primary pathology, and degeneration of the neuromuscular function of the body of the esophagus is secondary. It is a premalignant condition that may lead to squamous cell carcinoma. Achalasia can be seen in Triple-A syndrome or Allgrove disease , which involves Achalasia, lacrimal, and ACTH-resistant Adrenal insufficiency . It is caused by progressive inflammation and selective loss of inhibitory myenteric neurons in Auerbach\u2019s plexus of the esophagus that generally secrete VIP and nitric oxide . This results in the failure to relax LES and peristalsis of the esophageal body, leading to functional obstruction at the level of the GE junction and gradual dilatation of the esophagus.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Treatment options for Achalasia Cardia : Early stage : Sublingual nitroglycerin, nitrates, or calcium channel blockers can provide temporary relief of chest pressure before or after a meal. Bougie dilation up to 54 French may offer several months of relief but requires repeated dilations to be sustainable. Botulinum toxin injection directly into the LES can relax the LES and provide symptomatic relief for years, but symptoms may recur more than 50% of the time within six months. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy is the preferred surgical option , where the extent of myotomy is 2 cm above the GE junction to 1 cm below, over the stomach. A partial antireflux procedure (Toupet or Dor fundoplication) can be performed to restore a barrier to reflux and decrease postoperative symptoms. Esophagectomy may be considered for megaesophagus, sigmoid esophagus, failure of multiple myotomies, or an undeletable reflux stricture .</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>FNAC by endoscopic ultrasound Clinical Presentation and Evaluation of pancreatic carcinoma: The signs and symptoms of pancreatic carcinoma relate to the location of the tumor and the effects of the tumor on local structures. Periampullary tumors often present early with painless jaundice. Most patients have a combination of weight loss, jaundice, and pain due to infiltration of the tumor into the peripancreatic region, including retroperitoneal nerves carried through the celiac plexus. Invasion of these nerves by tumor often results in pain that is constant, posterior, and epigastric in distribution with radiation to the back as opposed to the intermittent colicky pain usually associated with biliary tract disease. A palpable non-tender gallbladder associated with painless jaundice is more commonly associated with malignancy (Courvoisier\u2019s sign) . In contrast, cholecystitis or obstructive jaundice due to choledocholithiasis is typically painful and associated with tenderness on examination. The evaluation of jaundiced patients includes serum chemistries. Markedly elevated transaminases (AST, ALT near 1000) suggest hepatitis. Elevation of the total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and \u03b3-GGT suggest obstructive jaundice. Transaminases may be mildly elevated into the low hundreds. Liver function studies suggesting obstructive jaundice demand further imaging studies that should begin with ultrasonography. Ultrasound is useful in diagnosing a dilated or obstructed biliary ductal system, liver lesions, cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, cholecystitis, and in some cases, pancreatic neoplasms. In patients with a history and physical findings suggestive of a pancreatic neoplasm, CT may be a more informative initial diagnostic test. CT provides information about the level of the biliary tract obstruction, delineates the mass and its relation to vital structures, and identifies liver metastases. A high-quality, contrast-enhanced CT scan is required to stage the lesion preoperatively and to determine tumor resectability as defined by the absence of distant spread of disease, ascites, and lack of involvement of the SMV, portal vein (PV), SMA, hepatic artery, vena cava or aorta. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the newest modality for evaluating pancreatic lesions. Its sensitivity and specificity are similar to CT's in evaluating the mass and adjacent vasculature. It is not useful for evaluating liver metastases. EUS, unlike CT, however, is invasive and highly operator dependent. MRCP, ERCP, and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) can also delineate biliary and pancreatic ductal anatomy. Palliative drainage of the biliary tract to address symptoms due to hyperbilirubinemia can also be achieved endoscopically or transhepatically in unresectable cases. Still, preoperative drainage of the biliary system is not routinely indicated when imaging studies suggest a resectable pancreatic tumor. Likewise, a biopsy of a pancreatic mass in resectable cases is not indicated due to a high false negative rate and difficulty in establishing the diagnosis. Biopsy and tissue diagnosis are important if neoadjuvant or palliative chemotherapy or radiation therapy is to be undertaken and may be obtained by percutaneous CT or EUS-guided methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Carcinoma Pancreas is a type of cancer that originates in the pancreas, with the most common type being pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Most PDAC cases occur in the head of the pancreas, with a smaller percentage occurring in the body and tail. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure used to obtain cells for examination under a microscope. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a technique that uses a special endoscope with an ultrasound probe attached to it to obtain detailed images of the pancreas and surrounding structures. FNAC by EUS involves passing a small needle through the endoscope and into the pancreas to obtain a sample of cells for examination. The procedure is done under real-time guidance, which increases accuracy and reduces the risk of complications. FNAC by EUS has been shown to have a high accuracy rate for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, with a sensitivity of up to 85% and a specificity of up to 98%.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>During an examination, physicians should look for signs of jaundice, weight loss, a palpable liver, and a palpable gallbladder. Courvoisier first noticed the association between an enlarged gallbladder and pancreatic tumors in 1890. Patients with a recent diabetes diagnosis and upper abdominal symptoms, especially those above 50 years of age with no family history or obesity, should be suspected of having pancreatic tumors. Unexplained pancreatitis may also be a sign of tumors and should be followed up with imaging.</p>\n<p></p>",

Splenic artery aneurysm is the second most common Incidence is 2%. It is more common in males. Transverse diameter of the aorta in an aneurysm should be 3 cm or more. Common in the elderly; common in males (4:1); the chance of getting an aneurysm in genetically related first-degree relatives is ten times more. Common in smokers (8:1 with non-smokers); in 55% of patients Chlamydia pneumoniae is identified. Causes: Atherosclerosis (as a degenerative process) is the most common facilitating cause (95%)\u2014aortic wall contains smooth muscle cell matrix, elastin, collagen; elastin (in tunica media) is the main load-; part with collagen (in adventitia) as a safety net in the wall to provide tensile strength preventing aneurysm formation. Elastin in the medial layer of the aorta is degraded and reduced significantly in the infrarenal aorta concerning collagen, absence or fewer vasa vasorum in the infrarenal aorta, and atherosclerotic instability of the medial wall of the aorta causes infrarenal aorta more prone to develop an aneurysm. Increased proteolytic activity of the medial aortic wall due to increased matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) (derived from aortic smooth muscle cells and macrophages) cause elastin and collagen degradation and increase in the diameter of the aneurysm. Collagen degradation in adventitia causes rupture. Familial aortic aneurysm (associated with 25% of AAA) is more prevalent in females to reduce male to female ratio to 2:1. It is related to a decrease in type III collagen, \u03b11 antitrypsin, and lysyl oxidase. Marfan\u2019s, and Ehler-Danlos syndromes are related genetically. Others: Syphilis, dissection, trauma, collagen diseases, infection, arthritis, cystic medial necrosis, association with Chlamydia pneumoniae (55%). Classification I: Infrarenal\u2014most common 95%. Suprarenal\u20145%. Isolated suprarenal type is rare; it is usually associated with thoracic and or infrarenal types. Classification II: Symptomatic ruptured. Asymptomatic aortic aneurysm is a condition where the aorta, the largest artery in the body, bulges or balloons out but does not cause any symptoms. The decision to operate on an asymptomatic aortic aneurysm depends on its size, location, and growth rate. The current guideline from the American Heart Association recommends that elective repair of an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm be considered when the aneurysm is greater than or equal to 5.5 cm (55 mm) in diameter. This recommendation is based on research that shows a significant increase in the risk of rupture when the diameter of an aortic aneurysm exceeds 5.5 cm. For thoracic aortic aneurysms , the threshold for elective repair may be lower, depending on the location and other factors. Investigations: Blood urea, serum creatinine. U/S ( most widely used noninvasive test; but neck of the aneurysm, dimensions, and relation to renal arteries are difficult to assess), aortogram, DSA, CT scan ( most precise ). U/S is an effective screening tool . Screening is done in cardiovascular patients in men (60-85 years), in women (60-85 years); men and women above 50 years with family history; annually in asymptomatic AAA with 4.0-4.5 cm size, with size > 4.5 cm once in every six months. CT angiogram, MR angiogram. Blood sugar, and lipid profile. Other relevant investigations like echocardiography, cardiac and pulmonary assessment. X-ray will show eggshell CT scan is a more reliable and precise investigation of choice and gives better information regarding the extent of sides/neck, size, dimensions, size and site of the thrombus, calcification, relation of renal arteries, inflammation and fibrosis, and adjacent tissues. MRI may be better only in renal failure patients. Complications of abdominal aortic aneurysm: Rupture, infection Thrombosis, embolism Distal ischemia/gangrene Aortocaval fistula formation Aortoenteric fistula Erosion of vertebra Spinal cord ischemia when thrombosis develops Differential Diagnosis: Retroperitoneal mass, pseudocyst of the pancreas, retroperitoneal cyst mimic abdominal aortic aneurysm especially when it is thrombosed. Mesenteric ischemia, acute pancreatitis, and perforated duodenal ulcer may mimic ruptured aneurysm. Other conditions causing back pain like disc prolapse, [p]and sciatica. Treatment: Conservative/Medical Treatment It is done in low-risk abdominal aortic aneurysm (age below 70 years; active physically without cardiac, respiratory, renal impairment and noninflammatory aneurysm); if aneurysm size is < 5 cm; if growth rate is < 0.5 cm/year. It includes risk factor modifications; stopping smoking; control of blood pressure (propranolol), cholesterol; usage of drugs\u2014alpha blockers, elastase inhibitors (NSAID\u2014indo- methacin), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) inhibitor (doxycycline). Periodic size measurement of an aneurysm using ultra- sound once in 6 months to find out growth rate is essential during conservative treatment. Surgical Treatment: Indications for surgery are: Asymptomatic aneurysm more than 5.5 cm. Growth rate more than 0.5 cm/year. Painful, tender aneurysm. Thrombosed aneurysm, aneurysm with distal emboli.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Documented aneurysmal enlargement and symptoms caused by the aneurysm are indications for surgery. An aneurysm detected in a woman who anticipates pregnancy should be removed, and one detected during pregnancy should be removed before the third trimester. Proximal aneurysms are excised after proximal and distal ligations. Mid-splenic aneurysms are excluded by proximal and distal ligations of the splenic artery and all collateral vessels. The most common type of splenic artery aneurysm, the distal or hilar aneurysm, is treated with aneurysmectomy and splenectomy.</p>\n<p></p>",

It can occur in genitalia or in axilla (more apocrine glands). In 25% of cases, the condition is associated with an underlying in situ or invasive carcinoma. Presentation is like red plaque/white/ depigmented areas/crusts/scales mimicking dermatitis, eczema, fungal infections. Condition is often associated with GI or urinary malignancies (40%). Biopsy of lesion, CT evaluation for other malignancies, wide local excision and radiotherapy\u2014are the management principles. It is a rare extramammary disease, is comparable to intraductal carcinoma of the breasts, because the apocrine sweat  glands are involved. It occurs in a postmenopausal woman as a sharply demarcated and slightly elevated white indurated or eczematous lesion and causes pruritus. The biopsy reveals the characteristic large pale vacuolated cells in the epidermis (See Figure below) . Perianal and perineal areas are rarely involved. The Paget\u2019s cells are adenocarcinomatous mucus-secreting cells, round cells with pale cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei. Mitosis is rare. Unlike Paget\u2019s disease of the breast, the underlying carcinoma is reported in only 20% due to adenocarcinoma of the Bartholin\u2019s gland. In the perianal region, it is associated with adenocarcinoma of the anus. It is important to search for the underlying malignancy which may be involved in 30% cases. Paget\u2019s disease of the vulva The treatment is local excision or vulvectomy  if  no  underlying lesion is detected. With underlying lesion, treatment is as of invasive cancer.

A retractor such as the Morris retractor is usually curved. The handle of the retractor is made in a manner to provide the surgeon with the utmost grip and for the instrument to be comfortable while being used. There are some Morris retractors which are double ended as well and hence can be used from either side.
