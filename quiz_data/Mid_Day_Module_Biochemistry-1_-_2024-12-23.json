Allosteric control with negative feedback is found in many metabolic pathways</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Allosteric control with negative feedback is indeed a key regulatory mechanism in many metabolic pathways, making option D correct. In negative feedback allosteric regulation, the end product of a metabolic pathway inhibits an enzyme at an earlier step in the pathway, effectively shutting down production when sufficient product has accumulated. Classic examples include:</li><li>\u2022 Inhibition of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) by ATP in glycolysis Inhibition of aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) by CTP in pyrimidine synthesis</li><li>\u2022 Inhibition of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) by ATP in glycolysis</li><li>\u2022 Inhibition of aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) by CTP in pyrimidine synthesis</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Allosteric effectors bind allosteric enzymes at their active sites : This statement is incorrect. By definition, allosteric effectors bind to sites distinct from the active site, called allosteric sites. The term \"allosteric\" comes from \"allo\" (other) and \"steric\" (space or structure), referring to binding at a site other than the active site. When an allosteric effector binds, it induces a conformational change that alters the activity of the enzyme.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Allosteric effectors bind allosteric enzymes at their active sites</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Allosteric enzymes possess secondary structure : This statement is correct but not distinctive. All proteins, including enzymes (allosteric or not), possess secondary structure elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets. This is not a unique characteristic of allosteric enzymes.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Allosteric enzymes possess secondary structure</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Allosteric control is irreversible : This is incorrect. Allosteric regulation is typically reversible, allowing for rapid adaptation to changing cellular conditions. When the concentration of the allosteric effector decreases, the enzyme can return to its original conformation and activity state.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Allosteric control is irreversible</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Allosteric enzymes are typically oligomeric proteins with multiple subunits that exhibit cooperativity and sigmoidal kinetics rather than the hyperbolic kinetics of Michaelis-Menten enzymes. Their activity can be modulated by effectors binding at sites distinct from the active site, causing conformational changes that alter the enzyme's catalytic efficiency. This provides a rapid, reversible mechanism for regulating metabolic pathways in response to changing cellular needs, with negative feedback being one of the most common control mechanisms in metabolism.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: DM Vasudevan 9/e: p 62.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: DM Vasudevan 9/e: p 62.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

After certain types of myocardial injury, such as an MI, cardiac cells release more LDH-1 than LDH-2, which can lead to LDH-1 becoming higher than LDH-2. This reversal is what's referred to as a \"flipped pattern,\" so the statement LDH-2 >>> LDH-1 being known as a flipped pattern is false.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 This question tests understanding of LDH isoenzyme patterns in normal and pathological states. The five LDH isoenzymes (LDH-1 through LDH-5) consist of different combinations of H (heart) and M (muscle) subunits. LDH-1 (H\u2084) predominates in heart tissue, LDH-5 (M\u2084) predominates in liver and skeletal muscle, and the others are hybrid forms. The normal serum pattern (LDH-2 > LDH-1) gets reversed in myocardial infarction, creating the \"flipped pattern\" (LDH-1 > LDH-2). While historically important, LDH isoenzyme analysis has been largely replaced by more specific cardiac markers such as troponin in modern clinical practice.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref : Harper 30/e: p 69.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
