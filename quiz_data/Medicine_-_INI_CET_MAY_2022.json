      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Obstructive etiology with response to bronchodilator FEV1/FVC is <0.7 and There is bronchodilator reversibility, since the FEV1 value increased to 12% after bronchodilator therapy. Thus we can say that the patient has obstructive etiology with response to bronchodilator leading to positive bronchodilator reversibility. FEV1 is the forced expiratory volume in one second or the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in one second, after full inspiration. FVC is the forced vital capacity or the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration and expiration. Both these values can be measured by spirometry .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Obstructive vs. Restrictive Lung Disease Obstructive Restrictive Characteristics Limitation of airflow due to partial or complete obstruction Reduced expansion of lung parenchyma accompanied by decreased total lung capacity Examples \u2022 Emphysema \u2022 Chronic bronchitis \u2022 Bronchiectasis \u2022 Asthma \u2022 Interstitial lung disease \u2022 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis \u2022 Pneumoconiosis \u2022 Sarcoidosis \u2022 Chest wall neuromuscular diseases Total lung capacity Normal Decreased Forced vital capacity (FVC) Normal Reduced Forced Expiratory Volume at 1 sec (FEV\u2081) Decreased Normal or reduced FEV1/FVC ratio <0.8 Normal</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option A - Restrictive etiology with response to bronchodilator Option B - Restrictive etiology with no response to bronchodilator Option D - Obstructive etiology with no response to bronchodilator. This is likely a case of asthma , and not in COPD.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The ratio between the FEV1 and FVC can help distinguish between restrictive and obstructive lung diseases. Restrictive lung diseases cause a decrease in lung volume . Obstructive lung diseases trap air in the lungs and therefore increase lung volume. Restrictive lung diseases can be caused by either poor breathing mechanics (a result of conditions like myasthenia gravis, obesity, and scoliosis ) or can result from interstitial lung disease such as pneumoconiosis or ARDS . Lung volume decreases in restrictive lung disease and the FEV1/FVC ratio is normal to increased (ie. greater than 80 %) due to a significant decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC). Obstructive lung disease is characterized by airway obstruction and it is associated with inflammation of the airways and problems exhaling. Types of obstructive lung disease include:- asthma, bronchiectasis and COPD (chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema). Obstructive lung disease results in air trapping in the lungs which expands the lung volume over time. A decrease in the FEV1/FVC ratio suggests an obstructive condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA ASTHMA COPD \u2022 More intermittent airflow obstruction \u2022 Improvement in airways obstruction with bronchodilators and steroids \u2022 Cellular inflammation with eosinophils, mast cells, T- lymphocytes, and neutrophils in more severe disease \u2022 Broad inflammatory mediator response \u2022 Airways remodeling \u2022 Progressively worsening airflow obstruction \u2022 Often presents in 6th decade of life or later in patients \u2022 More permanent airflow obstruction; less reversibility and less normalization of airflow obstruction \u2022 Cellular inflammation: neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils and mast cells may occur \u2022 Emphysema frequently found</p>\n<p></p>",

After delivery this patient has developed signs and symptoms of pituitary infarction such as palpitations, dizziness, hypotension refractory to resuscitation. Steroids should be used to effectively reverse this state. It occurs as a result of the necrosis of cells of the anterior pituitary gland following significant post-partum bleeding, hypovolemia , and shock . Hypopituitarism results in \u2193 prolactin secretion During pregnancy , increased circulating estrogen causes hyperplasia of lactotrophs in order to prepare for the increased hormonal demands during and following pregnancy. This increased size of the pituitary, however, is not associated with increased blood flow, which makes the pituitary gland especially susceptible to ischemia during low-volume states (e.g. prolonged or severe postpartum bleeding ). All pituitary hormonal deficiencies can occur, but the sudden onset of ACTH (and therefore, cortisol ) deficiency is the most serious because it can cause life-threatening hypotension.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Secretion of following is most affected- prolactin growth hormone cortisol secretion gonadotropin thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) Diagnosis History of postpartum hemorrhage , failure to lactate and secondary amenorrhea is the most important clue for diagnosis .

ACTH controls the production of another hormone called cortisol .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Dobutamine is a medication used in the treatment of cardiogenic shock and severe heart failure. It may also be used in certain types of cardiac stress tests. It is given by IV only, as an injection into a vein or intraosseous as a continuous infusion. GH stimulates production of IGF-1 and increases the concentration of glucose and free fatty acids . It is a type of mitogen which is specific only to the receptors on certain types of cells. GH is a 191-amino acid, single-chain polypeptide that is synthesized , stored and secreted by somatotropic cells within the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary gland . Cortisol is made by the adrenal glands, two small glands located above the kidneys.

It is followed by the appearance of the vesicles within 24 hours. A cluster of vesicles appears to form patches, which coalesce to form an irregular , band-like distribution along the course of involved dermatomes . Eruptions are unilateral and never cross the midline of the body. The vesicles become pustular , breakdown , and form crusts. Lesions may last for one to two weeks. Fever, malaise, anorexia, and headache occur for one or more days. Regional lymph nodes are involved in the early stage of the disease. When the ophthalmic ( 5th cranial ) nerve is affected , corneal anesthesia may occur, and the condition is known as Gasserian ganglionitis. Paralysis of the facial nerve and vesicles in the external auditory canal affects the 7th cranial nerve.
