      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Male gender The above x-ray shows developmental dysplasia . Female gender is a risk factor The risk factors for DDH are below: Females First born Faulty intrauterine position Familial</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Developmental Dysplasia of Hip (DDH) It is defined as the dislocation of hip occurring before or just after birth. It is less common in India than western countries due most of the mothers carrying the babies on side of their waist. In this position the hips of child are abducted which does not allow the hip to dislocate. Etiology: The proposed etiological factors are: Ligamentous laxity of Hip capsule: which is more in females due to presence of maternal relaxin, which relaxes the joints in fetus Prenatal positioning: Breech, Probably by making hip ligaments lax and predisposing for dislocation. Post natal positioning: When child is wrapped with Hip extended position People who carry their infants astride the hip or in a wrap that flexes and abduct the hips have lower incidence of DDH. Primary acetabular dysplasia: although controversial: It is believed that acetabulum is shallower at birth then during earlier fetal period. Full coverage doesn't occur till 3yrs of age. Racial predication: Black and Asian have low incidence of DDH.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A,B & D. are not the correct options.</p>\n<p></p>",

Hilgenreiner\u2019s line is a horizontal line through the tri-radiate cartilage. Perkin\u2019s line is perpendicular to Hilgenreiner\u2019s line. The image below shows the vertical Perkin\u2019s line and the horizontal Hilgenreiner\u2019s line . Normally the femoral head lies in the inner and lower quadrant formed by these lines. But in DDH the femoral head is in the upper and outer quadrant. Option: C. Shenton\u2019s line i s a smooth curve formed by the inferior border of the neck of the femur with superior margin of the obturator foramen. It is broken in DDH and fractured neck of femur. Option: D. Klein\u2019s line is aline along the superior aspect of the femoral neck which normally intersects the epiphysis. In slipped capital femoral epiphysis,klein\u2019s line does not intersect the epiphysis and passes superior to it.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Trethowan\u2019s sign The above scenario is suggestive of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). The radiograph shows the Trethowan\u2019s sign. The Klein line is a line drawn along the superior aspect of the femoral neck which normally intersects the epiphysis. In SCFE,klein\u2019s line does not intersect the epiphysis and passes superior to it. This is known as Trethowan\u2019s sign .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis/Epiphysiolysis This is wrong term as the epiphysis doesn't slip. During a period of rapid growth, due to weakening of upper femoral physis shearing stress from excessive body weight, there is upward & anterior movement of femoral neck on the capital epiphysis. So the epiphysis displaces primarily posteriorly relative to the femoral neck. Incidence male: female 3:2 Classification Acute SCFE: Prodromal symptom for 3 weeks or less presenting as sudden fracture like episode after minor trauma. It is usually a salter type I injury and AVN is a significant complication Chronic SCFE: it is the most frequent form, an adolescent patient presenting with vague groin pain upper andlower thigh pain and limp Acute on chronic SCFE: In this prodomal symptoms are more than 3 weeks with sudden exacerbation of pain. Aetiology The cause is unknown in vast majority of patients. Treatment Definitive Treatment: Stabilize the capital femoral epiphysis to the femoral neck to prevent further slipping. Definitive treatment alternatives for the management of SCFE include in situ internal fixation or pinning; bone graft epiphysiodesis; primary osteotomy through the apex or base of the femoral neck or intertrochanteric area, with or without fixation of the epiphysis to the femoral neck; and application of a spica castc Because the changes in the chronic form occurs so slowly it is impossible to manipulate the femoral head into a better position. So treatment consists fixing the slip in its current position & preventing progression This is done by inserting one or more screws or pins across the growth plate (pinning in Situ) Acute slips, if unstable may be gently reduced before fixation but it increases the chances of AVN. Bone remodeling may cause permanent external rotation deformity and apparent coxa vara Chondrolysis & AVN are possible complications</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B.
