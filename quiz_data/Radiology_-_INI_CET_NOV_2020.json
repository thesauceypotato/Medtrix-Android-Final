Schober's test is a physical examination used in physical medicine and rehabilitation and rheumatology to measure the ability of a patient to flex the lower back.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Procedure: While the patient is in a standing position the examiner makes a mark approximately at the level of L5 (fifth lumbar vertebra). Two points are marked: 5 cm below and 10 cm above this point (for a total of 15 cm distance). Then the patient is asked to touch his/her toes while keeping the knees straight. If the distance of the two points do not increase by at least 5 cm (with the total distance greater than 20 cm), then this is a sign of restriction in the lumbar flexion. This can be useful in examining a patient suspected of ankylosing spondylitis or any condition leading to restriction of lumbar flexion. Ochronosis is the bluish black discoloration of certain tissues, such as the ear cartilage and the ocular tissue, seen with alkaptonuria, a metabolic disorder. Additionally, ochronosis can occasionally occur from exposure to various substances such as phenol, trinitrophenol, resorcinol, mercury, picric acid, benzene, hydroquinone, and antimalarials. Alkaptonuria is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by deficiency of Homogentisic acid oxidase, the only enzyme capable of catabolizing Homogentisic acid (HGA). Alkaptonuria features a defect in the biochemical pathway by which phenylalanine and tyrosine are normally degraded into fumaric and acetoacetic acid. The genetic defect is autosomal recessive and is mapped to the HGO gene on arm 3q1, and 18 genetic missense mutations are known to cause Homogentisic acid oxidase aberrations. This deficiency results in accumulation and deposition of HGA in cartilage, causing the characteristic diffuse bluish black pigmentation. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) has demonstrated involvement in the pigmentation process of chondrocytes. These affected connective tissues become weak and brittle with time, leading to chronic inflammation, degeneration, and osteoarthritis. Nevertheless, many patients with this metabolic disorder are symptomless until ochronotic changes occur with bluish black pigmented patches in the sclera developing in patients aged 30-39 years. These ocular discolorations are located between the corneal margin and the inner canthus. The fourth decade often marks the onset of thickening and blue-black or gray-blue discoloration of the ear cartilage. Other body locations that frequently display the alteration in skin hue are the eyelids, the forehead, the cheeks, the axillae, the genital region, the nail beds, the buccal mucosa, the larynx, the tympanic eardrum, and the tendons (most easily demonstrated by the patient making a fist). Ochronotic arthropathy develops later with arthritic symptoms. Accumulation of this pigment in cardiac tissue can lead to an inflammatory reaction and progressive heart valve dysfunction, with aortic stenosis being the most common, but in rare cases aortic regurgitation may also be observed.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option A.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Upper GI endoscopy & manometry Given case history and findings point to the diagnosis of achalasia cardia. Dysphagia to both solids and liquids from the onset (occurs in 85\u201391% of patients) is the most common presenting feature of achalasia, as liquids require better neuromuscular co-ordination than solids for oesophageal emptying. Postures like raising the arms in an erect position increase the intraoesophagael pressure and propel food in the aperistaltic oesophagus, as the oesophagus is compressed between the spine and the manubrium sterni. Regurgitation of undigested food (occurs in 75\u201391% of patients) is the second most common presenting symptom. Food is regurgitated prior to reaching the stomach, unlike in gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) or gastric outlet obstruction. Retrosternal chest pain and heartburn can be seen in 40\u201360% of patients, which often leads to misdiagnosis as GERD and a delayed diagnosis of achalasia. Fermentation of undigested carbohydrate produces lactate and causes heartburn. Chest pain is least responsive to treatment compared to other symptoms but it can resolve spontaneously, unlike others. Weight loss can occur but it is not as substantial as in mechanical causes of dysphagia (e.g., oesophageal cancer or stricture). The Eckardt score is based on the degree of dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss, and is used to evaluate treatment efficacy in achalasia. Cough and fever caused by aspiration pneumonia (8\u201310%) can be one of the presenting symptoms of achalasia. Another rare but noteworthy symptom in achalasia is impaired belching caused by compression of the membranous trachea by a dilated oesophagus and inadequate relaxation of the upper oesophageal sphincter. Clinical examination is usually unremarkable. Few patients may have emaciation and oral ulcerations caused by regurgitation. Diminished breath sounds, dull percussion notes, and crepitations in areas of consolidation can be found in cases of aspiration pneumonia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>INVESTIGATIONS Upper GI endoscopy and timed barium oesophagogram are the initial investigations to rule out mechanical obstruction. High resolution manometry (HRM) is diagnostic and helps to classify achalasia. The principal differential diagnoses of achalasia are GERD, pseudo achalasia, other oesophageal motility disorders, and mechanical dysphagia, which can be differentiated based on the investigations above. Image 1: Diagnostic investigations and treatment modalities in achalasia. A) Endoscopy showing a dilated, tortuous oesophagus in a case of achalasia. B) Timed barium oesophagogram at 5 minutes in a case of achalasia cardia showing retention of barium in the oesophagus. C) High-resolution manometry picture of Type I achalasia. D) High-resolution manometry picture of Type II Achalasia. E) High-resolution manometry picture of Type III Achalasia. F) Pneumatic dilatation in achalasia by Rigiflex\u2122 balloon dilator (Microvasive, Milliford, Massachusetts, USA). G) Mucosal incision in peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). H) Submucosal tunneling in POEM. I) Circular myotomy in POEM. J) Closure of mucosal incision in POEM. Timed barium oesophagogram (TBE) is the imaging of choice in achalasia. HRM has higher sensitivity and reproducibility than conventional oesophageal manometry and hence has replaced it for diagnosis and classification of achalasia. Achalasia can be classified into three subtypes according to the Chicago classification version 3.0. Integrated relaxation pressure of more than an upper limit of normal with 100% failed peristalsis differentiates achalasia from other motility disorders (e.g., Jackhammer oesophagus or distal oesophageal spasm). In Type I AC, there is no oesophageal contractility or pressurization. It represents late-stage disease with a dilated, atonic oesophagus caused by minimal oesophageal smooth muscle contractility ( Image 1C). Type II AC is Characterised by panoesophageal pressurization (in >20% swallows) between the upper and lower oesophageal sphincter, caused by disorganized oesophageal neuromuscular activity, which is indicative of intact oesophageal contractility ( Image 1D). Thus, Type II AC represents the early stage of disease and is most responsive to pneumatic dilatation (PD). Type II achalasia is also the most common subtype. Type III AC is least common and least responsive to therapy, and is Characterised by premature contractions (distal latency <4.5 seconds in >20% swallows) and segmental pressurization of the distal oesophagus ( Image 1E).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Bronchiectasis Bronchiectasis: Bronchiectasis (plural: bronchiectases) is defined as an irreversible abnormal dilatation of the bronchial tree. It has a variety of underlying causes, with a common etiology of chronic inflammation. The classic clinical manifestations of bronchiectasis are cough and daily mucopurulent sputum production, often lasting months to years. Blood-streaked sputum or hemoptysis may result from airway damage associated with acute infection. Less specific symptoms include dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, wheezing, fever, weakness, and weight loss.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Bronchiectasis is a morphologic diagnosis. Thus, it may exist with relatively few symptoms. Although patients may report repetitive pulmonary infections that require antibiotics over several years, a single episode of a severe infection, often in childhood, may result in bronchiectasis. These include tuberculosis, pertussis, or severe bacterial pneumonia. Presently, CF (cystic fibrosis) is the most common cause of bronchiectasis in children and young adults. Chronic wet cough may also be an indicator of bronchiectasis. According to macroscopic morphology, three types have been described, which also represent a spectrum of severity : Cylindrical bronchiectasis Bronchi have a uniform caliber, do not taper and have parallel walls ( tram track sign and signet ring sign ) Commonest form Varicose bronchiectasis Relatively uncommon Beaded appearances where dilated bronchi have interspersed sites of relative narrowing Cystic bronchiectasis Severe form with cyst-like bronchi that extend to the pleural surface Air-fluid levels are commonly present Plain radiograph Chest x-rays are usually abnormal but are inadequate in the diagnosis or quantification of bronchiectasis. Tram-track opacities are seen in cylindrical bronchiectasis, and air-fluid levels may be seen in cystic bronchiectasis. Overall there appears to be an increase in bronchovascular markings, and bronchi seen end-on may appear as ring shadows. Pulmonary vasculature appears ill-defined, thought to represent Peri bronchovascular fibrosis. CT CT and HRCT especially excel at demonstrating the airways and is able to a greater or lesser degree to distinguish some of the various underlying causes. A number of features are helpful in diagnosing bronchiectasis: Bronchus visualized within 1 cm of the pleural surface Especially true of lung adjacent to costal pleura Most helpful sign for early cylindrical change Lack of tapering Increased Broncho arterial ratio Diameter of a bronchus should measure approximately 0.65-1.0 times that of the adjacent pulmonary artery branch Between 1 and 1.5 may be seen in normal individuals, especially those living at high altitude Greater than 1.5 indicates bronchiectasis</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Hydatid disease: Hydatidosis is a parasitic infestation of humans caused by Echinococcus granulosus . Dogs and some wild carnivores like foxes are definitive hosts, harbouring worms in their intestine. Eggs are passed in the faeces and eaten by the intermediate hosts, and larvae encyst in the liver, lungs, and other organs. COPD: Symptoms include breathing difficulty, cough, mucus (sputum) production and wheezing. It's typically caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most often from cigarette smoke. Findings indicating COPD include: An expanded chest (barrel chest). Wheezing during normal breathing. Taking longer to exhale fully. Decreased breath sounds or abnormal breath sounds such as crackles or wheezes. CYSTIC FIBROSIS: Median age at diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is 6-8 months; two thirds of patients are diagnosed by 1 year of age. The age at diagnosis varies widely, however, as do the clinical presentation, severity of symptoms, and rate of disease progression in the organs involved. Clinical manifestations vary with the patient's age at presentation. Neonates may present with meconium ileus or, rarely, with other features such as anasarca. Patients younger than 1 year may present with wheezing, coughing, and/or recurring respiratory infections and pneumonia. GI tract presentation in early infancy may be in the form of steatorrhea, failure to thrive, or both. Patients diagnosed later in childhood or in adulthood are more likely to have pancreatic sufficiency and often present with chronic cough and sputum production. Approximately 10% of patients with cystic fibrosis remain pancreatic sufficient; these patients tend to have a milder course.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Staging of sarcoidosis is as follows: Stage 0: Normal chest radiographic findings.
