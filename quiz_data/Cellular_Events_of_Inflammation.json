      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>CD11b/CD18 CD11b/CD18 (MAC-1) is macrophage integrin which helps in the binding of microbes to macrophages and is not opsonins . Phagocytosis involves sequential steps: Recognition and attachment of the particle to be ingested by the leukocyte Opsonization refers to the coating of an antigen to increase the efficiency of phagocytosis. Engulfment with subsequent formation of a phagocytic vacuole The killing of the microbe and degradation of the ingested material. The efficiency of phagocytosis is greatly enhanced when microbes are coated with opsonins for which the phagocytes express high-affinity receptors. The major opsonins are: IgM and Fc receptors of IgG C3b breakdown product of complement ( C3a, C 4b, C5b ) Mannose-binding lectin Fibrinogen C- Reactive Protein ( CRP )</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) Neutrophil extracellular traps are extracellular fibrillar networks that concentrate antimicrobial substances at sites of infection and trap microbes, helping to prevent their spread. They are produced by neutrophils in response to infectious pathogens ( mainly bacteria and fungi ) and inflammatory mediators (e.g., chemokines, cytokines [mainly interferons], complement proteins, and ROS ). The extracellular traps consist of a viscous meshwork of nuclear chromatin that binds and concentrates granule proteins such as antimicrobial peptides and enzymes. In this process, the nuclei of the neutrophils are lost, leading to the death of the cells .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. C3b complement protein. Opsonin . Option: B. IgG antibody. Opsonin . Option: C. Mannose-binding Lectin (MBL). Opsonin .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The nuclear chromatin in the NETs , which includes histones and associated DNA, has been postulated to be a source of nuclear antigens in systemic autoimmune diseases , particularly lupus , in which individuals react against their own DNA and nucleoproteins. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS). (A) Healthy neutrophils with nuclei stained red and cytoplasm stained green. (B) Release of nuclear material from neutrophils (note that two have lost their nuclei), forming extracellular traps. (C) Electron micrograph of bacteria (staphylococci) trapped in NETS.
