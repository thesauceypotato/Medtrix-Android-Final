      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pyridoxine In sideroblastic anemia, there is impaired ability of bone marrow to produce normal RBCs resulting in production of ringed sideroblasts There is excess iron accumulation in cells leading to cellular death and ultimately resulting in sideroblastic anemia. Some of the cases of sideroblastic anemia is due to vitamin B 6 (Pyridoxine) deficiency. As pyridoxine is a coenzyme for ALA synthase its deficiency may result in reduced protoporphyrin and heme synthesis resulting in sideroblastic anemia. So, a supplementation of pyridoxine may help alleviate this condition.</p>\n<p></p>",
