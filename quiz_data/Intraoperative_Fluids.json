Individuals with antigen A (group A) will have antibodies against antigen B and secondly the most serious hemolytic reactions are produced by ABO incompatibility.</p>\n<p></p>",

The main advantage of ABT is that there is no risk of disease transmission and transfusion-related reactions can be avoided. In Pre-donation, the patient's blood is taken before surgery {subject to the condition that hematocrit should not fall below 34% and hemoglobin below 11 gm%} and stored in blood bank.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The major disadvantage of pre-donation is that the incidence of mismatch transfusion reactions remains the same because the patient\u2019s blood is stored in the blood bank and the most common cause of mismatch transfusion reactions is clerical errors.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Other two techniques used for autologous blood transfusion are: Isovolumic hemodilution: Patient blood is taken in the operation theatre on the day of surgery just before induction of anesthesia (avoiding the risk of mismatch transfusion) and replaced with fluids to maintain the same volume (that\u2019s why called Isovolumic). Replacement of blood with fluid causes hemodilution. The advantage of hemodilution is that hemodilution by decreasing resistance to flow can increase the oxygen delivery of tissues. Blood salvage: A special device called a blood salvage machine collects a patient's lost blood during surgery, process it to remove tissues from it, and transfuses it back to the patient.</p>\n<p></p>",
