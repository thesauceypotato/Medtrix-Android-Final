This is an example of Anaphylaxis: a generalized immune reaction of the body in the individuals sensitive to the agent that causes the body to enter into anaphylactic shock and puts the individual's life at immediate risk. This can be caused by agents such as toxins in insect bites, vaccines, antibiotics (such as penicillin), and even some foods such as Peanuts.

Cardinal features are weakness and fatigue which deteriorate with repeated use and improve with sleep and rest. Exacerbations and remissions are common.

Anti-AChR radioimmunoassay: ~85% positive in generalized MG; Edrophonium chloride (2 mg + 8 mg IV): Edrophonium is a readily acting reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.

The sliding filament theory begins with the release of calcium ions from a specialized organelle in the muscle fiber called the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as described in the statement (3). Calcium ions bind to tropomyosin, causing it to pull away from and expose these myosin binding sites on the actin filament, as described in the statement (2). This allows the myosin heads to temporarily bind to the actin filament, forming cross-bridges, which are otherwise known as transverse links, between the molecules, as described in the statement (5). The formation of these cross-bridges releases the inorganic phosphate molecule from each myosin head. The myosin head then changes angle, pulling the whole actin filament along. This process is sometimes called a power stroke and is described in the statement (7). The power stroke releases the molecule of ADP from each myosin head. This is described in the statement (8). This allows ATP to bind to myosin instead, leading to the breaking of the cross-bridge between the actin and myosin filaments and causing the myosin heads to detach. This is described in the statement (6). The myosin heads are now positioned further along the actin filament than they were before the power stroke due to the actin filament being pulled along. The ATP molecule bound to the myosin head is hydrolyzed to produce ADP and inorganic phosphate. ATP hydrolysis requires an enzyme called ATPase, as described in the statement (4). The hydrolysis of ATP releases the energy needed for the myosin head to be ready for another power stroke and binds to another myosin binding site further along the actin filament. To prepare for this, the myosin head returned to its original position, as described in the statement (1).
