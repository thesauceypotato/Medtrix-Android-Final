      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Nonionic calcium is the most important stimulus for PTH secretion Circulating ionized calcium acts directly on the parathyroid glands in a negative feedback fashion to regulate the secretion of PTH .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The key to this regulation is a cell membrane receptor, CaR. Activation of this G-protein-coupled receptor leads to phosphoinositide turnover in many tissues. In the parathyroid, its activation inhibits PTH secretion. In this way, when the plasma level is high, PTH secretion is inhibited and the   is deposited in the bones. When it is low, secretion is increased and is mobilized from the bones.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Mg stimulates PTH secretion in the same way as Ca. Option: C. Excessive secretion of PTHrP is the most common cause of hypercalcemia of malignancy. It is also known as humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) and accounts for about 80% of the cases. Option: D. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) represents the molecular mechanism by which parathyroid cells detect changes in blood-ionized calcium concentration and modulate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion to maintain serum calcium levels within a narrow physiological range.</p>\n<p></p>",
