      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dix Hallpike Manoeuvre The above test shows Dix Hallpike Manoeuvre. This test is particularly useful when the patient complains of vertigo in certain head positions. It also helps to differentiate a peripheral from a central lesion.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Dix Hallpike Manoeuvre METHOD The patient sits on a couch. The examiner holds the patient\u2019s head, turns it 45\u00b0 to the right, and then places the patient in a supine position so that his head hangs 30\u00b0 below the horizontal. The patient\u2019s eyes are observed for nystagmus. The test is repeated with the head turned to the left and then again in a straight head-hanging position.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Epley Manoeuvre is used to treat BPPV. Epley's maneuver for BPPV of the posterior canal shows the position of the patient and the corresponding position of otolith debris in the posterior canal. (A) The patient sitting facing forward. (B) The patient lying down in the Dix-Hallpike position with head hanging and turned 45\u00b0 to the right (the affected ear). (C) Head turned to left Dix-Hallpike position with affected ear up. (D) The head and body both turned as a unit to the unaffected side so that the face is turned to the ground. (E) The patient is made to sit with their head bent forward by 20\". Option: C. Cottle\u2019s test is used in nasal obstruction due to abnormality of the nasal valve. In this test, the cheek is drawn laterally while the patient breathes quietly. If the nasal airway improves on the test side, the test is positive and indicates an abnormality of the vestibular component of the nasal valve. Option: D. A head impulse test is done to check VOR (Vestibulo Ocular Reflex).</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Labyrinthine Artery The labyrinthine artery accompanies the vestibulocochlear nerve and enters the internal auditory meatus to supply the internal ear . It is an end artery . It is the primary source of blood for the inner ear.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery arises at the lower border of pons, and passes laterally, supplying the sixth, seventh, and eighth cranial nerves. It then loops over the flocculus of the cerebellum and supplies an anteroinferior aspect of the cerebellum. Option: C. Superior cerebellar artery arises close to the superior border of the pons. It winds posteriorly along the superior border of pons and middle cerebellar peduncle, supplying both. It sends many branches to the superior surface of the cerebellum. The oculomotor nerve (III) passes between the superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries. B: Tentorium and middle fossa dura removed to expose trigeminal nerve (V) Option: D. Pontine branches of the basilar artery are numerous slender branches that pierce the pons both in the medial and lateral parts. As the basilar artery courses through the basilar sulcus on the ventral aspect of the pons, it travels adjacent to the abducens nerve at the lower pontine border and the oculomotor nerve as it ascends more cranially</p>\n<p></p>",
