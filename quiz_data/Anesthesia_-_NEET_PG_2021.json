      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>CPCR with 20% intralipid Given question describes the case scenario of bupivacaine toxicity. Cardiac toxicity associated with overdose of intravascular injection of local anesthetic is characterized by hypotension, atrioventricular conduction delay, idioventricular rhythms, and eventual cardiovascular collapse. Although all local anesthetics potentially shorten the myocardial refractory period, bupivacaine avidly blocks the cardiac sodium channels, thereby making it most likely to precipitate malignant arrhythmias. Even levobupivacaine and ropivacaine (single-enantiomer derivatives), developed to ameliorate cardiovascular side effects, still harbor the potential to disrupt cardiac function. Primary therapy remains adherence to proven guidelines\u2014cardiac and SpO2 monitoring, proper availability and dosing of all local anesthetics, immediate means to support ventilation, proper cardiac compressions during CPR, and application of proven advanced life support techniques. Only then should lipid rescue be considered in the therapeutic algorithm. The mechanism by which lipids reverse local anesthetic cardiotoxicity may be increasing clearance from cardiac tissue. This nonspecific, observed extraction of local anesthetics from aqueous plasma or cardiac tissues is termed a \u201clipid sink.\u201d Another proposed mechanism is that lipids counteract local anesthetic inhibition of myocardial fatty acid oxidation, thereby enabling energy production and reversing cardiac depression. Step to consider after \u201call standard resuscitation methods fail to re-establish sufficient circulatory stability\u201d would be as follows: 20% Intralipid: Administer 1.5 mL/kg as an initial bolus; the bolus can be repeated 1- 2 times for persistent asystole. Start an infusion at 0.25 mL/kg/min for 30-60 minutes; increase infusion rate up to 0.50 mL/kg/min for refractory hypotension</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Block Na+ Channels Local anaesthetics mainly acts by blocking sodium channels. Local anaesthetics may also bind and inhibit calcium, potassium, chloride channels and many other channels. But main action is on Sodium channels. The voltage gated sodium channels exists in 3 states : Resting Activated state and Inactivated state Sodium channels have one larger \u03b1 Subunit and one or two smaller \u03b2 subunits. The LA binds to \u03b1 subunit of sodium channels, thereby preventing their activation and inhibiting influx of sodium.</p>\n<p></p>",

Relative contraindications: Suspected or actual cervical spine injury Avoid closing mouth or compressing chin soft-tissue Obstructs airway Tilting the head or otherwise moving the neck is contraindicated in a patient with a possible cervical spine injury, but maintaining an airway and ventilation is a greater priority. In the setting of a possible cervical spine injury, the jaw-thrust maneuver, in which the neck is held in a neutral position, is preferred over the head tilt\u2013chin lift maneuver.</p>\n<p></p>",
