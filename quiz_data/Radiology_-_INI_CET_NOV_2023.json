      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Button battery Button batteries are small, circular, and can be easily ingested by children, especially if left within their reach. When lodged in the esophagus, they can cause significant issues due to their shape and electrical charge. X-ray imaging typically shows a button battery as a round object with a distinctive double-ring appearance due to the two layers of metal separated by a black center. This appearance is characteristic and helps identify it in the esophagus.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Esophageal foreign bodies are frequently encountered in clinical practice, representing the most common site for ingested foreign bodies or food impaction within the gastrointestinal tract. Epidemiology Children are more prone to oesophageal foreign bodies, often due to accidental ingestion of coins, batteries, toy parts, pins, needles, and various types of food In adults, foreign body ingestion can be accidental or intentional, usually occurring in patients with intellectual disability, psychiatric diseases, and drunkards. The most common cause of impaction in adults is meat, chicken and fish bones, and dentures Clinical presentation The symptoms of oesophageal foreign bodies include Retrosternal fullness Chest pain Hypersalivation Hiccups Gagging Choking Coughing Retching Dysphagia, and odynophagia Plain radiograph A chest x-ray may help identify the object and its location . Flat things like coins or disk batteries usually appear round on the frontal x-ray view . Bone and glass may be detectable; however, materials like food, plastic, wood, and aluminum may not be visible on x-rays</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B- Coins are a common foreign body ingestion in children. However, on X-ray, they usually present as a circular object with a single layer of metal, unlike the double-ring appearance of a button battery. Option: C- Metallic cap of a bottle: They generally do not have the specific double-ring appearance seen with button batteries on X-rays. They might appear as a solid circular object, unlike the distinct appearance of a button battery. Option: D- Rings are not uncommon to be accidentally swallowed by children, they don't resemble the characteristics seen on an X-ray for a button battery. Rings usually appear as a complete circle without the double-ring pattern of a button battery.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Following are the characteristic signs of button battery in esophagus -</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>SPECT Sestamibi SPECT Sestamibi- (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) Sestamibi scan is a highly sensitive and specific imaging technique used to localize parathyroid adenomas. It involves injecting a radioactive tracer (technetium-99m sestamibi) into the bloodstream, which is taken up by the overactive parathyroid gland. The SPECT imaging helps create detailed images of the distribution of this tracer, highlighting the location of the adenoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a three-dimensional nuclear medicine imaging technique combining the information gained from scintigraphy with that of computed tomography. This allows the distribution of the radionuclide to be displayed in a three-dimensional manner offering better detail, contrast and spatial information than planar nuclear imaging alone. Principle Gamma cameras rotate around the patient providing spatial information on the distribution of the radionuclide within tissues. The use of multiple gamma cameras increases detector efficiency and spatial resolution. The projection data obtained from the cameras are then reconstructed into three-dimensional images usually in axial slices 1-3. When SPECT-CT is used, attenuation correction and higher resolution anatomical localisation can be achieved Uses Tc-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion study Brain imaging (perfusion and receptor-binding radiotracers) Tc-99m sestamibi parathyroid scan White cell scan Bone scan</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B - This answer seems to be similar to the correct answer. Technetium-99m (Tc99m) sestamibi scan is indeed the imaging modality commonly used for localizing parathyroid adenomas. It provides detailed information about the location of the abnormal parathyroid gland by detecting the uptake of the radioactive tracer. Option: C- USG (Ultrasound) neck - While it can detect some adenomas, it might not be as sensitive or specific as sestamibi scans for identifying smaller or deeply located adenomas. Option: D - MRI is a powerful imaging tool but might not be the first choice for localizing parathyroid adenomas. While it can provide detailed images of soft tissues, it might not be as effective as sestamibi scans in identifying the specific functional activity of the parathyroid adenoma, which is crucial for localization.</p>\n<p></p>",
