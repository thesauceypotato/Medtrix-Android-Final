      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Serial values of Troponin T/I The laboratory evaluation of MI is based on measuring blood levels of macromolecules that leak out of injured myocardial cells through damaged cell membranes. These molecules include myoglobin, cardiac troponins T and I (TnT, TnI), creatine kinase (CK; specifically, the myocardial isoform, CK-MB), and lactate dehydrogenase. Troponins (and to a lesser extent CK-MB) have high specificity and sensitivity for myocardial damage. TnI and TnT normally are not found in the circulation; however, after acute MI, both are detectable within 2 to 4 hours, with levels peaking at 48 hours and remaining elevated for 7 to 10 days. Persistence of elevated troponin levels allows the diagnosis of an acute MI to be made long after CK-MB levels have returned to normal. With reperfusion, both troponin and CK-MB levels may peak earlier owing to a more rapid washout of the enzyme from the necrotic tissue. Option B. CK-MB has long been the biomarker of myocardial injury but is now tested less frequently in favor of the more sensitive cardiac-specific troponins. Total CK activity is not a reliable marker of cardiac injury since various isoforms of CK are found in non-cardiac tissues. However, the CK-MB isoform\u2014principally derived from the myocardium, but also present at low levels in skeletal muscle\u2014is a more specific indicator of heart damage. CK-MB activity begins to rise within 2 to 4 hours of MI, peaks at 24 to 48 hours, and returns to normal within approximately 72 hours</p>\n<p></p>",

The most common covalent modification is phosphorylation & dephosphorylation . Other covalent modifications are:- Adenylation Uridylation ADP Ribosylation Methylation Acetylation Proteolytic activation . In proteolytic activation, the inactive form of the enzyme (called a zymogen or proenzyme) is cleaved at one or several locations (peptide bonds) irreversibly and permanently, thereby transforming the enzyme into its active form.</p>\n<p></p>",
