      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Can be seen in immunosuppressed patient The image shows a fungal corneal ulcer with a dry and rough -looking ulcer, satellite nodules, and hypopyon. It can occur secondarily in patients who are immunocompromised .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>MYCOTIC CORNEAL ULCER Etiology: Fungi commonly responsible for mycotic corneal ulcers are Aspergillus fumigatus (most common), Candida, and Fusarium. Modes of infection : Injury by vegetative material such as a crop leaf, as a branch of a tree, a straw, a thorn, a wooden stick, or decaying vegetable matter. Common sufferers are field workers, especially during harvesting season. Injury by an animal\u2019s tail is another mode of infection. Secondary fungal ulcers are common in patients who are immunosuppressed systemically or locally, such as patients suffering from dry eye, herpetic keratitis , bullous keratopathy, or postoperative cases of keratoplasty. Role of antibiotics and steroids : Antibiotics disturb the symbiosis between bacteria and fungi, and steroids make the fungi facultative pathogens, which are otherwise symbiotic saprophytes. Therefore, excessive use of these drugs predisposes  patients to fungal infections. Clinical features Symptoms are less marked than in an equal-sized bacterial ulcers and the overall course is slow and torpid. Signs are more prominent than symptoms. A typical fungal corneal ulcer has the following salient: Corneal ulcers are greyish white, dry-looking, and have elevated, rolled out margins . Pigmented ulcers (brown) may be caused by some species of fungi, e.g., dematiaceous fungi . \u2022 Delicate, feathery finger-like extensions are present in to the surrounding stroma under the intact epithelium. Sterile immune rings (yellow line of demarcation) may be present where fungal antigen and hose antibodies meet. Multiple, small satellite lesions may be present around the ulcers. Hypopyon, usually a big one, is present even if the ulcer is very small. Unlike bacterial ulcers, the hypopyon is not sterile as the fungi can penetrate into the anterior  chamber without perforation . Perforation in mycotic ulcers is rare but can occur. Corneal vascularization is conspicuously absent in pure mycotic ulcers. Laboratory investigations Corneal scrapings : Examination of wet KOH mount preparation may reveal filamentous fungi as branched, septate hyphae (aspergillus fumigatus or fusarium) or nonfilamentous yeast like fungi (Candida). Gram and Giemsa stained films may reveal fungal hyphae and inflammatory cells. Culture on Sabouraud's agar medium should also be performed for fungi. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is also being recommended for its rapid results. Anterior chamber paracentesis may be carried out in cases with intraocular extension. Corneal biopsy is indicated in cases with deep stromal abscess or in cases where repeated cultures from scrapings are negative. Treatment Definitive treatment includes antifungal drugs: Topical antifungal eye drops should be used for a long period of time (6 to 8 weeks). i. For filamentous fungi (Aspergillus and Fusarium), Natamycin (5%) eye drops (drug of choice) or Amphotericin B (0.01 to 0.3%), or Fluconazole (0.2%), or Miconazole (10 mg/ml), or Voriconazole (10%) eye drops are to be instilled initially one hourly around the clock, then taper slowly over 6 to 8 weeks. For yeasts (Candida) amphotericin B (drug of choice ) or Nystatin (3.5%) eye ointment, five times a day is effective. Intracameral and intracorneal/intrastromal administration of voriconazole may be considered in cases with intraocular extension or anterior chamber involvement. Systemic antifungal drugs may be required for severe cases of deeper fungal keratitis. Tablets of fluconazole, ketoconazole or voriconazole may be given for 2-3 weeks. Adjunctive/ concurrent therapy . Non-specific treatment and general measures are similar to that of bacterial corneal ulce r Cycloplegic drugs. Preferably, l % atropine eye drops (ointment in small children) should be used: To reduce pain from ciliary spasm; and to prevent the formation of posterior synechiae from secondary iridocyclitis. Atropine also increases the blood supply to the anterior uvea by relieving pressure on the anterior ciliary arteries and so bringing more antibodies into the aqueous humour. It also reduces exudation by decreasing hyperaemia and vascular permeability. Another cycloplegic drug which can be used is 2% homatropine eye drops. Systemic analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs such as paracetamol and ibuprofen relieve the pain and decrease oedema. Vitamins (A, B-complex, and C) help in the early healing of ulcers. Therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty may be required for nonresponsive cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. A fungal corneal ulcer has a non sterile hypopyon. Option: B. Steroids are contraindicated in fungal corneal ulcers because they increase fungal replication and corneal invasion. Option: D. Signs are more prominent than symptoms in fungal corneal ulcers.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Recently recommended omics approaches, such as those using genomic, metagenomic, and tear proteomic data sources, seem to provide greater hope for better diagnosis and follow-up of fungal keratitis cases. A recent metagenomic approach is based on 16S rRNA genes to help monitor the dynamic change in conjunctival microbial flora associated with a fungal keratitis episode. Diagnostics based on 18S rRNA target enrichment sequencing can been used to diagnose fungal corneal infections using clinical samples. MDS allows for rapid diagnosis and is more effective for obtaining an accurate diagnosis without the need to wait for the fungus to grow. The custom tear proteomic approach is also evolving as an important modality in the diagnostics and management of mycotic keratitis. Rapid detection by multiplex PCR and antifungal susceptibility testing is being suggested as a routine management protocol of fungal keratitis to improve treatment outcomes.</p>\n<p></p>",
