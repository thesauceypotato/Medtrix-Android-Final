      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Forward displacement of the ciliary processes Anterior displacement of the ciliary processes pushes the peripheral iris forward, which subsequently narrows the anterior chamber and blocks the trabecular meshwork . This has been confirmed with anterior segment ultrasonography . Patients who have plateau iris syndrome (e.g., are resistant to laser peripheral iridotomy) should be treated with long-term miotics and possibly iridoplasty. Plateau iris is a type of narrow angle more commonly seen in younger adults that can lead to chronic angle closure glaucoma. Plateau iris refers to the anatomical configuration of the iris.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Plateau Iris Syndrome is a form of primary angle closure glaucoma caused by a large or anteriorly positioned ciliary body that leads to mechanical obstruction of the trabecular meshwork.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Plateau iris is caused by a narrowing of the anterior chamber angle due to insertion of the iris anteriorly on the ciliary body or displacement of the ciliary body anteriorly, which in turn alters the position of the peripheral iris in relation to the trabecular meshwork (i.e., placing them in apposition). Option: B. Plateau iris syndrome is defined as a persistently narrow angle capable of closure in spite of a patent iridotomy. Option: D. Plateau iris is an ocular condition that requires appropriate diagnosis and treatment in order to prevent vision loss. Early recognition and intervention are key components of a good overall prognosis in this patient population.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Plateau iris configuration is characterized by an appositional angle with a flat iris configuration, in contrast to an anterior bowing of the iris seen in a \u201ctypical\u201d angle closure glaucoma, in which there is a more crowded anterior chamber due to a hyperopic/short eye. Classically, with PIC, the iris configuration is planar and the depth of the anterior chamber is normal. In the images below, the anatomy of anterior chamber has been shown for both; the normal eye and an eye with a plateau iris, respectively. NORMAL ANATOMY:</p>\n<p></p>",
