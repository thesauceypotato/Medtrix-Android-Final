Phenytoin follows saturation kinetics, in which a constant quantity is eliminated per unit of time. A small increase in dose can result in a large increase in concentration and can result in toxicity. Therefore Phenytoin dosage should not be increased by more than 25- 30mg/day.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Sodium valproate causes Anorexia, vomiting, loose motions, and common but mild heartburn. Drowsiness, ataxia, and tremor occur at high doses. Option: C. Carbamazepine produces dose-related neurotoxicity\u2014sedation, dizziness, vertigo, diplopia, and ataxia. But does not cause gum hypertrophy. Option: D. Ethosuximide causes Dose-related side effects - gastrointestinal intolerance, tiredness, mood changes, agitation, headache, drowsiness, and inability to concentrate</p>\n<p></p>",

T-type calcium channels are thought to be responsible for the rhythmic 3-Hz discharge seen on EEG during absence seizures. Option: B. Inhibition of presynaptic voltage-activated Ca2+ channels is the mechanism of action of gabapentin. This drug is contraindicated in patients with childhood absence epilepsy because it can precipitate absence seizures. Gabapentin is often used to treat focal seizures. Option: C. Blockade of voltage-gated Na+ channels is the mechanism of action of lamotrigine. This drug is a third-line therapy for seizure prophylaxis in patients with childhood absence epilepsy; another drug is more appropriate as first-line therapy. Several other anticonvulsant drugs also act on Na+ channels, including valproic acid (a second-line therapy that increases channel inactivation), carbamazepine (which blocks the channels but is not used because it can precipitate absence seizures), and phenytoin (which blocks the channels but is ineffective in treating absence seizures). Option: D Inhibition of GABA reuptake into presynaptic neurons is the mechanism of action of tiagabine. This drug is contraindicated in patients with childhood absence epilepsy because it can precipitate absence seizures. Tiagabine is often used to treat focal seizures.</p>\n<p></p>",

Heartburn, hematemesis, and an esophageal ulcer after initiating treatment indicate drug-induced esophagitis. Option: B . This patient's drug-induced esophagitis is likely due to oral bisphosphonate therapy (e.g., risedronate). Bisphosphonates, which inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, are the first-line treatment for Paget\u2019s disease of the bone. Oral bisphosphonates may cause erosive esophagitis and esophageal cancer, especially in patients who do not maintain an upright posture for 30\u201360 minutes after ingestion. Other side effects of bisphosphonates (both IV and oral) include aseptic osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femoral fractures, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia.

Denosumab inhibits osteoclasts and reduces bone resorption. It is administered as a subcutaneous injection to treat osteoporosis. Denosumab is not currently recommended for use in Paget\u2019s disease of bone, and it is not associated with esophagitis.. Option: C. Calcitonin reduces bone resorption and disease activity in Paget\u2019s disease of bone. Because it is less effective than the first-line treatment, it is only used if the first-line therapy After initiating treatment, is poorly tolerated. Calcitonin is administered and does not cause esophagitis. Option: D. Oral prednisolone can cause drug-induced esophagitis, peptic ulcers, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. However, prednisolone should be avoided in patients with Paget\u2019s disease of bone because prolonged use may lead to osteoporosis and further increase the risk of fragility fractures.

The drug is reserved as an adjunct agent for patients with moderate to severe asthma whose symptoms are refractory to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and beta-2 agonists.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Omalizumab is used in treating moderate to severe allergic asthma that is refractory to treatment with inhaled steroids and long-acting \u03b22-agonists. Allergic asthma is caused by the binding of allergen-specific IgE to high-affinity receptors (FC\u025bRI) on basophils and mast cells. By binding circulating IgE, omalizumab reduces the serum levels of free IgE, which reduces the stimulation of mast cells and basophils and prevents activation of the inflammatory cascade. Over time, reduced serum IgE levels result in the downregulation of Fc\u03b5RI in these cells. Option: B. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist used as prophylaxis in asthma management. This drug inhibits the bronchospastic process initiated by proinflammatory leukotrienes by inhibiting leukotriene receptors, specifically in the bronchial smooth muscle cells. It cannot be used to reverse bronchospasm in an acute attack nor cause downregulation of the Fc\u03b5RI on mast cells and basophils. Option: C. Nedocromil is a mast cell stabilizer that inhibits degranulation, thereby preventing bronchospasm. It is used as a prophylactic medication for asthma but would not reverse bronchospasm in an acute attack. Furthermore, the drug has no effect on the Fc\u03b5RI on mast cells and basophils. Option: D. Infliximab is an anti-TNF antibody that is commonly used to treat Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. It is not indicated for the treatment of asthma, although there are small case series describing its use in this setting. Furthermore, infliximab does not cause downregulation of the Fc\u03b5RI on mast cells and basophils.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#Mantra</p>\n<p></p>",
