Vitamin C: Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, actually enhances iron absorption, especially non-heme iron (the form of iron found in plant-based foods). It does this by converting iron into a form that is more easily absorbed by the body.</li><li>\u2022 Vitamin C:</li><li>\u2022 b. Tea: Tea, especially black tea, contains compounds called tannins. Tannins can bind to iron, making it harder for the body to absorb. Therefore, drinking tea, especially with meals, can decrease the absorption of iron.</li><li>\u2022 Tea:</li><li>\u2022 c. Sprouts: Sprouts, like other plant-based foods, contain phytates (phytic acid), which can bind to minerals like iron and inhibit their absorption. However, the process of sprouting reduces the phytate content, which may actually improve the availability of iron.</li><li>\u2022 Sprouts:</li><li>\u2022 d. Gastric Acid: Gastric acid is crucial for iron absorption as it helps convert iron into its ferrous (Fe2+) form, which is more easily absorbed. Reduced gastric acid can lead to decreased iron absorption, as seen in conditions like atrophic gastritis or with the use of certain medications (like proton pump inhibitors).</li><li>\u2022 Gastric Acid:</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Vasomotor reversal of Dale : This phenomenon occurs when adrenaline is administered following the administration of alpha-blockers. In normal circumstances, adrenaline produces biphasic response; first increase in BP (due to stimulation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors) and then decrease in BP (due to unopposed beta-2 stimulation). However, when alpha receptors are blocked, the administration of adrenaline leads to a predominant action on the beta receptors, causing vasodilation and an decrease in blood pressure.</li><li>\u2022 Vasomotor reversal of Dale</li><li>\u2022 c.
