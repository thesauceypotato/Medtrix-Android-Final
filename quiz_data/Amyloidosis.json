Multiple myeloma (bone marrow aspirate). Normal marrow cells are largely replaced by plasma cells including forms with multiple nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and cytoplasmic droplets containing immunoglobulin. The pathogenesis of renal failure , which occurs in up to 50% of patients, is multifactorial . However, the single most important factor seems to be Bence Jones proteinuria , as the excreted light chains are toxic to renal tubular epithelial cells .
