The deviation in near vision is conveniently tested by the Maddox wing test, in which the patient looks through the two-slit holes in the eyepieces of the instrument. The fields which are exposed to each eye are separated by a diaphragm in such a way that they glide tangentially into each other. The right eye sees a white arrow pointing vertically upwards and a red arrow pointing horizontally to the left, whereas the left eye sees a horizontal row of figures in white and a vertical row in red. These are calibrated to be read in degrees of deviation. Both the arrow pointing to the horizontal row of figures and the arrow pointing to the vertical row should be at zero; any deviation indicates an eso- or exophoria or a hyperphoria, the amount of which can be read off on the scale.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>30PD The Hirschberg corneal reflex test gives you a rough estimation of the degree of deviation of the eye either in eso or exo. The normal corneal reflex is in the centre of the pupil or slightly nasal. The light reflex falling on the pupillary border means 15 degrees of deviation, at the limbus means 45 degrees of deviation and in between the two suggests 30 degrees of deviation on either side corresponding to esotropia and exotropia. One degree of deviation = 2 Prism Diopters . So the answer is approx 30PD. This test gives a rough estimate of deviation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>HIRSCHBERG CORNEAL REFLEX A rough indication of the angle of the squint can be obtained from the position of the corneal reflex when light is thrown into the eye from a distance of about 60 cm with the ophthalmoscope or a focused light beam from a torch. The patient is asked to look at the light; an infant does this reflexly. In the fixing eye, the corneal reflex will be in the centre of the pupil , slightly to the inner side if there is a large angle kappa and to the outer side if there is a negative angle kappa. The light is observed to be decentred in the squinting eye. If the reflex is about halfway between the centre of the pupil and the corneal margin, there is a deviation of about 20\u00b0 and if it is at the corneal margin, about 45\u00b0 . Roughly 1 mm deviation of the corneal light reflex is equivalent to 7\u00b0 of deviation . This test gives only an approximate estimation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A . 15PD - 30PD is not the correct answer.

The final lower pathway in the efferent tracts controlling ocular movements is undisturbed(e no paralysis and no restriction) , but either the visual impressions arriving at the cortex from one eye are defective or the fusional reflexes have not or have been weakly developed and have broken down so that an ocular deviation results. The cause or causes of this failure are unknown . Many contributory factors in the aetiology of comitant strabismus are: Defective vision in one eye , such as high ametropia, opacities in the media or ocular disease If the defect exists from birth or early life, the cortical cells normally subserving both eyes may never develop binocular connections. Disturbances in muscular equilibrium , usually due to a congenital mal-insertion or defective development of one or more of the extrinsic muscles , may act in the same way, with the squint perhaps being preceded by a period of heterophoria during which fusion was maintained. A change in the normal balance between accommodation and convergence The continuous effort of accommodation in the hypermetrope to see clearly, even in the distance, stimulates convergence to a greater degree than is compatible with binocular fixation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A - 1) Refractive error Option: B - 2) Anisometropia Option: C - 3) Prolonged use of wrong spectacles All these can cause comitant squint.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>AETIOLOGY OF INCOMITANT SQUINT: Congenital developmental abnormalities Trauma Infections Neoplastic Vascular (MOST COMMON CAUSE IS 6TH NERVE PALSY DUE TO VASCULAR CAUSE) Inflammatory disorders</p>\n<p></p>",
