It is not a Carbohydrate. It is a Poly phenolic compound, a polymer of Phenyl propane. Due to its non-polar nature it is not soluble in water. Inulin, amylose and chitin are homopolysaccharides made up of frutose, glucose and N-acetylglucosamine monomeric subunits respectively. Due to the presence of polar groups such as -OH, -COOH these are partly soluble in water.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>RNA editing In liver cell, Apo B 100 gene gives rise to Apo B 100 protein. But Apo B 48 protein is made in intestinal cells from the gene encoding Apo B 100, by the process of RNA editing, which is also known as Differential RNA processing or chemical modification of RNA. This is a post transcriptional modification. RNA splicing is also a post transcriptional modification but this is removal of introns and not editing. RNA interference is silencing technique where the gene is silenced by not letting the product of gene formed. Translocation occurs during translation. This is movement of ribosome over mRNA.</p>\n<p></p>",

So, amount of Adenine = Thymine, as they pair with each other by two hydrogen bonds. As adenosine given is 28 %, so total A+T is 56%. Now also, amount of Guanine = Cytosine, as they pair with each other by three hydrogen bonds. Remaining 44% equally distributed in 22% each for guanine and cytosine.</p>\n<p></p>",
