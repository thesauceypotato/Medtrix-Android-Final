      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The inflammatory phase of wound healing lasts for 5 to 7 days The inflammatory phase of wound healing lasts for 2 to 3 days. Normal wound healing occurs in three phases \u2013 the inflammatory phase lasts for the first 2 to 3 days, the proliferative phase lasts for 3 days to 3 weeks and, finally, the remodeling (maturation) phase lasts from the end of the third week to years.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Wound Healing: Inflammation : In the early inflammatory phase (days 1\u20132) , platelet activation causes an infux of inflammatory cells led by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, particularly neutrophils .

The inflammatory phase, also called the exudative phase has no tensile strength to the wound . It consists of vascular, cellular, and enzymatic processes. As a result of the wound, bleeding, vasoconstriction, and thrombus formation occurs. Platelets stick to the damaged vessel endothelium, releasing adenosine diphosphate (ADP), cytokines, serotonin, prostaglandins, and histamine. This causes vascular permeability, resulting in the migration of inflammatory cells and macrophages, the latter removing devitalized tissue and microorganisms. Fibrinogen produces fibrin, which forms the framework for fibroblastic activity, which is the second phase . Option C . The proliferative phase lasts from 3 days to the end of the third week. The principal feature of this is a fibroblastic activity with the production of collagen and new capillaries (angiogenesis) and re-epithelialization; this is called granulation tissue . This increased collagen gives the wound almost one-third of its original tensile strength . The third phase of remodeling constitutes re-arrangement and cross-linking of collagen fibers , which can go on for years while the wound regains 80% of its original tensile strength. Option D. Wound healing in special situations such as tendon consists of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, the latter depending upon fibrous adhesions between the tendon and its sheath</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>a, b, and e The aim should always be to achieve healing by primary intention. (Statement a) This can occur by reducing the inflammatory and proliferative responses. By doing so, healing occurs by first or primary intention when the wound edges are accurately opposed, leaving minimal scarring. ( Statement b) The mechanism of a wound has a profound bearing on the healing. For example, a clean-cut incision in an elective operation will heal well with the least prominent scar. On the other hand, a crush injury or one following burn will take a long time to heal and do so by secondary intention with ugly scarring. ( Statement e) In certain situations, such as emergency abdominal surgery in fecal peritonitis where the wound would be inevitably contaminated, it is prudent to leave the abdominal wall open after closing the peritoneum. Delayed closure of the wound is carried out when the inflammatory and proliferative phases of wound healing are well established. This is referred to as closure by tertiary or delayed primary intention.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Wound Healing: Stages Haemostasis Disruption of the vascular endothelium following injury causes vasoconstriction and exposure of the subendothelial extracellular matrix. This encourages platelets to adhere, activate and aggregate, resulting in a platelet plug, which also helps limit further blood loss. (A)Inflammation : In the early inflammatory phase (days 1\u20132) , platelet activation causes an influx of inflammatory cells led by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, particularly neutrophils . During the late inflammatory phase (days 2\u20133) monocytes appear in the wound and differentiate into macrophages (B)Proliferation : The proliferative phase starts around day 3 and lasts for 2\u20134 weeks . It consists mainly of fibroblast activity with the production of ground substance (glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans), collagen, angiogenesis, and re-epithelialization of the wound . The wound tissue formed in the early part of this phase is called granulation tissue . In the later part of this phase, there is an increase in the tensile strength of the wound as a result of increased collagen synthesized by fibroblasts . These play an important role in contraction to bring the edges of the wound together (C) Remodelling : Begins 2\u20133 weeks after injury and lasts for a year or more . This phase is characterized by maturation of collagen . Type III collagen, which is prevalent during proliferation, is replaced by stronger type I collagen until the normal skin ratio of 4:1 type I to type III collagen is re-established</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Statement C. is incorrect because: There is a role for testing hepatitis and HIV viruses when multiple victims from the same site (terrorist-related injuries or bus crashes) have been brought in because these will carry the risk of tissue and viral contamination. Statement D. is incorrect because: Primary repair of structures such as bone, tendon, soft tissue, nerve and vessels should not be attempted in all wounds. Such repair should be carried out only in a tidy wound. Staged procedures should be attempted in untidy wounds such as explosions.</p>\n<p></p>",

Skin incisions are best made along Langers\u2019 lines (tension lines), which represent the direction of dermal collagen fibers. Therefore, incisions made parallel to these lines result in a good scar, the surgeon\u2019s signature, which is the only part of the operation the patient actually sees. Option B, D. They should avoid bony prominences and skin creases and should take into account the final cosmetic result. The latter factor should not however be of paramount importance, as any incision should provide adequate access to make the operation safe and functionally effective. Transverse abdominal incisions cut through fewer dermatomes and hence produce less postoperative pain. Therefore, the patient coughs much better producing less respiratory complications.</p>\n<p></p>",

In the closure of the abdominal wall, the mass closure technique is the usual method. In this large bites are taken in short steps using nylon or polypropylene (non-absorbable) or polydioxanone (PDS, slowly absorbable) sutures. The length of suture material used should be at least four times the length of the incision to be closed; this is to minimize the risk of wound dehiscence or incisional hernia. Option B. Knot tying, one of the most basic of surgical techniques, should be thoroughly mastered as sutures lose 50% of their strength at the knot. Option D. Suture materials are generally classified as synthetic (non-absorbable) and natural (absorbable). Synthetic suture materials produce minimal tissue reaction. Sutures from biological or natural material elicit tissue reactions and hence are unpredictable in their behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>When using absorbable material , always be mindful that c ertain tissues require wound support for longer than others ; for example, muscular aponeuroses compared with subcutaneous tissues Biliary anastomoses require an absorbable material that will not promote tissue reaction or stone formation.

Conventional bowel preparation provides little benefit and may be harmful. However, meticulous prevention of spillage of bowel contents must be followed.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A: The currently favored technique of bowel anastomosis is one-layer extramucosal closure because it causes the least tissue necrosis and luminal narrowing. The suture must include the submucosa, which, by virtue of its high collagen content, is the most stable suture layer. Several studies have shown that there are very little differences between the single-layer and two-layer anastomosis as long as the basic surgical principles are followed, which include ensuring a good blood supply, tension-free anastomosis and use of atraumatic bowel clamps to minimize contamination. Option C: In end-to-end anastomosis, the bowel ends must be of similar diameter. Following resection for intestinal obstruction when the bowel ends to be anastomosed are unequal, a side-to-side or end-to-side anastomosis is done. In case the discrepancy is minimal, end-to-end anastomosis can be carried out by making a cut into the antimesenteric border (Cheatle split) of the distal collapsed lumen to bring the diameter into line with that of the proximal bowel. Option D: In vascular anastomosis when prosthetic material or graft is used, the anastomosis will never be integrated into the graft tissues. Therefore, the suture line needs to be permanent. Hence, polypropylene, as it is not biodegradable, is the ideal suture to be used.</p>\n<p></p>",

Protagonists believe that drains remove collections within a wound or peritoneal cavity and might indicate postoperative hemorrhage; those not in favor of drains claim that they increase the incidence of wound infections, abdominal pain, and hospital stays and that they reduce pulmonary function. Option C: Following a thoracotomy, drains are always inserted to remove air and blood; they are connected to an underwater seal to which sometimes a suction pressure of 10 to 20 mm Hg is applied. When removing a chest drain, the patient is always asked to take a deep breath and hold it (Valsalva maneuver) to prevent air from being sucked into the pleural cavity during the removal of the tube. Option D: After exploration of the common bile duct most surgeons insert a T-tube to remain in place for 10 days . This is to allow free postoperative bile drainage whilst there is spasm at the sphincter of Oddi ; additionally, when a postoperative T-tube cholangiogram is done after 10 days, it helps to show up any residual stones that might have been left inadvertently. T-tubes are left for 10 days to prevent intraperitoneal bile leakage after removal.</p>\n<p></p>",

Types In Monopolar surgery , the electrical current created in the ESU passes through a single electrode (diathermy pencil) to the tissue, causing the desired tissue effect (cut or coagulation). Electrical energy is passed via the diathermy probe and returned to the machine via the patient earth plate. Earth plate must be far away from pacemaker. It must not be used in circumcision and surgeries near the nerve. In Bipolar diathermy , the two active electrodes are usually represented by the limbs of a pair of diathermy forceps, blades of scissors, or graspers. It needs no Earth Plate. The current is between the limbs of the diathermy probe. Can be safely used in pacemakers. Safe in surgeries near nerve and Circumcision . Effects of Diathermy : Coagulation: to achieve hemostasis; Cutting: incision and dissection of tissues during surgery Hazards of Diathermy : Accidental Burns (More with Monopolar Diathermy) Electrocution Explosion Channelling Interference with implantable electronic devices Occupational hazards from surgical smoke Laparoscopic surgery and diathermy injuries</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A: There are two types of diathermy, monopolar and bipolar. The principle is used to coagulate, cut and fulgurate. The most common type is monopolar diathermy where normal electric current is converted into high-frequency alternating current (HFAC). In this, HFAC is passed through the patient\u2019s body tissues and returned to the machine by a large surface plate (70 cm2) called the indifferent electrode. The surface area of contact of the active electrode is small compared with the indifferent electrode; this concentrated powerful current produces heat at the operation site, thus exercising the desired effect. Option C: In bipolar diathermy , the HFAC passes from the diathermy machine down one prong of the forceps through to the tissue being held and returned to the machine via the second prong thus concentrating the desired effect on the small piece of tissue held by the forceps. Therefore , bipolar diathermy is ideal for patients who have a pacemaker because the current does not flow through other tissues of the body. Option D: Accidental burns are more common in monopolar diathermy for the following reasons : the indifferent electrode may be incorrectly applied with inadequate contact, the patient being earthed by metal contact on the operating table, there may be faulty insulation of the diathermy leads and accidental contact of the active electrode may occur with other metal instruments in use.</p>\n<p></p>",

Timing of initial reexploration can usually be achieved within 24 to 72 hours. Fluids should be restricted with attempts at diuresis if indicated, and infections strictly controlled. Definitive closure should only be attempted when the underlying condition is resolving During the Stage 3 or 4, it is important to assess the ability to close the fascia without undue tension due to tissue edema or loss of domain. This can be assessed by measuring intra-abdominal pressure and/or changes in peak inspiratory pressure during the closure Early enteral nutrition in the patient with an open abdomen should be strongly considered in all patients with a viable gastrointestinal tract</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>None of the above In Monopolar surgery , the electrical current created in the ESU passes through a single electrode (diathermy pencil) to the tissue, causing the desired tissue effect (cut or coagulation). Electrical energy is passed via the diathermy probe and returned to the machine via the patient earth plate. The Earth plate must be far away from the pacemaker. It must not be used in circumcision and surgeries near the nerve. In Bipolar diathermy , the two active electrodes are usually represented by the limbs of a pair of diathermy forceps, blades of scissors, or graspers. It needs no Earth Plate. The current is between the limbs of the diathermy probe. Can be safely used in pacemakers. Safe in surgeries near nerves and Circumcision . Effects of Diathermy : Coagulation: to achieve hemostasis; Cutting: incision and dissection of tissues during surgery Hazards of Diathermy : Burns Electrocution Explosion Channeling Interference with implantable electronic devices Occupational hazards from surgical smoke</p>\n<p></p>",
