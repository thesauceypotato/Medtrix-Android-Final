His vitals were checked and the blood pressure was 145/91mmHg, saturation was 95% and PR 87bpm. He has a history of smoking one packet daily for the last 30 years. No known previous history of hospitalization and diseases. Physical examination reveals that he got a pitting edema on his right leg extending upto the knee. His peripheral pulses all were symmetrical and full. He was admitted in the hospital and he was started with medications for prolonging activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time in a dose dependent manner. But this caused no any effect in thrombin time. Which of the following agent would have been given to the patient for relief?",

RCT > Prospective cohort > Retrospective cohort > Case-control > Cross-sectional</li><li>\u21b3 Here's an explanation of why this order is commonly used for establishing causality:</li><li>\u21b3 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs): RCTs are often considered the gold standard for establishing causality because they involve random assignment of participants to treatment and control groups, which helps control for confounding variables. By randomly allocating exposures or interventions, RCTs can demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship. Prospective Cohort Studies: In prospective cohort studies, individuals are followed over time, and their exposure to risk factors is measured before the development of the outcome. This design allows for the assessment of temporality, which is a key criterion for causality. Retrospective Cohort Studies: Retrospective cohort studies also examine the relationship between exposures and outcomes, but they use historical data. While they are informative, they may be more prone to biases than prospective cohort studies because the exposure information is collected after the outcome has occurred. Case-Control Studies: Case-control studies are retrospective in nature and compare individuals with the disease (cases) to those without the disease (controls) in terms of past exposures. They are useful for studying rare diseases or outcomes but are less robust for establishing causality compared to cohort studies. Cross-Sectional Studies: Cross-sectional studies assess the prevalence of exposure and outcome at a single point in time. While they can provide valuable insights and generate hypotheses, they are generally less suited for establishing causality due to their inability to establish temporality and the potential for reverse causation. Option 2 reflects this general hierarchy of study designs for assessing causality in epidemiology, with RCTs being the most robust method followed by prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional studies.</li><li>\u21b3 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs): RCTs are often considered the gold standard for establishing causality because they involve random assignment of participants to treatment and control groups, which helps control for confounding variables.
