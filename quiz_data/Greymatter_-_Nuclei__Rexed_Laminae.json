The efferent autonomic nerve fibres, which originate in the lateral horn of the spinal nerve, travel out of the spinal cord through the ventral root of the spinal nerve. As the ventral and dorsal roots join to form the spinal nerve, the fibres from both roots intermingle, and the dorsal and ventral primary rami take a mix of fibres, including afferent sensory fibres from the dorsal root, and efferent motor fibres from the ventral root. Postganglionic Sympathetic efferent fibres join each spinal nerve via a gray ramus Communicans. Efferent Pathways of the Autonomic Nervous System The efferent pathways of the ANS consist of 2 neurons that transmit impulses from the CNS to the effector tissue. The preganglionic neuron originates in the CNS with its cell body in the lateral horn of the grey matter of the spinal cord or the brainstem. The axon of this neuron travels to an autonomic ganglion located outside the CNS, where it synapses with a postganglionic neuron.
