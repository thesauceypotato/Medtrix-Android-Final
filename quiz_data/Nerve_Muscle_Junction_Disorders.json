At high doses , cyclophosphamide eliminates mature lymphocytes but spares hematopoietic precursors ( stem cells) , because they express the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, which hydrolyses</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>It is important to develop a treatment plan based on short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term objectives for Myasthenia gravis. For example, Short term- if immediate improvement is essential either because of the severity of weakness or because of the patient\u2019s need to return to activity as soon as possible, IVIg should be administered or plasmapheresis should be undertaken. Intermediate term - glucocorticoids and cyclosporine or tacrolimus generally produce clinical improvement within a period of 1\u20133 months. Long term- The beneficial effects of azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil usually begin after many months (as long as a year), but these drugs have advantages for the long-term treatment of patients with Myasthenia gravis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Mycophenolate mofetil is widely used because of its presumed effectiveness and relative lack of side effects. Its mechanism of action involves inhibition of purine synthesis by the de novo pathway , but lacking the alternative salvage pathway that is present in all other cells, mycophenolate inhibits the proliferation of lymphocytes but not the proliferation of other cells. Option:B. Azathioprine has long been used for Myasthenia gravis and a RCT demonstrated that it was effective in reducing the dosage of prednisone necessary to control symptoms. Option:D. Tacrolimus- The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and Tacrolimus seem to be effective in Myasthenia gravis and appear to work more rapidly than azathioprine and mycophenolate.</p>\n<p></p>",

Edrophonium is used most commonly for diagnostic testing because of the rapid onset (30 s) and short duration (~5 min) of its effect. An objective endpoint must be selected to evaluate the effect of edrophonium, such as weakness of EOMs , impairment of speech, or the length of time that the patient can maintain the arms forward. An initial IV dose of 2 mg of edrophonium is given. If definite improvement occurs, the test is considered positive and is terminated. If there is no change, the patient is given an additional 8 mg IV. The dose is administered in two parts because some patients react to edrophonium with side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, salivation, fasciculations, and rarely with severe symptoms of syncope or bradycardia. Atropine (0.6 mg) should be drawn up in a syringe and ready for IV administration if these symptoms become troublesome . The edrophonium test is now reserved for patients with clinical findings that are suggestive of Myasthenia gravis but who have negative antibodies, Electrodiagnostic testing, or ice-pack test .
