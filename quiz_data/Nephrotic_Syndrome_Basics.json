      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hematuria Hematuria is not a feature of nephrotic syndrome . It is typically seen in glomerular diseases that involve inflammation or damage to the glomerular capillaries, such as IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. However, it is not a common feature of nephrotic syndrome, which is primarily characterized by proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Nephrotic syndrome It is caused by a derangement in glomerular capillary walls resulting in increased permeability to plasma proteins. The manifestations of the syndrome include: Massive proteinuria, with the daily loss of 3.5 gm or more of protein (less in children) Hypoalbuminemia , with plasma albumin levels less than 3 gm/dL Generalized edema Hyperlipidemia and lipiduria Associated with the hypercoagulable state due to antithrombin III loss in urine Increased risk of infection</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Proteinuria: This is a hallmark feature of nephrotic syndrome, with proteinuria typically exceeding 3.5 grams per day. Option: B. Hypoalbuminemia: This is a common feature of nephrotic syndrome, with serum albumin levels typically falling below 3.0 grams per deciliter. Option: C. Hyperlipidemia: This is another hallmark feature of nephrotic syndrome, with elevated levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and other lipids in the blood. This occurs as a compensatory mechanism to replace the lost proteins, particularly albumin, which binds to and transports lipids.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Nephrotic syndrome Vs Nephritic syndrome Characteristics Nephrotic syndrome Nephritic syndrome Pathophysiology Damage to the foot process of podocyte Disruption of glomerular basement membrane due to inflammation Urine protein >3.5g/day <3.5g/day Hematuria Mild or absent Present Hypertension Mild or absent Often present Edema Present Often absent Serum Albumin <3.0g/dL Normal or decreased Serum creatinine Normal or decreased Increase Serum sodium Normal or decreased Normal or decreased Urine Sediment Few cells, fatty casts or none Red blood cell casts, cellular debris</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Casts in urine Cast type Appearance Associated conditions Hyaline Colo u rless, transparent, homogenous Normal finding, non-specific Red blood cell Red or reddish-brown,\n  cylindrical Glomerulonephritis,\n  vasculitis, hypertension, neoplasia, anticoagulant therapy White blood cell Variable shape, with granules\n  or nuclei visible Pyelonephritis, interstitial\n  nephritis, glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis Granular Coarse or fine, muddy brown in\n  appearance Acute tubular necrosis Fatty Round or oval, refractile,\n  yellow-brown, with a clear halo Nephrotic syndrome, diabetic\n  nephropathy, nephrotoxic drugs Waxy Broad, colourless, homogenous,\n  refractile End-stage renal disease Epithelial Squamous cells from the urethra or bladder may have internal debris Nonspecific, may be seen in a\n  variety of conditions</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Loss of antithrombin III The hypercoagulable state in nephrotic syndrome is primarily due to the loss of antithrombin III.

Decreased fibrinogen: Fibrinogen is a plasma protein that is involved in the formation of blood clots. Decreased fibrinogen levels would actually decrease the tendency towards clot formation. Option: C. Decreased metabolism of Vitamins K: Vitamin K is necessary for the production of several coagulation factors, including factors II, VII, IX, and X. However, decreased metabolism of vitamin K would not explain the hypercoagulable state seen in nephrotic syndrome. Option: D. Increase in protein C: Protein C is an anticoagulant protein that, when activated, inactivates coagulation factors V and VIII.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Nephrotic syndrome Vs Nephritic syndrome Characteristics Nephrotic syndrome Nephritic syndrome Pathophysiology Damage to the foot process of podocyte Disruption of glomerular basement membrane due to inflammation Urine protein >3.5g/day <3.5g/day Hematuria Mild or absent Present Hypertension Mild or absent Often present Edema Present Often absent Serum Albumin <3.0g/dL Normal or decreased Serum creatinine Normal or decreased Increase Serum sodium Normal or decreased Normal or decreased Urine Sediment Few cells, fatty casts or none Red blood cell casts, cellular debris</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Casts in urine Cast type Appearance Associated conditions Hyaline Colo u rless, transparent, homogenous Normal finding, non-specific Red blood cell Red or reddish-brown, cylindrical Glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, hypertension, neoplasia, anticoagulant therapy White blood cell Variable shape, with granules or nuclei visible Pyelonephritis, interstitial nephritis, glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis Granular Coarse or fine, muddy brown in appearance Acute tubular necrosis Fatty Round or oval, refractile, yellow-brown, with a clear halo Nephrotic syndrome, diabetic nephropathy, nephrotoxic drugs Waxy Broad, colourless, homogenous, refractile End-stage renal disease Epithelial Squamous cells from the urethra or bladder may have internal debris Nonspecific, may be seen in a variety of conditions</p>\n<p></p>",
