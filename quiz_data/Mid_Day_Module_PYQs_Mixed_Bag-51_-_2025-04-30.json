These clinical features are suggestive of advanced cervical cancer. The involvement of the lateral parametrium indicates that the cancer has spread beyond the cervix to the surrounding tissues but not to the pelvic wall or the lower third of the vagina, which classifies it as Stage 2B cervical cancer. The standard treatment for Stage 2B cervical cancer is chemoradiation, which combines chemotherapy with radiation therapy. This approach aims to enhance the effectiveness of the treatment, reduce tumor size, and prevent further spread of the cancer.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy alone is not the standard treatment for Stage 2B cervical cancer. It may be used in conjunction with radiation, but not as a sole therapy in this stage.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Chemotherapy:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Brachytherapy: Brachytherapy, a form of internal radiation therapy, is typically used for early-stage cervical cancer or in combination with external beam radiation therapy for more advanced stages. However, it is not sufficient as a standalone treatment for Stage 2B.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Brachytherapy:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Surgery: Surgery is generally not recommended for Stage 2B cervical cancer due to the extent of the disease spread to the parametrium.
