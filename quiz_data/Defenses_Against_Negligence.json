A registered medical practitioner can examine such a person, even using reasonable force, if the examination is requested by a police officer, not below the rank of sub-inspector (or any other officer acting under his direction and in good faith).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option B: 54, Cr.P.C. An arrested person, at his request, may be examined by a doctor to detect evidence in his favour. A copy of the report of such examination is to be furnished by the medical practitioner to the arrested person or the person nominated by the such arrested person. Option C & D: CrPC 174and CrPC 176 Are not related to the medical examination of the accused. Hence those three options are not the correct answers.</p>\n<p></p>",

Full disclosure of remote or theoretical risks could result in frightening a patient who is already fearful or emotionally disturbed and who may refuse the treatment when there is minimal risk. It is only in the case of frank psychosis or extreme psycho-neurosis that the patient will be incapable of accepting the information. In these cases, the doctor may use discretion regarding the facts he discloses. The doctor should carefully note his decision in the patient's record, explaining his intentions and the reasons. He should request a consultation to establish that the patient is emotionally disturbed. The presence of a malignancy or an unavoidable fatal lesion may not be disclosed if the doctor feels the patient cannot tolerate the knowledge. If possible, the physician should explain the risks to the patient's spouse or next of kin.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option A: PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION: It is a statement made bonafide upon any subject matter by a doctor to the concerned authority due to his duty to protect the interests of the community or the State Option B: PROFESSIONAL SECRECY (confidentiality): It is an implied contract term between the doctor and his patient. The relationship between doctor and patient requires utmost trust, confidence, fidelity and honesty. The doctor is obliged to keep secret all that he comes to know concerning the patient during his professional work. Option C: Res judicata (S. 300, Cr.P.C.).

The patient will not be allowed to contest the same question in another proceeding between himself and the doctor on the same set of facts. Only appeal can be made.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Exhibited gross lack of competency/skill This question wants to explore your understanding of what constitutes criminal negligence. Professional negligence (aka medical negligence) is divided into civil and criminal. By definition, criminal negligence may arise: When a doctor shows a gross absence of skill or care during treatment resulting in serious injury to or death of the patient; When a doctor performs an illegal act; When an assaulted person dies, the defence may attribute the death to negligence or undue interference in the treatment of the deceased by the doctor. In this case, as you can see, the doctor was drunk, and, at the time of the operation, there was a lack of skill, because of which the woman died. Hence it is the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Treated operation upon a pregnant woman- This does not constitute criminal negligence as the doctor must treat eclampsia however he seems appropriate. Option: C. Is guilty of contributory negligence- The doctrine of contributory negligence comes into play in civil negligence and not criminal negligence. Option: D. Violated code of medical ethics - He violated the code of medical ethics, and the state Medical council might give him punishment as disciplinary action against the doctor.</p>\n<p></p>",

Second, the patient failed to report to the hospital despite the doctor's warning. Contributory negligence is any unreasonable conduct or absence of ordinary care on the part of the patient, or his attendant, which, combined with the doctor's negligence, contributed to the injury complained of as a direct, proximate cause and without which the injury would not have occurred.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option A- Medical maloccurence- In some cases, despite good medical attention and care, an individual fails to respond properly or may suffer from adverse reactions to the drug. This is called medical mal occurrence. The injured person could not get monetary compensation for every mishap or accident which results in injury if the doctor was careful in the selection of \u00b7the drug and has taken appropriate measures to overcome the undesirable foreseeable effects. Option B- Therapeutic misadventure can be defined as an injury or an adverse event caused by medical management rather than by an underlying disease. Option C- Novus actus interveniens- Sometimes, such a continuity of events is broken by an entirely new and unexpected happening due to some other person's negligence. If the doctor is negligent, which results in a deviation from the original sequence of events. then the responsibility for the subsequent disability or death may pass from the original incident to the latter negligent action by the principle of \"novus actus interveniens\" (an unrelated action intervening).</p>\n<p></p>",
