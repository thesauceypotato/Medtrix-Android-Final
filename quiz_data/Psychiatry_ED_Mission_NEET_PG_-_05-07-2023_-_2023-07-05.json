SSRIs can cause syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), leading to hyponatremia, and thiazide diuretics can also cause hyponatremia by increasing sodium loss in the urine. Therefore, in this context, hyponatremia is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia can also cause confusion, but they are less likely in this case based on the patient's medication history. Serotonin syndrome typically presents with symptoms such as agitation, restlessness, and autonomic instability, which are not reported in this case.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Primary gain in Conversion Disorder refers to the internal psychological advantage obtained by the symptoms, such as relief from anxiety or conflict.

'La belle indifference' refers to an indifferent or unconcerned attitude towards serious symptoms or disabilities, a feature that can often be seen in Conversion Disorder. In this case, the woman's lack of concern about her paralysis could be indicative of this.</li><li>\u2022 D. In Conversion Disorder, the patient does not intentionally produce or feign the symptoms.
