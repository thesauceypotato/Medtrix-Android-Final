      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Superior parathyroid may be found anywhere along the line of descent The thyroglossal duct develops from the median bud of the pharynx. The foramen caecum at the junction of the anterior 2/3rd and posterior 1/3rd of the tongue is the vestigial remnant of the duct. This initially hollow structure migrates caudally and passes in close continuity with, sometimes through, the developing hyoid cartilage. The parathyroid glands develop from the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches . The thymus also develops from the 3rd pouch . As it descends, the thymus takes the associated parathyroid gland with it, which explains why the inferior parathyroid, which arises from the 3rd pharyngeal pouch, normally lies inferior to the superior gland. However, the inferior parathyroid may be found anywhere along this line of descent. The developing thyroid lobes amalgamate with the structures that arise in the fourth pharyngeal pouch , i.e., the superior parathyroid gland and the ultimobranchial body. Parafollicular cells (C cells) from the neural crest reach the thyroid via the ultimobranchial body. Pharyngeal arches</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Thyroglossal Cyst It is a cystic swelling that develops in the remnant of the thyroglossal duct or tract. It can be present in any part of the thyroglossal tract , which extends from the foramen caecum to the isthmus of the thyroid. The common sites are the sub-hyoid (most common), the floor of the mouth, the region of the thyroid cartilages, beneath the foramen caecum, and the suprahyoid. Clinical Features: It is usually a midline swelling , except in the region of the thyroid cartilage, where the thyroglossal tract is pushed to one side, usually to the left. Although it is a congenital swelling, it is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 30 years . The cyst can be moved sideways but not vertically. It has a peculiar characteristic that helps distinguish it from other neck swellings: It moves up with protrusion of the tongue because the thyroglossal tract is attached to the tongue. It moves with deglutition . Treatment involves the Sistrunk operation , which is an en-bloc cystectomy and excision of the central hyoid bone to minimize recurrence.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Thyroglossal cyst is lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium and squamous epithelium , with heterotopic thyroid tissue present in 20% of cases. Complications of thyroglossal cysts include recurrent infections, formation of thyroglossal fistula, and carcinomatous change (papillary carcinoma).</p>\n<p></p>",

There is an extensive lymphatic network within and around the gland. RLN recurs around the arch of the aorta on the left and the subclavian artery on the right. The clinical significance of this is that on the left the nerve has more distance in which to reach the tracheoesophageal groove, which runs in a medial plane. On the right, there is less distance and the nerve runs more obliquely to reach the tracheoesophageal groove. The nerve runs posterior to the thyroid and enters the larynx at the cricothyroid joint. It enters at the level of Berry\u2019s ligament, a condensation of pre-tracheal fascia that binds the thyroid to the trachea.

Whereas, intermittent administration of recombinant human PTH stimulates bone formation more than resorption. Statement 1.

Nuclear Imaging with Sestamibi Scan is now regarded as the most accurate and reliable method for imaging the parathyroid glands, with an added advantage over Ultrasound , which is better imaging of glands in ectopic positions. Parathyroid adenomas often have a high concentration of oxyphilic cells with high mitochondrial content. Sestamibi accumulates in mitochondria and washes out at differential rates depending on the number of mitochondria within these cells. There are three different protocols for SESTAMIBI scanning: Single-isotope dual-phase scan, Dual isotope subtraction imaging, and Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Preoperative imaging is crucial in identifying the location and number of abnormal parathyroid glands in primary hyperparathyroidism to aid in surgical planning.

Address or rule out pheochromocytoma first Familial isolated HPT CDKNIB AD pHPT (80%), pituitary adenoma (40%), pNETs, adrenal, thyroid, gonadal and renal tumors 50 Same as MEN1 Familial isolated HPT MENI, COC73, CASH, GCM2, CDKN1B AD Isolated pHPT, parathyroid carcinoma (GCM2 mutation) 39 Bilateral neck exploration with resection of enlarged glands only versus subtotal parathyroidectomy En bloc resection for parathyroid cancer HPT-JT COC73 AD pHPT in second or third decade, parathyroid carcinoma (35%). ossifying fibromas of mandible and maxilla, renal cysts, hamartomas and Wilms tumor, and uterine tumors 32 Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy with IOPTH or bilateral exploration En bloc resection for parathyroid cancer AD, Autosomal dominant; HPT, hyperparathyroidism; HPT-JT, hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome; IOPTH, intraoperative parathyroid hormone; MEN, multiple endocrine neoplasia, MTC, medullary thyroid cancer; pHPT, primary hyperparathyroidism; PTH; parathyroid hormone; PNET, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. *Age mean age at presentation of primary HPT in years. \"Surgical approach to HPT associated with the disorder.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. MEN 1 gene is involved in MEN 1 Syndrome Option: B. HRPT2 gene is related to hyperparathyroid-jaw tumor syndrome. Option: C. RET proto-oncogene is linked to MEN 2A-associated hyperparathyroidism. Rule out phaeochromocytoma & medullary thyroid carcinoma.</p>\n<p></p>",
