This is essential to maintain the efficacy and viability of the platelets.

This extends the shelf life while maintaining the quality of the red blood cells. Cryoprecipitate : Shelf life is 1 year when stored at temperatures below -18\u00b0C. Cryoprecipitate is used for patients with clotting factor deficiencies, such as hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease. Granulocytes concentrate : Shelf life is 24 hours.

The elevated pCO2 of 60 mmHg (normal: 35-45 mmHg) points to a respiratory cause of the acidosis, specifically respiratory acidosis. In COPD patients, chronic CO2 retention is common, leading to increased bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels as a compensatory mechanism. However, in acute respiratory acidosis, the metabolic compensation is typically inadequate, as seen by the HCO3- level of 28 mEq/L (normal: 22-28 mEq/L).
