Genital warts, primarily caused by HPV types 6 and 11, are highly infectious, especially during periods when lesions are visible and active. Abstaining from sexual activity when lesions are present significantly reduces the risk of transmitting the virus to a partner. Unlike other sexually transmitted infections, there is no effective antiviral prophylaxis available for HPV, making abstinence during active outbreaks a critical preventive measure.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Use condoms consistently during all sexual activity While condoms can reduce the risk of HPV transmission, they do not provide complete protection, especially since HPV can infect areas not covered by a condom. This measure is beneficial but less effective than abstaining from sexual contact during active outbreaks.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Use condoms consistently during all sexual activity</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Apply antiviral prophylaxis before sexual activity There are currently no effective antiviral medications available for the prophylaxis of HPV infection. Topical treatments, such as imiquimod and podophyllotoxin, are used to treat active lesions but do not prevent the transmission of HPV.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Apply antiviral prophylaxis before sexual activity</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Vaccinate her husband with the HPV vaccine The HPV vaccine is effective in preventing HPV-related conditions, including genital warts, in individuals who have not been previously exposed to the virus types covered by the vaccine. However, it does not provide immediate protection and is not effective as a post-exposure treatment or in preventing transmission of existing infections.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Vaccinate her husband with the HPV vaccine</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Genital warts, caused by HPV, are highly contagious, especially when lesions are active. The best preventive measure is to avoid sexual contact during periods of visible lesions, as there is no antiviral prophylaxis available. Condoms reduce but do not eliminate transmission risk, and vaccines are preventative but not curative once infection has occurred.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

This recommendation is based on the following considerations:</li><li>\u2022 Lung Maturity: GDM pregnancies are associated with a delay in fetal lung maturity. Routine delivery before 39 weeks is generally not recommended to avoid respiratory complications in the newborn. Induction of Labor: If the patient with well-controlled GDM has not delivered spontaneously by 39 weeks, induction of labor should be scheduled at or after 39 weeks to minimize the risks associated with GDM and to ensure fetal maturity.</li><li>\u2022 Lung Maturity: GDM pregnancies are associated with a delay in fetal lung maturity.
