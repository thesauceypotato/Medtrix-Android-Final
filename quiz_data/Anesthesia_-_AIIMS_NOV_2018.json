      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Ventricular dysrhythmias are uncommon in children Ventricular dysrhythmias are not a common cause of cardiac arrest in children. Hypoxia-induced bradycardia is more important cause and that is why rescue breaths are more important in pediatric resuscitation. The ratio of ventilation to compression in an infant is 3:1 and in children with 2 rescuers is 15:2. The reason we give more ventilation in children is because most of the cardiac arrest in pediatric age group is due to respiratory failure and not due to primary cardiac event. So more ventilation has better outcome.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Sitting with neck flexed For NG tube Ideal position is sitting with neck flexed (if conscious) In comatose patients\u2014Supine with neck flexed Supine with neck extended is ideal for ET intubation. Equipment Needed: Ryle's tube (nasogastric tube) Water-soluble lubricant Adhesive tape A syringe (usually 50 mL) A stethoscope A cup of water or a glass of water with a straw for the patient Procedure: Prepare the Patien t: Explain the procedure to the patient, ensuring they understand the purpose and what to expect. Obtain informed consent from the patient or their legal guardian. Assemble all necessary equipment and ensure it is within easy reach. Position the Patient: Place the patient in a sitting position, with the head slightly forward and the neck slightly extended. This helps facilitate the passage of the tube into the stomach.</p>\n<p></p>",
