Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk of colorectal cancer, with risk factors including the extent of colitis, the duration of disease, and the histological severity of inflammation. Eight to ten years after the initial diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, patients should receive colonoscopies with biopsies every 1\u20133 years to screen for Colorectal cancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Colorectal Cancer: Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the UK, with approximately 42,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Colon cancer represents about two-thirds of cases, while rectal cancer accounts for the remaining one-third. Men are more affected than women, with 56% of cases occurring in men. The adenoma-carcinoma sequence is the prevailing theory on how most colorectal cancers develop. The APC gene is mutated early in the carcinogenesis process and is present in two-thirds of colonic adenomas. K-ras mutations are more commonly found in larger lesions, indicating a later occurrence in the mutagenesis process. The p53 gene is frequently mutated in carcinomas but not in adenomas, making it a marker of invasion.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a thrombotic microangiopathy and complication of diarrheal bacterial infection, particularly with Entero hemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Though this patient has a 1-month history of diarrhea, the typical presentation of HUS is the triad of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and impaired renal function that develops 5\u201310 days after the onset of diarrheal illness. Additionally, HUS typically affects young children. Option: B. Oral ulcers are a typical complication of Crohn disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that also causes abdominal cramping and diarrhea. Unlike ulcerative colitis, which only affects the colon and rectum, Crohn disease can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. However, in Crohn disease, the rectum is usually spared, and the condition mostly presents with watery, nonbloody stools and with just a slight increase in stool frequency as opposed to this patient showing bloody stools with mucus and a marked increase in stool frequency. Furthermore, RLQ pain is more common in Crohn disease. Option: C. Gastric cancer has multiple risk factors, but ulcerative colitis is not among them. Risk factors for gastric cancer include a diet rich in nitrates and salt, alcohol use, H. pylori infection, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>A recent international consortium identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) of colorectal cancer based on gene expression analysis in over 4000 patients. CMS1 is characterized by MSI, a feature of Lynch syndrome, which may occur sporadically, mainly in right-sided tumors. CMS2 is characterized by WNT and MYC signaling activation. CMS3 is characterized by metabolic dysregulation. CMS4 is characterized by transforming growth factor beta activation.</p>\n<p></p>",

Colonic granulomas are often seen in Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that causes abdominal cramping and diarrhea. Unlike ulcerative colitis, which only affects the colon and rectum, Crohn's disease can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus (the most commonly applied site is the terminal ileum). However, Crohn's disease usually spares the rectum and typically features grossly non-bloody diarrhea (although stool is often positive for occult blood). In addition, ileocolonoscopy in a patient with active Crohn's disease would more likely show linear ulcers, pinpoint lesions, a characteristic cobblestone appearance of the mucosa, and perianal fissures or fistulas. Option: C. Gastric cancer has multiple risk factors, but ulcerative colitis is not among them. Risk factors for gastric cancer include a diet rich in nitrates and salt, alcohol use, H. pylori infection, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Option: D.

Still, this process may only sometimes occur in an orderly manner. The hematogenous spread of colon cancer commonly occurs in the liver via th e portal vein. One-third of patients have liver metastases at diagnosis, and 50% develop metastases at some point, accounting for most deaths. The lungs are the following most common site of metastatic disease Spread to the ovaries, brain, kidney, and bone is less common Colorectal cancer can also spread from the serosa of the bowel or via subperitoneal lymphatics to other structures within the peritoneal cavity, such as the peritoneum, ovary, and omentum</p>\n<p></p>",

After ten years from diagnosis, the risk is approximately 1%, increasing to 10-15% at 20 years and 20% at 30 years. Patients with pancolitis lasting more than ten years should be enrolled in endoscopic screening programs to detect dysplasia, which is predictive of increased cancer risk. The value of screening programs is somewhat controversial, as most patients with UC who develop cancer (approximately 3.5% of all patients) do so between attendances for screening colonoscopy.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pancreatic Carcinoma The patient findings are consistent with Peutz Jeghers syndrome. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare autosomal dominant condition caused by a hyperactive serine-threonine kinas e due to a gain of function mutation on the STK11 gene on chromosome 19 . Patients with PJS develop melanotic macules on the lips , buccal mucosa, genitalia, palms, and soles as well as gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps characterized by normal colonic epithelium and branching muscularis mucosae. Possible complications of the hamartomatous polyps include bleeding and intussusception . Individuals with PJS are also at increased risk of colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, and breast cancer malignancies.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Peutz-Jeghers syndrome Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is characterized by multiple polyps in the small intestine, and to a lesser extent, the colon and rectum. Melanin spots on the buccal mucosa and lips are often observed in patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. The polyps in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are hamartomas and are not typically associated with an increased risk of malignancy, but carcinoma may occasionally develop. Surgery for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is usually reserved for patients with symptoms such as obstruction or bleeding or those who develop adenomatous features in their polyps. Screening for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome involves a baseline colonoscopy and upper endoscopy at age 20, followed by annual flexible sigmoidoscopy . Clinicians should also screen patients for extraintestinal malignancies , such as breast, upper gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, cervix, ovaries, and testicles.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is not associated with an increased risk of mandibular osteomas. Mandibular osteomas and soft tissue tumors (e.g., desmoid tumors, sebaceous cysts) are associated with Gardner syndrome, a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which would present with colonic polyps. However, the polyps in FAP would be adenomatous rather than hamartomatous, and patients with FAP typically have thousands of polyps. Option: B. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is not associated with an increased risk of pheochromocytoma. The risk of pheochromocytoma is increased in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), and multiple endocrine neoplasias (MEN) types 2. NF1 can cause hyperpigmented macules (caf\u00e9 au lait spots), intestinal neuromas, and hamartomatous nodules in the iris (Lisch nodules). Still, the caf\u00e9 au lait spots would be seen on the trunk in association with cutaneous neurofibromas, and hamartomatous intestinal polyps would not be expected. MEN type 2A can cause intestinal neuromas, and VHL can cause cavernous intestinal hemangiomas, but neither MEN type 2A, nor VHL would be associated with hamartomatous polyps or perioral hyperpigmented macules. Option: C. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is not associated with an increased risk of medulloblastoma . Brain tumors such as medulloblastoma and gliomas are associated with Turcot syndrome, a familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) variant that would manifest with colonic polyps. However, the polyps in FAP would be adenomatous rather than hamartomatous, and patients with FAP typically have thousands of polyps.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>PJS exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance, with chromosome 19p13.3 encoding the serine-threonine kinase LKB1/STK11.

This contrast-enhanced CT scan shows multiple hypodense solitary lesions with peripheral rim enhancement in both lobes of the liver, characteristic of hepatic metastases. These features suggest a primary colorectal malignancy that has metastasized to the liver, the most frequent metastatic site for this condition. The palpable hepatomegaly with a hard nodule and mildly deranged liver function tests are caused by the metastatic deposits.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Colorectal Carcinoma: Surgery is recommended only for patients with recurrence of colorectal carcinoma with isolated metastasis in the liver, lung, ovaries, or anastomotic sites. Pulmonary Metastasis: Prognosis is based on several factors, including the number and size of metastases, lymph node involvement, additional metastatic sites, and pre-thoracotomy CEA levels. Primary disease-free survival or colorectal cancer stage does not significantly affect survival rates after thoracotomy. Prophylactic Bilateral Oophorectomy: It may be recommended for postmenopausal women with a history of colorectal cancer. The incidence of ovarian cancer is five times higher in women with a history of colorectal cancer. The prevention of primary ovarian cancer is considered to be the main benefit of prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. A liver hemangioma, when symptomatic, causes upper gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, nausea, early satiety) in contrast to this patient's primarily lower gastrointestinal symptoms (intermittent constipation with abdominal distention). Furthermore, liver hemangiomas do not cause weight loss or blood in the stool. On contrast-enhanced CT scan, a liver hemangioma can also appear as a hypodense lesion with peripheral rim enhancement but are usually solitary. Option: B. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHC) may present with weight loss and hepatomegaly in the absence of cholestasis (jaundice, pruritus), as in this patient. On contrast-enhanced CT scans, a mass-forming IHC is seen as a hypodense lesion with peripheral rim enhancement. However, IHCs are usually solitary, and the center of the lesion shows heterogenic echogenicity (compared to the anechoic centers in this patient) and dilation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. IHCs do not cause constipation or occult blood in stool, and ALP is usually elevated in IHC but is normal in this patient. Option: C. Echinococcus granulosus is endemic in Mexico. This patient's travel history to Mexico is a risk factor for the development of a hepatic echinococcal cyst (hydatid cyst), and the infection may be asymptomatic for months, presenting with tender hepatomegaly when large enough. However, echinococcal cysts do not cause constipation, fever, or weight loss. A hepatic echinococcal cyst is seen on contrast-enhanced CT scan (CECT) as an anechoic cyst with multiple septations and individual \"daughter cysts\u201d within the main cyst. The septations give the cyst a characteristic spoke wheel pattern. This patient's history and CECT with multiple solid, nonseptate lesions that have a peripheral rim enhancement suggest another diagnosis.</p>\n<p></p>",

Diagnosis is usually made through proctoscopy with biopsy, with CT of the abdomen and pelvis used to evaluate distant metastasis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Abdominoperineal resection (APR) is indicated in certain patients with low-lying rectal adenocarcinomas that cannot be treated with sphincter-sparing procedures and those with adenocarcinomas of the anal canal. Adenocarcinomas of the anal canal, however, are rare and not the most likely diagnosis in this young patient without a family history of colorectal cancer or other predisposing factors like inflammatory bowel disease, smoking, or alcohol consumption. Option: C. Local cytostatic treatment with 5-fluorouracil is indicated in patients with anogenital warts (i.e., condylomata acuminate). Although anogenital warts may manifest as painful lesions, like those seen in this patient, they usually present as cauliflower-like lumps, not a hard mass, and rectal bleeding is a rare sequela. Option: D. Total mesorectal excision is usually performed with low anterior resection in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma. However, the patient's tumor is just above the anal verge, within the anal canal, rather than the rectum. In addition, adenocarcinoma is unlikely in a young patient without predisposing factors such as a family history of colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, smoking, or alcohol consumption.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Treatment of choice is chemoradiation with the Nigro regimen, which cures more than 80% of patients.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>KRAS The patient has right-sided colorectal cancer. Most sporadic cases of colorectal carcinoma arise from the chromosomal instability pathway (i.e., the adenoma-carcinoma sequence ). A loss-of-function mutation of the tumor suppressor gene APC in this pathway results in decreased intercellular adhesion and increased epithelial proliferation. Next, a gain-of-function mutation in the KRAS proto-oncogene results in unregulated cellular signaling and cellular proliferation , predisposing to adenoma formation. Finally, loss-of-function mutations of additional tumor suppressor genes (e.g., TP53, DCC) result in the malignant transformation of an adenoma to carcinoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Colorectal cancers develop from adenomatous polyps through genetic mutation s influenced by environmental factors. The adenoma-carcinoma sequence is a well-supported theory based on observational evidence. Still, the progression of mutations is a complex series of genetic alterations that eventually lead to an invasive tumor. APC gene mutations occur early in the process of carcinogenesis, while K-ras mutations are later events and are more frequently found in larger lesions. The p53 gene is frequently mutated in carcinomas but not in adenomas and is considered a marker of invasion. An international consortium has identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) of colorectal cancer based on gene expression analysis: CMS1 (sporadic MSI), CMS2 (WNT and MYC signaling activation), CMS3 (metabolic dysregulation), and CMS4 (transforming growth factor beta activation).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. A loss-of-function mutation (not a gain-of-function mutation) in the tumor suppressor gene Deleted in Colon Cancer (DCC ) is a late event in the chromosomal instability pathway (i.e., the adenoma-carcinoma sequence). It promotes the malignant transformation of an adenoma into a carcinoma. Option: B. A loss-of-function mutation (not a gain-of-function mutation) in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 is a late event in the chromosomal instability pathway (i.e., the adenoma-carcinoma sequence). It promotes the malignant transformation of an adenoma into a carcinoma. Normally, TP53 is activated in response to DNA damage and ultimately inhibits G1-S progression and allows DNA repair to occur. TP53 can also activate apoptosis if DNA damage is irreparable. Mutations in TP53, therefore, result in unregulated progression through the cell cycle and the accumulation of genetic errors. Loss-of-function mutations in TP53 are associated with most human cancers and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Option: C. The microsatellite instability pathway is characterized by a loss-of-function mutation (not a gain-of-function mutation) or epigenetic silencing (i.e., promoter hypermethylation) of mismatch repair genes, including MLH1 and can result in the development of colorectal carcinoma. This mechanism underlies Lynch syndrome. However, it is an uncommon cause of sporadic cases of colorectal carcinoma</p>\n<p></p>",

A diet high in saturated or polyunsaturated fats increases the risk of colorectal cancer, while a diet high in oleic acid does not increase the risk.

Genetic testing should be performed in patients with a strong family history of colon cancer. The condition is due to a germline mutation in a DNA mismatch repair gene.

In addition to colon cancer, patients are at extremely high risk for endometrial carcinoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Lynch syndrome Lynch syndrome is a genetic condition previously known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). It is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation in one of four DNA mismatch repair genes ( MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 ). Lynch syndrome increases the risk of colorectal cancer and cancers of the endometrium, ovary, stomach and small intestine, urinary tract, pancreas, prostate, and kidney. The DNA mismatch repair genes code for proteins that repair sporadic mutations in other genes. Faulty DNA mismatch repair genes lead to microsatellite instability (MSI) and acceleration of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Individuals with Lynch syndrome tend to develop colorectal polyps at an early age that quickly become cancerous. The lifetime risk of developing cancer in individuals with Lynch syndrome is 80% . Most cancers associated with Lynch syndrome develop in the proximal colon. Females with Lynch syndrome have a 30-50% lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer.

Extended colectomy is considered for patients with polyps or cancer that cannot be managed with endoscopic polypectomy. Early surveillance and intervention can help manage the accelerated pathway to cancer in Lynch syndrome.</p>\n<p></p>",

A barium meal establishes THE extent of the disease and follow-through, showing a string sign of Kantor. Option: D. Angiodysplasia - Angiodysplasia is a thin-walled arteriovenous communication located within the mucosa and submucosa of the intestine, usually the ascending colon and caecum. The typical presentation is lower gastrointestinal bleeding that can be overt or occult.</p>\n<p></p>",

The risk of this cancer increases with age.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Rectal carcinoma : The rectum is the most common site for colorectal cancer , with adenocarcinoma being the most common type. Multiple tumors can be found in 5% of cases. Carcinoma rectum usually presents as an ulcer , but polypoid and infiltrating types are also common. Carcinoma rectum typically presents in patients above 55 years of age . Bleeding is the earliest and most common symptom, while a sense of incomplete defecation may also be present. Back pain or sciatica can occur when cancer invades the sacral plexus . Weight loss is suggestive of hepatic metastases .: Sigmoidoscopy (rigid, not flexible) and biopsy are the investigations of choice for the diagnosis of carcinoma rectum.
