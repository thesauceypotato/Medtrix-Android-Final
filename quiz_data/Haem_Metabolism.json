Hemoglobin exists in two forms: Taut (tense) form (T) Relaxed form (R). Various factors favor the taut form: Low pH high CO 2 high 2, 3 BPG at the level of the tissues The taut form has low oxygen affinity than the R state and releases oxygen in the tissues. Oxidation of Hb means oxidation of metal-iron (from the ferrous to the ferric state) in the heme portion of hemoglobin making metHb. MetHb cannot bind oxygen. Oxygenation of Hb means oxygen is attached to Hb. The iron atom is still in the ferrous state.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Increase in pH In the oxygen dissociation curve (ODC) of Hb, the partial pressure of oxygen is plotted on the X-axis, and the percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen is plotted on the Y-axis. We get a sigmoidal curve for hemoglobin. A shift of the oxygen dissociation curve to the right refers to the increased unloading of oxygen. Imagine a person doing exercise in a warm room. Raised CO2, temperature, 2,3-DPG, and decreased pH causes shift of ODC to right.</p>\n<p></p>",
