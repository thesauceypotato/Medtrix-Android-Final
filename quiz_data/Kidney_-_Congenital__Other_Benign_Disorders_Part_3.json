Fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy would address pyelonephritis and urosepsis, but if acute UTI is not treated, the patient will develop acute kidney injury, which has a high mortality rate. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy, which requires only minimal anesthesia, is indicated to rapidly decompress the renal collecting system until a more definitive therapy for the renal stone can be performed. Early decompression is required because an untreated acute UTO can result in permanent kidney injury.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy PCNL involves the removal of renal stones by creating a track between the skin and the pelvicalyceal system. Typically, this procedure is done in a prone position. Fluoroscopy, or US, is used for localization. The posterolateral calyx is commonly chosen for entry. The In conjunction with pneumatic and laser lithotripsy, US is the most common energy source used. Complications include bleeding, infection, and pleural violation in cases of supracostal puncture. Severe bleeding may require selective angioembolization. Indications for percutaneous nephrolithotomy Renal stones >2 cm. Lower pole renal stones with anatomy that is unfavorable for SWL.

Ureteroscopy and stent placement are viable options for decompressing the renal collecting system in patients with UTO. However, in hemodynamically unstable patients such as this, a method that requires less anesthesia and provides more rapid and reliable decompression is preferable. Option: C. Shock wave lithotripsy may be used to treat renal calculi that are larger than 10 mm, which is the case in this patient. However, manipulating the calculus in any way can result in life-threatening sepsis in a patient with urolithiasis and a concomitant UTI. Therefore, definitive stone management must be deferred until the UTI is treated. Option: D. Nephrectomy and antibiotic therapy is the recommended first-line therapy for patients with severe emphysematous pyelonephritis and signs of acute renal failure or septic shock. This patient's diabetes mellitus and UTO are risk factors for emphysematous pyelonephritis, which would be indistinguishable from severe acute pyelonephritis. However, the absence of gas within the renal parenchyma and collecting duct system on abdominal CT suggests that this patient does not have emphysematous pyelonephritis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Miniaturized PCNL (e.g., mini-perc) involves using smaller access tracks.

These beverages increase diuresis and, in the context of UPJ, cause hydronephrosis as a large amount of urine overwhelms the narrowed UPJ. This manifests as episodic flank pain, as seen in this patient.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction, also often called pelvic ureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction, describes an incomplete and intermittent reduction in urine flow from the kidney to the proximal ureter. Incidence : Occurs in 1 in 1000 live births with a male and left-sided predominance. It is the most common cause of severe antenatal hydronephrosis. Pathology : Commonly a disruption of circular muscle or collagen fibers in the proximal ureter results in an intrinsic narrowing near the renal pelvis. Extrinsic compression is less common and results from an aberrant renal vessel compressing the ureteropelvic junction. Presentation / Diagnosis : Most cases are diagnosed in the postnatal evaluation of an antenatally detected hydronephrosis. However, some newborns present with an abdominal or flank mass and a history of urinary tract infection or haematuria. Older children may present with severe intermittent fank or abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting, known as Dietl\u2019s crisis.

Bilateral renal cysts are seen in patients with adult polycystic kidney disease. Though patients with ADPKD can also present with flank pain (secondary to cyst rupture, bleeding, or infection), they also tend to have early-onset hypertension, renal insufficiency, and a positive family history of polycystic kidney disease. Option: B. Glomerular IgA deposits are seen in IgA nephropathy (Berger disease). IgA nephropathy generally presents as episodic haematuria 1-3 days following an upper respiratory infection. Intermittent flank pain, as seen in this patient, is not a characteristic symptom of IgA nephropathy. Option: C. Posterior urethral valves are usually diagnosed prenatally or in the first months of life. Typically, neonates will present with recurrent UTIs secondary to increased bladder pressure and subsequent vesicoureteral reflux.
