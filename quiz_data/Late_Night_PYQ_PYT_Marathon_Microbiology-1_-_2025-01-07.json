B) Aspergillus</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Farmers often suffer from injuries involving organic matter. The presence of a traumatic ulcer in the eye coupled with the identification of septate hyphae points toward a fungal infection.</li><li>\u2022 Between Mucor and Aspergillus, the distinguishing factor is the type of hyphae. Aspergillus forms septate hyphae, meaning the hyphae have regular, cross-wall divisions. In contrast, Mucor forms aseptate (or coenocytic) hyphae, which lack these septa.</li><li>\u2022 Characteristic of Hyphae -</li><li>\u2022 Characteristic of Hyphae -</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Mucor: Although Mucor is a fungus that can cause infections, it forms aseptate hyphae. This characteristic helps differentiate it from Aspergillus in cases of fungal eye infections.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Mucor:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Streptococcus pyogenes: This bacterium can cause various infections, including those in the eye, but it does not form hyphae. Thus, it cannot be the causative organism in this scenario.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Streptococcus pyogenes:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Pseudomonas: This is another bacterium that can cause eye infections, particularly in the context of contact lens wearers, but like Streptococcus pyogenes, it does not form hyphae.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
