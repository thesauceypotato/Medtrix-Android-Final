Coup (blow; impact) means that the injury is located beneath the area of impact, and results directly from the impacting force. Option: B. Contrecoup means that the lesion is present in an area opposite the side of the impact of the body to slide relatively to each other in a direction parallel to their planes of contact\". Fracture of the skull may not occur, even in the presence of severe coup and contrecoup injuries. Option: C. Contrecoup injuries can also occur when a blow is struck on a fixed head. If a person is lying on the ground or against some other unyielding surface, a heavy blow on the upper temporal or parietal area may cause typical contrecoup injuries either in the contralateral temporal or parietal cortex or against the falx on the inner side of the ipsilateral lobe. There is often coup injury also. Mechanism: Contrecoup injury is caused when the moving head is suddenly decelerated by hitting a firm surface, e.g., striking the head on the ground during a fall, usually seen in traffic accidents. Subdural or subarachnoid haemorrhage may be caused as a contrecoup lesion. The sudden arrest of the head results in the brain which is still in motion, striking the arrested skull A blow to the head causes the skull to move forward, but the brain lags behind for a brief period and the skull strikes the brain (acceleration injury). Medicolegal Importance: A blow to the head produces coup contusions, while contrecoup contusions are either small or absent. A fall on the head produces contrecoup contusions while coup contusions are mall or absent. Contrecoup injuries are rare before the age of three years. Contrecoup injury is seen in the skull, brain, liver, heart, and lungs.</p>\n<p></p>",
