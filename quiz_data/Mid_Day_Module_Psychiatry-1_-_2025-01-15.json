This statement is true as well . Atypical antipsychotics are more effective in treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia , such as apathy, anhedonia, and affective flattening, compared to typical antipsychotics. The effectiveness of atypical antipsychotics in treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia is believed to be mediated by their action on both dopamine and serotonin receptors.

He reports a gradual increase in the severity of his symptoms over the past two months, characterized by a persistent low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, and feelings of guilt and worthlessness. His appetite has also decreased, and he has lost 5 kg during this period. The patient's family reports that he has become increasingly socially withdrawn and has stopped engaging in his usual hobbies. Three days ago, he attempted suicide and was about to hang himself, but was saved by a family member who intervened just before the attempt was made.
