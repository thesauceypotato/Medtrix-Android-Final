This is due to insulin's ability to activate enzymes involved in lipogenesis.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Hyper-ketonemia: Incorrect. Insulin suppresses ketone production, so hyperinsulinemia would prevent the formation of ketone bodies.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Hyper-ketonemia:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Increased Amino acids: Incorrect. Insulin promotes protein synthesis and reduces the level of amino acids in the blood by enhancing their uptake into cells and their incorporation into proteins.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Increased Amino acids:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Raised glucose: Incorrect. Hyperinsulinemia lowers blood glucose levels by promoting glucose uptake into cells and inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

Therefore, its use in hypoxic patients (E.g., anemia) is limited.</li><li>\u2022 Phosphate-containing solution like CPDA (Citrate, phosphate, dextrose, adenine) prevents the fall in 2.3DPG levels. Higher 2,3 DPG concentration decreases affinity of Hb to the oxygen releasing oxygen to the tissues.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Decreased release of O2 : Incorrect. The goal of effective blood storage solutions like CPDA is to ensure that the oxygen release capacity is maintained, not decreased.

P50 is a measure of the oxygen tension at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated with oxygen. A higher P50, indicative of lower oxygen affinity, is preferable in stored blood as it means oxygen is more readily released to tissues\u2014a trait supported by higher 2,3-DPG levels.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. It has less P50</li><li>\u2022 Option D. It is less acidic : Incorrect. While pH maintenance is important in blood storage, the primary benefit of CPDA over ACD is not related to less acidity but to its inclusion of phosphate and adenine, which help sustain energy (ATP) production and 2,3-DPG levels in red blood cells.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. It is less acidic</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The use of CPDA in blood storage is superior to ACD due to its phosphate content, which helps maintain higher levels of 2,3-DPG in stored red blood cells. This biochemical preservation is crucial for ensuring that transfused blood can effectively release oxygen to hypoxic tissues, making CPDA the preferred choice in clinical settings where blood transfusions are necessary.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
