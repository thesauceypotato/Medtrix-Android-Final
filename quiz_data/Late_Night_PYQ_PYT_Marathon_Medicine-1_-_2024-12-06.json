In LEMS, at low rates of repetitive nerve stimulation (2-3 Hz), a decremental response is observed, similar to myasthenia gravis. However, at high rates of stimulation (20-50 Hz) or following brief exercise, an incremental response occurs, which is characteristic of LEMS. This distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis. LEMS is caused by autoantibodies directed against P/Q-type calcium channels at motor nerve terminals, which impair acetylcholine release.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.
