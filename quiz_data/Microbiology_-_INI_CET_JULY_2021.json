      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Beta 1, 3D glucan Invasive fungal infections (fungal infection of an otherwise sterile site, such as the bloodstream or deep tissues) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in situations where diagnosis and initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy is delayed. The gold standard remains histopathologic examination of biopsy material from affected tissues alongside culture. Routine fungal culture can be helpful, however results may also be confounding.  Sensitivity of culture is generally low and is largely dependent on the quality of the specimen submitted.  Also, some fungal pathogens require prolonged incubation, which can further delay diagnosis. Because of these limitations, alternative diagnostic assays for detection of IFIs, including both molecular testing and identification of fungal biomarkers, including detection of the pan-fungal biomarker 1-3 beta-d-glucan or BDG are very useful for timely detection. Beta 1, 3 glycan is a component of the cell wall of most of the fungi except in some organisms (organisms lack BDG or produce it in low amounts) Mucormycosis / Zygomycetes Cryptococcus Blastomycosis Results from this assay need to be used in conjunction with the other diagnostic procedures previously mentioned, including imaging studies, culture and histopathologic examination of biopsy material as available.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A, C, D: Chitin, ergosterol and mannose are present as part of fungal components in Mucorales.</p>\n<p></p>",
