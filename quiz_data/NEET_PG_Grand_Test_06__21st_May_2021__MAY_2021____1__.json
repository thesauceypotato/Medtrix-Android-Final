      "text": "A physiologist is interested in studying the mechanism of contraction in different muscle cells in the human body, which closely resembles that of a frog. He isolated a small part of muscle from a frog's small intestine, administered different stimuli, and observed multiple twitches. Regardless of the stimulus, he noticed that these muscle cells use actin and myosin to form a cross-bridge to generate force. During this process, calcium level also increases inside the cell. What is the mechanism by which calcium causes contraction in this particular cell type?",
