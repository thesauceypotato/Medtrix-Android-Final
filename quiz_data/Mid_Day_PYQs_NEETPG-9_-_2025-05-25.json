A) Cyanide</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Cyanide is a potent inhibitor of Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) in the electron transport chain (ETC). Complex IV is crucial for the final step of the electron transport chain, where it facilitates the transfer of electrons to oxygen, the final electron acceptor, to form water. By inhibiting Complex IV, cyanide prevents the reduction of oxygen, halting ATP production and leading to cellular hypoxia and energy failure.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

It is a byproduct of cellular respiration and does not interfere with the function of the ETC complexes.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Carbon Dioxide:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Oligomycin: Oligomycin is an inhibitor of ATP synthase (Complex V) in the electron transport chain.
