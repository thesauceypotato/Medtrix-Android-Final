So, this order incorrectly places oxaloacetate at the beginning, even though it is the last compound to regenerate in the cycle.</li><li>\u2022 (C) Citrate, oxaloacetate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate: This order is incorrect because after the formation of citrate, the TCA cycle progresses to the formation of \u03b1-ketoglutarate before oxaloacetate is eventually regenerated. So, oxaloacetate should not come immediately after citrate.</li><li>\u2022 (D) \u03b1-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetate, citrate: This option is incorrect because \u03b1-ketoglutarate is formed later in the cycle, after citrate undergoes transformations.
