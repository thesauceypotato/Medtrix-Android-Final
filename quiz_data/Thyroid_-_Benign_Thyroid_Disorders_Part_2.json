      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Central compartment nodes. The thyroid gland has a rich lymphatic supply and drains primarily to the central compartment or level VI nodes .

Although most thyroid lesions drain to these regions, occasionally drainage from the upper poles can be to the parapharyngeal part. Option: A & B. Papillary thyroid cancer (the most common malignancy of the thyroid) metastasizes often and early, so many nodes in central and lateral compartments of the neck may be involved. However, this is not always obvious on clinical examination or even imaging. Interestingly, even though micro-metastases are present in up to 40% of patients considered free of disease, micro-metastases rarely progress to cause clinical recurrence and therefore elective neck dissection is not routinely advocated.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is effective in treating both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. It has a long half-life and a large distribution volume, which means it can accumulate in various tissues, including the lungs, liver, and skin. This can lead to various adverse effects, including pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and It can also cause thyroid dysfunction , including both hypo- and hyperthyroidism . This is due to the high iodine content of the drug, which can interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion. It interacts with various other drugs, including digoxin, warfarin, and statins . It can prolong the QT interval , increasing the risk of torsades de pointes, a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. It is contraindicated in patients with severe sinus node dysfunction, second or third-degree atrioventricular block, and those with hypersensitivity to iodine . It should also be used cautiously in patients with severe liver or lung disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B.
