Hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinemia is the most important side effect which can be prevented by infusing quinine in 5% dextrose. Quinine: Pharmacokinetics Quinine is rapidly and completely absorbed orally. It is 70% bound to plasma proteins, especially \u03b11 acid glycoprotein, which increases during acute malarial infection. CSF concentrations are low. A large fraction of the dose is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 and excreted in urine with a t\u00bd of 10\u201312 hours. Quinine is noncumulative.</p>\n<p></p>",
