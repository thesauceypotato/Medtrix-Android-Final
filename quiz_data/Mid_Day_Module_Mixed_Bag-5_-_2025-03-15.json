Vomiting: Severe vomiting that precedes the onset of pain, leading to esophageal rupture. Dyspnea or Shortness of Breath: Due to leakage of air and fluids into the chest cavity, causing pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Subcutaneous Emphysema: Air leaks from the esophagus into the chest wall, causing a characteristic crackling sensation when the skin is palpated. Shock: Severe cases may lead to shock due to sepsis or hypovolemia. Hamman's Sign: A crunching or rasping sound synchronous with the heartbeat, heard over the precordium or left lateral chest wall on auscultation, caused by heartbeats displacing air-filled tissues. Abdominal Pain and Tenderness: Especially if the perforation is near the lower part of the esophagus. Fever: A response to inflammation and infection.</li><li>\u2022 Chest Pain: Sudden and severe pain that may radiate to the back, neck, or abdomen, often exacerbated by swallowing.</li><li>\u2022 Chest Pain:</li><li>\u2022 Vomiting: Severe vomiting that precedes the onset of pain, leading to esophageal rupture.</li><li>\u2022 Vomiting:</li><li>\u2022 Dyspnea or Shortness of Breath: Due to leakage of air and fluids into the chest cavity, causing pleural effusion or pneumothorax.</li><li>\u2022 Dyspnea or Shortness of Breath:</li><li>\u2022 Subcutaneous Emphysema: Air leaks from the esophagus into the chest wall, causing a characteristic crackling sensation when the skin is palpated.</li><li>\u2022 Subcutaneous Emphysema:</li><li>\u2022 Shock: Severe cases may lead to shock due to sepsis or hypovolemia.</li><li>\u2022 Shock:</li><li>\u2022 Hamman's Sign: A crunching or rasping sound synchronous with the heartbeat, heard over the precordium or left lateral chest wall on auscultation, caused by heartbeats displacing air-filled tissues.</li><li>\u2022 Hamman's Sign:</li><li>\u2022 Abdominal Pain and Tenderness: Especially if the perforation is near the lower part of the esophagus.</li><li>\u2022 Abdominal Pain and Tenderness:</li><li>\u2022 Fever: A response to inflammation and infection.</li><li>\u2022 Fever:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

D) REM</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The stage of sleep indicated by the arrow is REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. This can be identified based on the specific patterns observed in the EEG (Electroencephalogram), EMG (Electromyogram), and EOG (Electrooculogram) readings:</li><li>\u2022 EEG : The EEG during REM sleep shows low-amplitude, high-frequency waves that are similar to the wakeful state. This pattern is characteristic of REM sleep and is often described as \"sawtooth\" waves. EMG : The EMG during REM sleep shows a flat line, indicating muscle atonia. This muscle atonia is a defining feature of REM sleep, where most of the body's voluntary muscles are temporarily paralyzed. This prevents the sleeper from acting out their dreams. EOG : The EOG during REM sleep shows rapid movements of the eyes, which is where REM sleep gets its name. These rapid eye movements are indicative of the intense brain activity occurring during this stage, despite the body's overall lack of movement.</li><li>\u2022 EEG : The EEG during REM sleep shows low-amplitude, high-frequency waves that are similar to the wakeful state.

Muscle tone is reduced but not absent as in REM sleep. Eye movements are either slow or absent, depending on the specific NREM stage.</li><li>\u2022 NREM stages generally have higher amplitude, lower frequency EEG patterns.</li><li>\u2022 Muscle tone is reduced but not absent as in REM sleep.</li><li>\u2022 Eye movements are either slow or absent, depending on the specific NREM stage.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. NREM 2 : This stage of sleep is characterized by sleep spindles and K-complexes on the EEG, with reduced but not absent muscle tone and minimal eye movement. The patterns described in the question do not match this stage.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. NREM 2</li><li>\u2022 Option B. NREM 3 : Known as slow-wave sleep or deep sleep, NREM 3 is characterized by high-amplitude, low-frequency delta waves on the EEG.

The head of the talus articulates with the navicular bone, which is a boat-shaped bone important for the passage of the dorsalis pedis artery. The navicular bone articulates with the three cuneiforms (medial, intermediate, and lateral) and the first three metatarsals. These bones, along with the medial half of the calcaneus, participate in the medial longitudinal arch of the foot.</li><li>\u2022 The 4th and 5th metatarsals, the cuboid bone, and the lateral half of the calcaneus contribute to the lateral longitudinal arch. It is important to note that the phalanges do not participate in the arches of the foot, as demonstrated by the case of New Zealand cricketer Martin Guptill, who had some of his toes amputated without affecting his running and jumping abilities.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Secondary Ossification centers already present when an infant is born includes -</li><li>\u27a4 Secondary Ossification centers already present when an infant is born includes -</li><li>\u27a4 Distal femur and Proximal tibia - 7 weeks Humerus - 8 weeks Calcaneus - 3-4 th months.
