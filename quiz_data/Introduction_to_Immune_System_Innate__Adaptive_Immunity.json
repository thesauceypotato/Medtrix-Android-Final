      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dependent on Antigen-presenting cells Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) capture microbes and other antigens , transport them to secondary lymphoid organs , and display them for recognition by lymphocytes . The most efficient APCs are dendritic cells (DCs) , which are present in epithelia and most other tissues. Integrins are adhesion molecules that promote the attachment of T-cells to APCs . Signals: from APC to T cells MHC presenting Ag to TCR CD 80/86 activating CD 28 Specific cytokines from APC to T cells</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Dependent on B lymphocytes. B lymphocyte stimulation is dependent on T lymphocytes when there is a protein antigen . Option: C. Dependent on Antigen-presenting cells. The antigen cannot directly stimulate T lymphocytes . They need to be presented by APCs to T lymphocytes. Option: D. Any of the above. Incorrect</p>\n<p></p>",
