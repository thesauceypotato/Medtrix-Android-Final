Age has consistently been shown to be a risk factor for disease, regardless of the other behaviors described. Women under 20 should be screened at any pelvic examination at least once a year.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option : A & B. Sexually active women between the ages of 20 and 24 should be screened yearly, regardless of the presence or absence of risky behaviors. Since most chlamydial infections are asymptomatic in both men and women, most transmissions occur among persons who are unknowingly infected. Option : D. When symptoms are present, the test is diagnostic. Screening, by definition, is detecting a condition before symptoms occur.</p>\n<p></p>",

TETANUS: If the mother was not immunized earlier, two doses of adsorbed tetanus toxoid should be given - the first at 16- 20 weeks and the second at 20-24 weeks of pregnancy. The minimum interval between the two doses should be one month. No pregnant woman should be denied even one dose of tetanus toxoid if she is seen late in pregnancy. One booster dose will be sufficient for a woman who has been immunized earlier. When such a booster has been given, it will provide the necessary cover for subsequent pregnancies during the next five It is advised not to inject tetanus toxoid at every successive pregnancy because of the risk of hyperimmunization and side effects.</p>\n<p></p>",

Congenital infection is considered to have occurred if the infant has IgM rubella antibodies shortly after birth or if IgG antibodies persist for more than 6 months, by which time maternally derived antibodies would have disappeared. Rubella infection in a woman who becomes infected just before conception and up to the first 8-10 weeks of gestation causes multiple congenital anomalies in 90 % of infections. The defects include Ophthalmic \u2013 cataract, micro-ophthalmia, glaucoma, pigmentary retinopathy Cardiac- peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, PDA or VSD Auditory \u2013 Sensorineural deafness Craniofacial \u2013 microcephaly.</p>\n<p></p>",
