In this condition, CFTR gene codes for proteins involved in the transport of Cl- ions.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive inherited disease of the mucus and sweat glands There is a defect in ion transport of epithelial cells that affects fluid secretion in Exocrine glands (pancreas) Epithelial lining of respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive tract. Pathophysiology The primary defect in cystic fibrosis results from abnormal function of an epithelial chloride channel protein encoded by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7q 31.2 . Protein encoded by CFTR is a chloride channel through which chloride passes. The most common mutation is delta F508 In cystic fibrosis activity of the chloride channel is decreased . ENaC is inhibited by normally functioning CFTR; hence, in cystic fibrosis, ENaC activity increases , markedly augmenting sodium uptake across the apical membrane (especially in respiratory and gastrointestinal systems).

There is a risk of severe or fatal infections due to live vaccines. Whereas, in Complement deficiency, T cell and B cell immunity is intact and this is crucial for building an immune response against live vaccines.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Wiskott Aldrich syndrome : Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome(WAS) is an X- linked recessive immunodeficiency disorder, caused by mutations in the Wiskott- Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) that primarily affects the T lymphocytes. In patients with partial T cell deficiencies (e.g., partial DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome), all live viral vaccines are avoided. DiGeorge syndrome Is due to a developmental defect involving the endodermal derivatives of the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches. Cell-mediated immunity is defective due to decreased T-cells. Affected individuals also have depressed graft rejection, hypocalcemia, and cardiac defects. For severe T cell deficiencies (e.g.severe combined immunodeficiency disease [SCID], complete DiGeorge syndrome), no live viral or live bacterial vaccines should be given. Ataxia telangiectasia is caused due to mutation of the ATM gene. This gene is involved in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. This defect in DNA repair leads to impaired lg isotype switching and the formation of antigen receptors. As a result,the patient is immunodeficient with partial T Cell deficiency, and hence live vaccines are avoided.</p>\n<p></p>",
