The above image shows frog facies which are seen in juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. The case and image above are of adenoid facies.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Adenoid Facies Chronic nasal obstruction and mouth breathing lead to a characteristic facial appearance called adenoid facies. The child has an elongated face with a dull expression, open mouth, prominent and crowded upper teeth and hitched-up upper lip. The nose gives a pinched-in appearance due to disuse atrophy of alaenasi. The hard palate, in these cases, is highly arched as the moulding action of the tongue on the palate is lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Adenoids are subject to physiological enlargement in childhood. Certain children tend to generalise lymphoid hyperplasia in which adenoids also take part. Recurrent rhinitis attacks, sinusitis or chronic tonsillitis, may cause chronic adenoid infection and hyperplasia. Allergy of the upper respiratory tract may also contribute to the enlargement of adenoids. Option C. Nasal obstruction is the commonest symptom. This leads to mouth breathing. Nasal obstruction also interferes with feeding or suckling in a child. As respiration and feeding cannot occur simultaneously, a child with adenoid enlargement fails to thrive. Option D. Otitis media with effusion. Adenoids form an important cause of otitis media with effusion in children. Adenoids' waxing and waning size cause intermittent eustachian tube obstruction with fluctuating hearing loss. Impedance audiometry helps to identify the condition.</p>\n<p></p>",
