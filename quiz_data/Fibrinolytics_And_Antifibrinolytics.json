Other causes of thrombocytopenia are not evident. Discontinue heparin immediately and LMWH should be avoided. DOC for HIT is direct thrombin inhibitors like argatroban. Lepirudin can be used as an alternative. Thrombosis is present, which leads to the consumption of protein C, so giving warfarin to the patient would further decrease protein c levels and cause skin necrosis. Therefore warfarin is avoided in such patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Heparin is an anticoagulant that prevents abnormal clotting of blood. It not only prevents the formation of harmful blood clots in the legs, lungs, and heart but also stops them from growing bigger. Option: B. Platelet transfusion, also known as platelet concentrate, is used to prevent or treat bleeding in people with either a low platelet count or poor platelet function. Often this occurs in people receiving cancer chemotherapy. Preventative transfusion is often done in those with platelet levels of less than 10 x 109/L. Option: D. warfarin , is a medication that is used as an anticoagulant (blood thinner). It is commonly used to treat blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and to prevent stroke in people who have atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, or artificial heart valves.</p>\n<p></p>",

Warfarin works as an anticoagulant by inhibiting vitamin K episode reductase( VKOR) in the liver. Inhibition of VKOR decreases the synthesis of clotting factors. Overdose of warfarin can result in bleeding. Hematuria is usually the first to occur. Other common sites of bleeding are GIT Nose Under the skin ecchymosis Excessive anticoagulant effect and bleeding from warfarin can be prevented by stopping the drug and administering oral or parenteral vitamin K1( Phytonatidine) Acute bleeding can be treated by a four-factor complex or fresh-frozen plasma.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.

Factor VIII (FVIII) is an essential blood-clotting protein, also known as an anti-hemophilic factor (AHF). In humans, factor VIII is encoded by the F8 gene.
