      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Metaplasia The presence of mucous glands below the subepithelium indicates pyloric metaplasia. Metaplasia refers to the reversible transformation of one type of differentiated cell into another type of differentiated cell.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Histopathology of Acute Cholecystitis Gross : The gallbladder is enlarged The Gallbladder wall is thickened The serosa is covered by fibrin with subserosal hemorrhage The lumen is filled with turbid bile, fibrin, or pus The mucosa is hyperemic, ulcerated, or frankly necrotic Gallstones are present in 80%of cases Histology : Edema and neutrophilic inflammation Vascular congestion Abscess formation and gangrenous necrosis Later neutrophils are replaced by eosinophils (subacute) Ca2+ deposition: \u201cporcelain gallbladder\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option:A. Hyperplasia: It refers to an increase in the number of cells in a tissue or organ, resulting in the enlargement of that tissue or organ. Option:C. Hypoplasia: This refers to an underdevelopment or incomplete development of a tissue or organ, which is not likely to occur in the gallbladder. Option:D. Hypertrophy: This refers to an increase in the size of cells in a tissue or organ, rather than an increase in the number of cells.</p>\n<p></p>",
