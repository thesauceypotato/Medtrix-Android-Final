      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Resistive work of breathing Methacholine is a cholinergic agonist, which causes constriction of bronchial smooth muscle. Bronchoconstriction reduces airway radius , which increases airway resistance, and thus the resistive work of breathing.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Methacholine is a cholinergic agonist that acts on muscarinic receptors in the airway smooth muscle, causing bronchoconstriction and increased resistance to airflow. This leads to an increase in the resistive work of breathing, as the patient has to work harder to move air in and out of their lungs.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Lung compliance (A) refers to the ability of the lungs to expand and contract in response to changes in pressure. Methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction is not expected to affect lung compliance. Airway diameter (B) is reduced during bronchoconstriction, which is the goal of the methacholine challenge test. This narrowing of the airways is what leads to the symptoms experienced by the patient. Elastic work of breathing (C) refers to the work done to overcome the elastic recoil of the lungs and chest wall during breathing. Methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction is not expected to affect the elastic work of breathing.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Lung and chest wall Because of historical reasons and small\n  pressures, pulmonary pressures are always presented in cm H\u2082O.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Alveolar ventilation increases During moderate aerobic exercise, the body's oxygen demand increases, leading to an increase in alveolar ventilation to meet this demand. This increase in ventilation helps to increase oxygen uptake and delivery to the tissues, which is necessary for sustained exercise.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>During moderate aerobic exercise, oxygen consumption and CO2 production increase, but alveolar ventilation increase in proportion. But during anaerobic exercise, which is reached at workloads that exceed ~60% of the maximal workload (called the anaerobic threshold), there is increased production of muscle lactic acid, which spills over into the circulation, causing an increase in the concentration of blood lactate and a decrease in the pH of the blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. PaO2 also increases slightly due to increased oxygen delivery to the lungs Option B. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) decreases, which can lead to respiratory alkalosis if it drops too low. Option C.

This results in an increased alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient, which reflects the difference in oxygen tension between the alveoli and the arterial blood.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The A-a gradient is normally small, but it increases in conditions that impair gas exchange, such as in cases of ventilation-perfusion imbalance, leading to hypoxemia. Areas with low V/Q ratios produce hypoxemia or a decreased PaO2, which leads to (a) a decrease in the dissolved oxygen content of the blood and (b) a decrease in PaCO2, due to stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- PaCO2 and PaO2 may be normal or abnormal in this condition, depending on the extent and severity of the mismatch.

Type 2 pneumocytes are the progenitors of type 1 cells and Type II cells are important in alveolar repair as well as other lung cellular functions. One prime function of the type II cell is the production of surfactant and homeostasis.</p>\n<p></p>",
