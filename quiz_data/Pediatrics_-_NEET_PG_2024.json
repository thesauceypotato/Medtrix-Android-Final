      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Celiac disease Child with complaints of lack of weight gain, abdominal pain on eating, and poor eating habits and after advising gluten-free diet there was improvement in the general condition and weight gain, is suggestive of celiac disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>CELIAC DISEASE This is an enteropathy caused by permanent sensitivity to gluten in genetically susceptible subjects. It is the most common cause of chronic diarrhea in children over 2 yr of age in North India. The classical presentation is with small bowel diarrhea, growth failure and anemia. A temporal association of diarrhea and introduction of wheat products at weaning may be present. Onset of diarrhea before introduction of wheat products in diet negates a diagnosis of celiac disease. Examination reveals failure to thrive, loss of subcutaneous fat, clubbing, anemia, rickets and signs of other vitamin deficiencies. Diagnosis The main investigations required for making a diagnosis include: Serology- IgA antibody against tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is an ELISA based test, recommended for initial testing of celiac disease. Upper GI endoscopy- It may be normal or show absence of folds or scalloped folds. Multiple (4-6 in number) endoscopic biopsies from the bulb  and second/ third part of duodenum should be taken in all cases. Histology- The characteristic histological changes in celiac disease are increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (>30/100 enterocytes), increased crypt length, partial to total villous atrophy, decreased villous to crypt ratio and infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes in lamina propria. A and B: Celiac disease. (A) Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showing scalloping of duodenal folds (arrow); (B) duodenal histology showing total villous atrophy</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Tropical sprue is malabsorption disorder seen as diarrhea , steatorrhea, nutritional deficiency and weight loss. It is diagnosed by a small intestinal biopsy which shows a close resemblance to that in celiac disease but it is not triggered by Gluten. Option: Whipple disease is caused by T. Whipplei. Biopsy shows PAS Positive macrophages. Option: D. Intestinal malabsorption cause poor nutrient absorption.</p>\n<p></p>",
