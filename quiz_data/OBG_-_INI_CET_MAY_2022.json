Decreased levels of testosterone have an inhibitory effect on spermiogenesis i.e. azoospermia. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can be congenital or acquired. Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is divided into anosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Kallmann syndrome) and congenital normosmic isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). Low blood testosterone levels and low pituitary hormone levels confirm the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism diagnosis. A prolonged stimulated intravenous GnRH test can be useful. It is important to consider that the first endocrinological change to occur during puberty is an increase in LH, which initially occurs more in amplitude than in frequency and only at night; subsequently, both LH and FSH levels increase at night and during the day until adult levels are reached. It is difficult to differentiate between HH and delayed puberty, as low gonadotropin and testosterone levels are found in both conditions. Therefore, a definitive HH diagnosis must be confirmed only after the patient is 18 years of age.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options A, B and D are false.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

The development of pre-eclampsia may be explained by: Failure of 2nd wave of trophoblastic invasion into uterine vessels leads to decreased placental perfusion Maternal inflammatory response directed against foreign fetal antigens leading to immunological maladaptation. Maternal maladaptation to cardiovascular and inflammatory changes of normal pregnancy. Genetic factors and epigenetic influences. The basic pathology is endothelial dysfunction and vascular spasm that affects vessels supplying all organs including the brain. kidney. uterus. etc. This ischemia leads to necrosis, haemorrhage, and end-organ damage of these organs. Reduced angiotensinase activity and increased sensitivity of vessels to angiotensin II which is a vasopressor. Reduced production of nitric oxide due to endothelial dysfunction. It normally acts as a vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Increased production of endothelin 1 by endothelial cells. It is a potent vasoconstrictor.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - There\u2019s an increase in SFLT- 1 and a decrease in PIGF. sflt1 significantly inhibited VEGF- and PlGF-induced vasodilation at a level observed in patients with severe preeclampsia.

A pregnant woman can get chorioamnionitis when bacteria move upward through her vagina and into her uterus. Mismanaged chorioamnionitis can cause neonatal infection, preterm labor, HIE, cerebral palsy. periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), and other injuries and complications.</p>\n<p></p>",
