      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>LA toxicity Intralipid is an antidote for Local Anaesthetic toxicity.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Local Anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST): The classic description is of a progressive \u201cbiphasic\u201d effect on the CNS and then CVS, two areas highly sensitive to changes in tissue electrophysiology. CNS excitation (agitation, auditory change and metallic taste) progresses to seizures or CNS depression (drowsiness, coma, and respiratory arrest). This is followed by CVS excitation (tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmia, and hypertension) then depression (bradycardia, conduction block, asystole, and cardiac depression). Of particular importance is the nature of this collapse, with high incidence of LA-cardiac arrest being resistant to standard resuscitative measures. Accidental intravascular injection is the major cause of systemic toxicity, for example, regional anesthesia of the neck (interscalene block, cervical plexus block, and stellate ganglion block) can cause direct intra-arterial injection and cause rapid toxicity from early entry to the cerebral circulation. Epidural anesthesia holds a risk of intravenous injection into the engorged epidural venous plexus of the parturient, and the oral mucosa is also highly vascular. In pregnancy, the higher cardiac output will speed up absorption and with reduced plasma proteins this will increase the free fraction of LA in the plasma. 20% lipid infusion is the first safe intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) used in medicine. The mechanism by which lipids reverse local anesthetic cardiotoxicity may be increasing clearance from cardiac tissue. This nonspecific, observed extraction of local anesthetics from aqueous plasma or cardiac tissues is termed a \u201clipid sink.\u201d Another proposed mechanism is that lipids counteract local anesthetic inhibition of myocardial fatty acid oxidation , thereby enabling energy production and reversing cardiac depression .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A, B and C.
