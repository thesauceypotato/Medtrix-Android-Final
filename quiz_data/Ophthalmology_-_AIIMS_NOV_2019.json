The normal level of IOP is essentially maintained by a dynamic equilibrium between the aqueous humour formation, aqueous humour outflow and episcleral venous pressure. IOP is distributed evenly throughout the eye , so that the pressure is always the same in the posterior vitreous as it is in the aqueous humour. The intraocular pressure is important in maintaining the shape of the eyeball and thus also the optical integrity. Normal OP varies between 10.5 and 20.5mm Hg with a mean pressure of 15.5 \u2021 2.57 mm Hg</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
