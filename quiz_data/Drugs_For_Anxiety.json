      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Venlafaxine</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Sudden withdrawal of antidepressants can precipitate a discontinuation syndrome. It is seen more with short-acting drugs than longer-acting ones. For SSRIs or SNRIs, withdrawal symptoms may include dizziness, headache, nervousness, nausea, and insomnia. This withdrawal syndrome appears most intense for paroxetine and venlafaxine due to their relatively short half-lives and, Paroxetine has no active metabolites. Conversely, the active metabolite of fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, has such a long t1/2 (1\u20132 weeks) that few patients experience any withdrawal symptoms with discontinuation of fluoxetine.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B . Imipramine is known as a tricyclic antidepressant. It is used to treat depression. It is also effective in treating depression that is unresponsive to alternative treatment. It also manages nighttime bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis) by older children at different doses. Option: C . Valproate is a medication primarily used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder and prevent migraine headaches. They are helpful for the prevention of seizures in those with absence seizures, partial seizures, and generalized seizures. Option: D. Olanzapine is used in the treatment of schizophrenia (a mental disorder that can result in hallucinations or delusions and also adversely affects a person\u2019s ability to think and behave) and mania.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#Mantra Classification Of Antidepressant Drugs 1.

Benzodiazepines do not activate GABA A receptors directly, but barbiturates can activate GABA at higher doses, so barbiturates are called GABA mimmetics. Benzodiazepines act allosterically by modulating the effects of GABA. These are GABA Allosteric stimulators Benzodiazepines enhance the frequency of Cl\u00af channel opening Benzodiazepines and GABA analogs bind to their respective sites on brain membranes with nanomolar affinity Benzodiazepines modulate GABA binding, and GABA alters benzodiazepine binding in an allosteric fashion</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Agonist : An agonist is a chemical that activates a receptor to produce a biological response. Receptors are cellular proteins whose activation causes the cell to modify its current behavior. In contrast, an antagonist blocks the action of the agonist. Option: B . Partial agonists : are drugs that bind to and activate a given receptor but have only partial efficacy at the receptor relative to a full agonist. They may also be considered ligands that display both agonistic and antagonistic effects\u2014when both a full and partial agonist are present. Option: D . Antagonism An antagonist is used as a plot device to set up conflicts, obstacles, or challenges for the protagonist. Though not every story requires an antagonist, it often is used in plays to increase the level of drama. In tragedies, antagonists often cause the protagonist's main problem or lead a group of characters against the protagonist; in comedies, they are usually responsible for involving the protagonist in comedic situations.</p>\n<p></p>",
