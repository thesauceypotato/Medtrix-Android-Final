Her baseline vitals were recorded; the blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg, the heart rate was 86/min, and the cardiac monitor showed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram (ECG). The patient was maintained in an upright sitting position. The anesthesia was induced via a 25 G Quincke cutting needle inserted at L4-5 interspinous space. The subarachnoid space was at a depth of about six cms from the skin surface, and it was confirmed by the presence of clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dripping from the needle. The syringe containing the recommended standard dose of hyperbaric bupivacaine was attached to the spinal needle. The anesthesiologist overlooked the step to re-aspirate CSF into the needle and proceeded with the intrathecal administration of the drug. After completion of the injection, blood-tinged fluid dripped from the back of the spinal needle. Early in labor, the patient suddenly developed hypotension and was immediately administered with a suitable vasopressor. Soon after, the ECG showed an abnormal rhythm. The patient collapsed from the sudden arrhythmia. What is the complication that led to the systemic toxicity of the anesthetic drug?",
