      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Inhibition of elastase Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a protein produced in the liver that plays a crucial role in protecting tissues, particularly the lungs , from damage caused by enzymes released by immune cells. One of the key enzymes that AAT inhibits is elastase. Elastase is an enzyme released by neutrophils and other immune ce lls that can break down elastin, a protein important for maintaining the elasticity of tissues, including the lung tissue. Deficiency or dysfunction of AAT can lead to uncontrolled elastase activity , resulting in tissue damage , particularly in the lungs, and predisposing individuals to conditions such as emphysema .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Emphysema Emphysema is a lung disease characterized by the destruction of the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs , leading to shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. -Risk factors: The most significant risk factor for Emphysema is cigarette smoking Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Long-term exposure to air pollution and occupational exposure to dust, fumes, and chemicals. -Pathophysiology: -Features: Chronic shortness of breath, chronic cough with scanty sputum production , and reduced exercise tolerance. Wheezing, chest tightness, and weight loss. Barrel-shaped chest Expiration is prolonged and/or through pursed lips Diagnostic tests: Pulmonary function tests: Decreased FEV1/FVC ratio, decreased DLCO, and increased residual volume. Chest X-rays may show hyperinflation of the lungs with flattened diaphragms: Increased lung field lucency</p>\n<p></p>",

Chronic ITP is a relatively common dis-order that tends to affect women between the ages of 20 and 40 years. Acute ITP is a self-limited form seen mostly in children after viral infections. Antibodies directed against platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb/IIIa or Ib/IX complexes can be detected in roughly 80% of cases of chronic ITP. The spleen is an important site of anti-platelet antibody production and the major site of destruction of the IgG-coated platelets. Although splenomegaly is not a feature of uncomplicated chronic ITP, the importance of the spleen in the premature destruction of platelets is proved by the benefits of splenectomy, which normalizes the platelet count and induces a complete remission in more than two-thirds of patients.</p>\n<p></p>",

Cholesterol  gallstones  usually contain >50% cholesterol monohydrate plus an admixture of calcium salts, bile pigments, proteins, and fatty acids.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Diffuse distribution of pseudopolyps \u2022 The most common morphological difference between ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease is Crypt abscess. \u2022 Crypt abscesses, which are collections of inflammatory cells within the crypts of the intestinal glands, are a characteristic finding in ulcerative colitis. They are often seen in the inflamed mucosa and are indicative of active inflammation in the colon. \u2022 Crohn\u2019s disease is characterized by transmural inflammation that can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. Crypt abscess are not seen in Crohn\u2019s disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Gross and microscopic features of Ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease.

Mucosal edema: Mucosal edema, or swelling of the intestinal mucosa, can occur in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It is a result of the inflammatory process in the bowel wall. Option C. Crypt abscess: Crypt abscesses are present in both UC and CD, but the distribution pattern differs. While crypt abscesses are a common feature in both diseases, the distribution pattern is not the most distinguishing morphological difference. Option D. Lymphoid aggregates in the mucosa: Lymphoid aggregates, which are collections of lymphocytes and immune cells, can be observed in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. They represent an immune response to chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Difference between Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's disease Features Ulcerative colitis Crohn\u2019s disease Location Continuous colonic lesions, and rectal involvement is always present Can occur anywhere in the GI tract, usually terminal ileum and colon are involved with rectal sparing Nature of inflammation Inflammation limited to the inner lining of colon and rectum (mucosa and submucosa) Inflammation can involve all layers of the GI tract (transmural) Pattern of inflammation Continuous inflammation starting from the rectum and extending upward into the colon Patchy inflammation with areas of normal tissue in between affected areas -skip lesions Gross morphology Pseudopolyps Cobblestone mucosa, creeping fat, bowel wall thickening Microscopic morphology Crypt abscess/ulcers , bleeding, no granulomas Non-case acting Granuloma, lymphoid aggregation Symptoms Bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping, urgency and frequency of bowel movements Abdominal pain and cramping, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue Complication Malabsorption, increased risk of colorectal cancer.
