The plasma membrane of the apoptotic cell remains intact , but the membrane is altered in such a way that the cell and its fragments become avid targets for phagocytes called an \u2018Eat me\u2019 signal as Phosphatidylserine , which is normally present on the inner side of the cell, is expressed outside in Apoptotic bodies which are then recognised by macrophages, which engulfs these . The dead cell and its fragments are rapidly cleared before cellular contents have leaked out, so apoptotic cell death does not elicit an inflammatory reaction in the host.
