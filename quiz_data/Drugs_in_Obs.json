Option B: The uterus contracts within 3 to 5 minutes of beginning an oxytocin infusion, and a plasma steady state is reached in 40 minutes: This statement is correct. Oxytocin typically starts to induce uterine contractions within a few minutes of administration, and it reaches a steady state in plasma relatively quickly. Option C : When oxytocin is stopped, its concentration in plasma falls slowly because the half-life is long: This statement is incorrect. Oxytocin has a very short half-life, typically in the range of 1-6 minutes. Therefore, its concentration in plasma drops rapidly after discontinuation.

In general, oxytocin is discontinued if the number of contractions persists with a frequency of more than five in a 10-minute period or more than seven in a 15-minute period or with a persistent non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern. The uterus contracts within 3 to 5 minutes of beginning an oxytocin infusion, and a plasma steady state is reached in 40 minutes Oxytocin discontinuation nearly always rapidly lowers contraction frequency. When oxytocin is stopped, its concentration in plasma rapidly falls because the half-life is approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Uterine response to oxytocin increases from 20 to 30 weeks\u2019 gestation and rises rapidly at term.
