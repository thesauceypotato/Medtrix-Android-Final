Diabetes Insipidus eventually presents with hypernatremia. To differentiate between central and nephrogenic DI , ADH stimulation test is carried out .

The Blue diagram represents physiological response in Osmolarity as compared to ADH secretion as an increase in Serum ADH value will lead to increase in Urine Osmolarity. The same response can be seen with primary Polydipsia as is seen with the normal physiological response. The Pink Diagram signifies High plasma Vasopressin with low Urine Osmolality as is the case in Nephrogenic DIabetes Insipidus as ADH is unable to act upon the receptors in the kidney.</p>\n<p></p>",

For this the prerequisite is the presence of a solute of high osmotic quotient in the lumen of nephron tubules. This occurs in case of - tubular injury, diabetes , and mannitol So the answer for this question is mannitol Water diuresis means water is not being reabsorbed via the nephron tubules therefore urine becomes low in osmolality and in some cases plasma can become hyperosmolar e.g. Primary polydipsia (option a) and diabetes insipidus (option b and option c).</p>\n<p></p>",
