      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Give somatostatin analogue Here the patient is having a growth hormone-secreting adenoma It is also given there is a likelihood of a surgical cure Hence surgery was done . but after surgery, it was found to be that the growth hormone level was elevated Hence the next step is to give a somatostatin analogue Somatostatin analogues exert the therapeutic effect through sstr2 and sstr5 receptors, both of which are expressed by the growth hormone-secreting tumours Also, somatostatin analogues are given in frail patients experiencing morbidity or those who decline surgery</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Continue to monitor the growth hormone levels This is not the correct answer because the surgery was done because there was expected to be a surgically cured But after surgery when the measurement of growth hormone was done, it was found to be elevated and not controlled And there is no purpose in monitoring the growth hormone levels when it keeps on getting elevated The next step would be administering somatostatin analogue and monitoring the growth hormone levels Option: C. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is the last step in the management of acromegaly So here it was given the surgery was on the growth hormone level was elevated Hence the next step would be the administration of somatostatin analogue and then we have to measure the growth hormone Then we have to increase a dose of frequency of the somatostatin analogues Even if it\u2019s not working then, we have to add GH receptor antagonists or dopamine agonists And then we have to measure the growth hormone If it is elevated even after the above steps, then the final step would be considering radiation therapy for this situation Option: D Reoperation Reoperation is also the last step in the management of acromegaly So here it was given the surgery was on the growth hormone level was elevated Hence the next step would be the administration of somatostatin analogue and then we have to measure the growth hormone Then we have to increase the frequency of the dose of the somatostatin analogues Even if it\u2019s not working then, we have to add GH receptor antagonists or dopamine agonists And then we have to measure the growth hormone If it is elevated even after the above steps, then the final step would be considering a reoperation for this situation</p>\n<p></p>",
