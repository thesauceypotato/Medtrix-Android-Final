It presents with corneal opacities, keratic precipitates, and a salmon patch appearance on cornea due to its deep vascularization. It can occur due to congenital syphilis and presents at around 5-15 years age of It may be a part of Hutchinson's triad: interstitial keratitis, H utchinson's teeth. and vestibular deafness.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Syphilitic (Luetic) Interstitial Keratitis : Syphilitic interstitial keratitis is associated more frequently (90%) with congenital syphilis than with acquired syphilis. The disease is generally bilateral in inherited syphilis and unilateral in acquired syphilis . In congenital syphilis , manifestations develop between 5 and 15 years of age . Pathogenesis It is now generally accepted that the disease is a manifestation of a local antigen-antibody reaction. The inflammation is usually triggered by an injury or an operation on the eye. Clinical features Interstitial keratitis characteristically forms one of the late manifestations of congenital syphilis . Hutchinson's triad, which includes interstitial keratitis, Hutchinson's teeth and vestibular deafness. The clinical features of interstitial keratitis can be divided into three stages : Initial progressive stage, florid rage and stage of regression. Initial progressive stage . The disease begins with oedema of the endothelium and deeper stroma, secondary to anterior uveitis, as evidenced by the presence of keratic precipitates (KPs). There is associated pain, lacrimation, photophobia, blepharospasm, and circumcorneal injection, followed by a diffuse corneal haze giving it a ground-glass appearance. This stage lasts for about 2 weeks. Florid stage . At this stage, the eye remains acutely inflamed. Deep vascularization of the cornea, consisting of a radial bundle of brush-like vessels, develops. Since these vessels are covered by a hazy cornea, they look dull reddish pink, which is called 'Salmon Patch Appearance'. There is often a moderate degree of superficial vascularization. These vessels, arising from the terminal arches of conjunctival vessels, run a short distance over the cornea. This stage lasts for about 2 months. Stage Of Regression . The acute inflammation resolves with the progressive appearance of vascular invasion. Clearing of cornea is slow and begins from the periphery and advances centrally. Resolution of the lesion leaves behind some opacities and ghost vessels. This stage may last for about 1 or 2 years. Interstitial keratitis: Salmon patch appearance Diagnosis The diagnosis is usually evident from the clinical profile. A positive VDRL or Treponema pallidum immobilization test confirms the diagnosis . Treatment Topical treatment for keratitis and systemic treatment for syphilis. Local Treatment includes: Topical corticosteroid drops, e.g., dexamethasone 0.1% drops every 2-3 hours. As the condition is allergic in origin, corneal clearing occurs with steroids if started well in time and a useful vision is obtained. Atropine eye ointment, 1%, 2- 3 times a day. dark goggles to be used for photophobia. Keratoplasty is required in cases where dense corneal opacities are left Systemic treatment includes: Penicillin in high doses should be stained to prevent the development of further syphilitic lesions. However, early treatment of congenital syphilis usually does not prevent the onset of keratitis at a later stage. Systemic steroids may be added in refractory cases of keratitis .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

Organisms such as Staphylococcus may initially lead to superficial erosions, which coalesce to form frank ulcers. Mode and source of infection: The principal mode of entry of organisms is through the corneal epithelium as a result of a break in the surface, diminished resistance of the epithelium, necrosis, or desquamation . Although minute abrasions of the cornea are probably an everyday occurrence, highly virulent, pathogenic organisms are not usually present in the conjunctival sac, and if they are, the tear film and the resistance of the normal tissues are sufficient to deal with them. However, there are certain specific predisposing factors that increase the risk of developing corneal ulceration. These are the introduction of organisms during trauma, prolonged use of topical steroids, dry eyes, entropion with trichiasis, lagophthalmos due to neuroparalysis (facial nerve), wearing of contact lenses, bullous keratopathy, and poor local hygiene .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A .

It is clinically seen in severe corneal ulcers as a collection of \u2018pus\u2019 in the anterior chamber . Corneal ulcers are associated with some iritis owing to the diffusion of toxins released by bacteria or the invasion of organisms such as fungal hyphae into the eye . The resultant iridocyclitis is severe, leading to the outpouring of leucocytes from the vessels, and these cells gravitate to the bottom of the anterior chamber to form a hypopyon. The development of a hypopyon depends on two factors: (i) the virulence of the infecting organism and (ii) resistance of the tissues. Many pyogenic organisms (staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci,pneumococci, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, etc.) may produce this result, but unless the organism is very virulent, some lack of resistance on the part of the tissues must be present. Hence, hypopyon ulcers are much more common in old, debilitated or alcoholic subjects. It is important to remember that a hypopyon is usually sterile since the leukocytes are due to toxins, not to actual invasion by bacteria, which,indeed, are as incapable of passing through the intact Descemet\u2019s membrane as leukocytes. This accounts for the ease and rapidity with which the Hypopyon is often absorbed. It may develop in an hour or two, rapidly disappear, and then readily reappear. A hypopyon is fluid, always moving to the lowest part of the anterior chamber depending on the position of the patient\u2019s head. It may be so small that it is scarcely visible, being hidden behind the rim of sclera, which overlaps the cornea. It may reach halfway up the iris,having a flat upper surface, determined by gravity, or it may fill the anterior chamber, wholly obscuring the iris. The hypopyon, if fluid, will be seen to shift, i.e., a change in fluid level with tilting or a change in position of the head . A larger hypopyon and that which is due to fungal infections are usually less fluid owing to the fibrinous network, which imprisons the leucocytes in its meshes, and direct invasion by fungal hyphae. These are immobile and are much less readily absorbed. It is usually unnecessary to remove the pus, as is the rule in other parts of the body; if the ulcerative process is controlled, the hypopyon will be absorbed . However, in some cases of recalcitrant fungal ulcers, an anterior chamber tap to test the hypopyon for fungal invasion, followed by an anterior chamber wash with antifungals, may be required.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
