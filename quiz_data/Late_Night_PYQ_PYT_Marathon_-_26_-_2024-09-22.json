This stage is marked by symptoms like vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Following this, the latent phase (Stage II) occurs between 6 to 24 hours, during which GI symptoms may temporarily subside, misleading caregivers into thinking the patient is recovering. However, this is followed by Stage III, which involves shock and metabolic acidosis, occurring between 6 to 72 hours, characterized by severe systemic symptoms such as dehydration, shock, and lactic acidosis. Stage IV, occurring between 12 to 96 hours, involves hepatotoxicity and hepatic necrosis, which can lead to liver failure.

Platelet Count: There may be a slight fall in platelet count during pregnancy, commonly due to gestational thrombocytopenia, which is caused by hemodilution and increased platelet consumption. This condition usually has no adverse effect on pregnancy and is often observed in the third trimester. Coagulation Factors: There is an increase in the plasma levels of several coagulation factors, including factors 1 (fibrinogen), 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Factors 2, 5, and 12 remain unchanged or mildly increased, while factors 11 and 13 are slightly decreased. Clotting Time: Clotting time is generally unaffected by pregnancy.

This bone, along with the hamate, which also begins to ossify around the same time, is among the earliest of the carpal bones visible on radiographs in infants. The ossification of the capitate is used as a marker for bone age in early infancy. The appearance of carpal bones follows a predictable sequence, starting with the capitate and hamate, followed by other bones like the triquetral, lunate, and so forth, with the pisiform being the last to ossify.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 A. Trapezium: The trapezium usually begins ossification around 6 years of age, making it unlikely to be seen on an X-ray of an infant.
