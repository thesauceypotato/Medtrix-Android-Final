      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. A) GM1</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Vibrio cholerae causes cholera, a disease characterized by severe watery diarrhea, often referred to as \"rice water stools.\" The pathogenesis of cholera involves the cholera toxin, which plays a critical role in the disease process.</li><li>\u2022 Upon ingestion of contaminated food or water, Vibrio cholerae produces cholera toxin in the intestinal lumen. The cholera toxin (2 subunits \u2013 A & B) does not enter the intestinal cells directly; instead, it binds to the GM1 ganglioside receptor on the surface of the intestinal epithelial cells. This binding facilitates the entry of the toxin into the cells.</li><li>\u2022 Once inside the cell, the cholera toxin activates the enzyme adenylate cyclase, leading to an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Elevated cAMP levels cause the inhibition of sodium absorption and an increase in chloride and water secretion into the intestinal lumen. This results in the characteristic watery diarrhea of cholera.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.
