Although\n     tremor and postural instability may be less severe, this condition may be\n     difficult to distinguish from Parkinson's disease. Medications\n     that can cause the development of Parkinsonism include: Antipsychotics Metaclopramide Reserpine Tetrabenazine Some\n      calcium channel blockers Stimulants\n      such as amphetamines and cocaine Usually\n      after stopping those medications Parkinsonism gradually disappears</p>\n<p></p>",
