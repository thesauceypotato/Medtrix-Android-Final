D) ML Cu 375</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The ML Cu 375 intrauterine device is known for its very low pregnancy rates, which are typically less than 1 per 100 women years. This exceptionally low rate is due to the device's efficient design and larger copper surface area, which enhances its contraceptive efficacy. The categorization of IUDs based on pregnancy rates places ML Cu 375 in the highest efficacy group.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
