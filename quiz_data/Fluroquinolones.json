Side effects are skin rashes, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, dizziness & rise in serum amino-transferases. It can enhance the warfarin effect & carries the risk of additive q-t prolongation with other drugs. Option: C . Gatifloxacin causes deglycation. Hence it is not used nowadays and has been withdrawn. Option: D. Ciprofloxacin causes: Git: nausea, vomiting, bad taste, anorexia. Because gut anaerobes are not affected\u2014diarrhoea is infrequent. Cns: dizziness, headache, restlessness, anxiety, insomnia, impairment of concentration & dexterity (caution while driving). Tremors & seizures are rare and occur only at high doses/ when predisposing factors are present. Skin/hypersensitivity: rash, pruritus, photosensitivity, urticaria, swelling of lips, etc. Tendonitis & tendon rupture: risk of tendon damage is higher in patients above 60 years of age & in those receiving corticosteroids. Due to reports of cartilage damage, fqs should be used cautiously in children. Ciprofloxacin & other fqs are contraindicated during pregnancy.</p>\n<p></p>",
