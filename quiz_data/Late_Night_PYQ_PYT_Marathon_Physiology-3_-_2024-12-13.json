      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. D) Reduction in surface tension</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Surfactant plays a critical role in the lungs by reducing the surface tension at the air-liquid interface within the alveoli. This reduction in surface tension is vital to prevent the collapse of the alveoli, particularly during the exhalation phase of breathing. Surfactant achieves this by disrupting the cohesive forces between water molecules lining the alveoli, which are primarily responsible for the high surface tension. The most important component of surfactant, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPCC), helps stabilize the alveoli and keeps them open throughout the breathing cycle, facilitating gas exchange and maintaining proper lung function.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Increases O2 diffusion : Incorrect, as surfactant does not directly affect oxygen diffusion; it primarily influences mechanical properties of the lungs.</li><li>\u2022 Option</li><li>\u2022 A.

Decreases airway resistance</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Prevents overexpansion of the lung : Incorrect, the primary role of surfactant is not to prevent overexpansion but to reduce the energy required to expand the lungs and prevent alveolar collapse.</li><li>\u2022 Option</li><li>\u2022 C. Prevents overexpansion of the lung</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The essential function of surfactant is to reduce the surface tension within the alveoli, preventing their collapse and ensuring efficient lung operation, especially in the prevention of conditions like Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome in premature infants.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

D) Both B and C</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), also known as the hexose monophosphate shunt, plays a critical role in cellular metabolism by generating NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate. NADPH is crucial for reductive biosynthesis reactions, such as fatty acid and nucleotide synthesis, and for maintaining reduced glutathione levels to protect against oxidative stress. Ribose-5-phosphate is essential for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis. The PPP occurs in the cytosol and consists of two phases: the oxidative phase, which produces NADPH, and the non-oxidative phase, which generates ribose precursors.

Surface tension - increased; Compliance - decreased</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 This preterm baby who developed respiratory distress syndrome has surfactant deficiency. Due to which surface tension increases and compliance decreases.</li><li>\u2022 Surfactant (Lecithin/Dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl Choline) is produced by specialized cells called type II alveolar cells in the lungs. Surfactant molecules have a hydrophilic (water-attracting) head and a hydrophobic (water-repellent) tail. This unique structure allows surfactant to lower the surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the alveoli. It reduces the attractive forces between water molecules, preventing the alveoli from collapsing during expiration.</li><li>\u2022 Compliance refers to the ability of the lungs to expand and recoil efficiently during breathing. Without surfactant, the surface tension within the alveoli would be high, making it difficult for the lungs to inflate during inspiration and causing them to collapse more readily during expiration.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective</li><li>\u27a4 In preterm infants, especially those born before the lungs have matured at around 28 weeks, the lack of adequate surfactant leads to increased surface tension and decreased compliance, contributing to the development of respiratory distress syndrome.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

When a hormone binds to its receptor, the associated heterotrimeric G protein undergoes a conformational change. This change leads to the exchange of GDP for GTP on the G protein's alpha subunit, causing it to dissociate from the beta and gamma subunits.</li><li>\u2022 The activated GTP-bound alpha subunit then interacts with adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme located on the inner membrane of the cell. Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP). The newly formed cAMP acts as a secondary messenger that activates Protein Kinase A (PKA). PKA, in turn, phosphorylates various target proteins, leading to a cascade of cellular responses.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The correct sequence in the G protein-coupled receptor pathway is: Adenylyl cyclase activates the conversion of ATP to cAMP, which then activates Protein Kinase A (PKA).</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Becomes more positive</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 In the given clinical scenario, the patient has hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can cause a shift in the resting membrane potential towards a more positive value, increased cell excitability, and impairments in membrane potential changes.</li><li>\u2022 Hyperkalemia can affect the resting membrane potential of cells, including neurons and muscle cells, in the following ways:</li><li>\u2022 Increased Resting Membrane Potential: Normally, the resting membrane potential is around -70 millivolts (mV) in neurons. However, in hyperkalemia, the elevated extracellular potassium concentration can lead to an increased positive charge outside the cell. This positive charge tends to depolarize the cell membrane, shifting the resting membrane potential towards a more positive value. Altered Excitability: The increased resting membrane potential caused by hyperkalemia can make the cell more excitable. It reduces the threshold required for an action potential to be initiated, making the cell more likely to depolarize and generate an action potential even in response to weaker stimuli. Impaired Membrane Potential Changes: Hyperkalemia can interfere with the ability of the cell membrane to depolarize and repolarize properly during an action potential. It reduces the electrochemical gradient for sodium (Na+) entry during depolarization and decreases the driving force for potassium (K+) exit during repolarization. This can result in slower and less efficient propagation of action potentials. Disrupted Ionic Balance: Elevated potassium levels can disrupt the balance of other ions, such as sodium and calcium, which are essential for normal cell function. The altered ionic balance can interfere with the proper functioning of ion channels and other membrane proteins involved in generating and regulating action potentials.</li><li>\u2022 Increased Resting Membrane Potential: Normally, the resting membrane potential is around -70 millivolts (mV) in neurons.
