      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Physostigmine Belladonna poisoning is due to the consumption of plant Atropa Belladonna plant. Its active constituent is mainly atropine and other anticholinergic substances. Physostigmine is an indirectly acting parasympathomimetic drug that acts by increasing Acetylcholine by blocking the Acetylcholinesterase enzyme. Thus it reverses the action of the muscarinic receptor blockade by atropine in belladonna poisoning. Physostigmine- 0.5\u20132 mg i.v. Repeated as required is the specific antidote for poisoning with belladonna or other anticholinergics It penetrates the blood-brain barrier and antagonizes both central and peripheral actions Neostigmine and pyridostigmine don\u2019t cross BBB Atropine is also called belladonna</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Indirectly acting parasympathomimetic drugs, acting by Ach esterase inhibition.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Atropine These are the characteristic features of anticholinergic overdose. Anticholinergics inhibit cholinergic responses and produce a state that can be remembered by the mnemonics given below.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Symptoms of organophosphates are pinpoint pupil, salivation, lacrimation, sweating, bronchoconstriction, diarrhea, urination, bradycardia, and coma. Option  C . Mushroom poisoning (Mycetism). Early mushroom poisoning is due to Inocybe and Clitocybe species. Symptoms manifest within thirty minutes and are of cholinergic excess (like diarrhea, lacrimation, bradycardia, etc.) Therefore, the drug of choice is atropine. Amanita muscaria poisoning does not manifest as cholinergic excess (because muscarine content is too low to produce symptoms), rather, the symptoms produced are due to other contents like muscimol, ibotenic acid, and other isoxazole derivatives. These agents stimulate excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Therefore, symptoms range from irritability, restlessness, ataxia, hallucinations and delirium to drowsiness and sedation. Treatment is mainly supportive; benzodiazepines are indicated when excitation predominates, whereas atropine is contra-indicated because it may exacerbate delirium. Delayed mushroom poisoning is due to Amanita phalloides and Galerina species. Principal toxins are amatoxins which act by inhibiting mRNA synthesis. Renal and hepatic dysfunction results. Treatment is largely supportive and penicillin, thioctic acid and silibinin may be effective antidotes. Option. D N-acetylcysteine is used for paracetamol poisoning whereas slow intravenous infusion and chloride dieresis along with amifostine can limit cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Mnemonic\nfor atropine poisoning i.
