      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Madurella mycetomatis Mycetoma is a localized chronic infection caused by various species of fungi or actinomycetes and characterized by the formation of aggregates of the causative organisms (grains) within abscesses. Grains are discharged to the surface through draining sinuses. Mycetoma may be caused by various species of fungi (Eumycetoma) and aerobic actinomycetes(Actinomycetoma). The most common aetiological agents are Madurella mycetomatis , Fusarium , Madurella grisea ,Actinomadura madurae , Nocardia brasiliensis and Nocardia asteroides. Trauma is the inciting event for the entry of microorganism . The earliest stage is a firm , painless nodule which progresses to firm, painless papules and pustules which break down to form sinuses discharging granules. A tentative diagnosis sufficient to initiate treatment may be made on the basis of grain colour, texture and direct microscopy. Radiographs may show destructive changes in the underlying bone. Causative species can often be suggested by the color of the characteristic grains and hyphal size within the infected tissues but definitive diagnosis requires culture. Dapsone with streptomycin or rifampicin OR Co-trimoxazole+ Streptomycin or Rifampicin is the first line of treatment . (Actinomycetoma -Modified welsh regimen is used) For Eumycotic mycetoma various etiologic agents may respond differently to antifungal agents, so culture results are invaluable.(Itraconazole can be used) Amputation is necessary in far advanced cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Diagnosis of organisms causing mycetoma based on colour of grains: Colour  of grains Organism Madurella mycetomatis Black to brown Madurella Grisea Black to brown Actinomadura madurae White Nocardia asteroides White Nocardia brasiliensis White</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Differences between Eumycetoma and Actinomycetoma: Feature Eumycetoma Actinomycetoma Etiological agent Fungus Bacteria Site Extremities , most commonly foot Most commonly on foot trunk and head involvement may be seen Progression Slow , less inflammatory and less destructive Rapid , diffuse ,more inflammatory and more destructive Sinuses Few Many Grains Black Pale yellow to white , red grains may be seen.

The nails are lusterless, brittle, and hypertrophic, and the substance of the nail is friable. Portions of the nail should be clipped, digested with 10% KOH, and examined under the microscope for hyphae. Fungi may also be cultured from debris collected from underneath the nail plate. Periodic acid-Schiff stain of a histologic section of the nail plate will also demonstrate the fungus readily. Treatment: First line: Oral Terbinafine 250 mg /day for 6 weeks for finger nails , for 3 months for toe nails. Or Itraconazole 400 mg /day for 1 week , monthly for 2-3 months for fingernails , for 3-4 months for toe nails .
