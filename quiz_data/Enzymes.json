In negative feedback allosteric regulation, the end product of a metabolic pathway inhibits an enzyme at an earlier step in the pathway, effectively shutting down production when sufficient product has accumulated. Classic examples include:</li><li>\u2022 Inhibition of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) by ATP in glycolysis Inhibition of aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) by CTP in pyrimidine synthesis</li><li>\u2022 Inhibition of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) by ATP in glycolysis</li><li>\u2022 Inhibition of aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) by CTP in pyrimidine synthesis</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Allosteric effectors bind allosteric enzymes at their active sites : This statement is incorrect. By definition, allosteric effectors bind to sites distinct from the active site, called allosteric sites. The term \"allosteric\" comes from \"allo\" (other) and \"steric\" (space or structure), referring to binding at a site other than the active site. When an allosteric effector binds, it induces a conformational change that alters the activity of the enzyme.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Allosteric effectors bind allosteric enzymes at their active sites</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Allosteric enzymes possess secondary structure : This statement is correct but not distinctive. All proteins, including enzymes (allosteric or not), possess secondary structure elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets. This is not a unique characteristic of allosteric enzymes.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Allosteric enzymes possess secondary structure</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Allosteric control is irreversible : This is incorrect. Allosteric regulation is typically reversible, allowing for rapid adaptation to changing cellular conditions.

Their activity can be modulated by effectors binding at sites distinct from the active site, causing conformational changes that alter the enzyme's catalytic efficiency. This provides a rapid, reversible mechanism for regulating metabolic pathways in response to changing cellular needs, with negative feedback being one of the most common control mechanisms in metabolism.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: DM Vasudevan 9/e: p 62.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: DM Vasudevan 9/e: p 62.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
