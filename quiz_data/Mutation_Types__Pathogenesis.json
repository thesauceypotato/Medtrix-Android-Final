He is above normal height and weight for his age. Physical examination shows small testes and gynecomastia. His parents report that he had to repeat the 8th and 9th grades and still struggles in his classes. This patient's condition is most likely related to which of the following genetic abnormalities?",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Nondisjunction of a sex chromosome The correct answer is C. The boy probably has Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) , which has the typical presentation described in the question. Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome is the most common congenital abnormality causing primary hypogonadism and occurs in approximately 1 in 1000 live births. The diagnosis is commonly made during adolescence or adulthood in males with small testes with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and gynecomastia . Two common symptoms leading to the diagnosis include infertility and gynecomastia. Other symptoms include fatigue, erectile dysfunction, language impairment, academic difficulty, subnormal libido, osteoporosis, and behavioural problems . Karyotype for a person with Klinefelters :</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Genomic imprinting: Preferential expression of genes from either parent. In Prader-Willi syndrome , deletion of band q12 on the long arm of paternal chromosome 15 Genes in this region of maternal chromosome 15 are imprinted, so their functions are entirely lost. Patients have mental retardation, short stature, hypotonia, hyperphagia, small hands and feet, and hypogonadism . In Angelman syndrome, the same region is deleted from the maternal chromosome . Since genes on the corresponding part of paternal chromosome 15 are imprinted, these patients have mental retardation, ataxia, seizures, and inappropriate laughter .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Deletion of a gene. E.g., Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, both of which occur on the q arm of chromosome 15 . Both conditions can present with intellectual disability. Prader-Willi syndrome can exhibit uncontrollable appetite and increased weight , whereas Angelman syndrome would exhibit ataxia with constant smiling and laughing (\"happy puppet\") . Option: B. Nondisjunction of an autosomal chromosome. Examples of nondisjunction of autosomes include trisomies, such as most cases of Down syndrome (trisomy 21) , Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) , and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13) . Option: D. Reciprocal translocation. Reciprocal translocations result when two non-homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Disomy of maternal chromosome is because of the following: Deletion of Paternal chromosomes . Disomy of Paternal chromosomes . Angelman syndrome is because of the following: Deletion of Maternal chromosomes . Disomy of Paternal chromosomes .</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Isochromosome Isochromosome formation results when one arm of a chromosome is lost and the remaining arm is duplicated , resulting in a chromosome consisting of only two short arms or two long arms . An Isochromosome has morphologically identical genetic information in both arms . The most common isochromosome present in live births involves the long arm of the X and is designated i(X)(q10).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Epigenetics: Epigenetics is the study of heritable chemical modification of DNA or chromatin that does NOT alter the DNA sequence itself . Examples of such modification include the methylation of DNA and the methylation and acetylation of histones . Epigenetic modifications are critical for normal human development , including the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression , X chromosome inactivation , and imprinting , as well as for understanding the cellular perturbations in aging and cancer. Gene expression frequently correlates negatively with the level of methylation of DNA . Methylation analysis is also essential in diagnosing Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. MNEMONIC: M ethylation M utes</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Ring chromosome. A ring chromosome is a special form of deletion . It is produced when a break occurs at both ends of a chromosome with fusion of the damaged ends . If significant genetic material is lost, phenotypic abnormalities result. Option: C. Inversis a rearrangement involving two breaks within a single chromosome with reincorporation of the inverted, intervening segment . An inversion involving only one arm of the chromosome is known as paracentric . If the breaks are on opposite sides of the centromere, it is known as pericentric . Option: D. Deletion refers to the loss of a portion of a chromosome . Most deletions are interstitial, but rarely terminal deletions may occur. Interstitial deletions occur when there are two breaks within a chromosome arm, followed by loss of the chromosomal material between the breaks and fusion of the broken ends.</p>\n<p></p>",
