When babies are large for their gestational age, this classifies the pregnancies as high-risk Fetal macrosomia can occur due to maternal obesity or gestational diabetes. along with several other untreated maternal health conditions. The key to preventing macrosomia is proper health screening of the mother. It's imperative that macrosomia is diagnosed prenatally so that the timing and management of delivery can be planned. C-section should be considered to avoid trauma to the baby. Measurement tools such as ultrasounds, fundal height, amniotic fluid levels, and Leopold maneuvers should be used to determine whether the baby will be of an excessively large size. The most accurate tests for estimating fetal weight (ultrasound) should be used</p>\n<p></p>",
