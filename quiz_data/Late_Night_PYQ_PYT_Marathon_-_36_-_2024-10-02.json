The bacteria remain localized at the site of infection (e.g., the throat), but the toxin spreads systemically.

It presents as painful, superficial ulcers with irregular, soft margins and a friable base that often bleeds easily. The ulcers are accompanied by regional lymphadenopathy, which may progress to suppuration if untreated. The characteristic appearance of Haemophilus ducreyi on Gram stain, often described as a \"school of fish\" or \"railroad track\" pattern, helps in diagnosis.

Ultrasound guidance can enhance the accuracy of the procedure by allowing direct visualization of the abscess, ensuring that the needle is correctly positioned to access the abscess cavity.

Incision and Drainage: Incision and drainage is generally considered if aspiration fails repeatedly or if the abscess is too large. While effective, it is not typically the immediate next step after a single failed aspiration attempt. It is more invasive than aspiration and usually reserved for cases where less invasive methods are unsuccessful.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Incision and Drainage:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Continue antibiotics only: Antibiotics are crucial in managing breast abscesses by treating the underlying infection. However, they alone might not suffice for large or dense abscesses. The pus trapped within the abscess often needs to be physically removed to expedite healing and provide symptom relief. Continuing antibiotics without addressing the abscess can lead to prolonged infection and discomfort.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Continue antibiotics only:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Stop antibiotics as no aspirate was collected: This option is not recommended. The failure to collect aspirate does not imply the absence of infection. The antibiotics were prescribed based on the clinical diagnosis of a breast abscess, and stopping them prematurely could allow the infection to worsen. Continuation of antibiotics is important until the course is complete or unless indicated otherwise by a physician.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Leishmaniasis is caused by protozoan parasites transmitted through the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. The rK39 antigen test is a rapid and highly specific immunochromatographic test that detects anti-k39 antibodies, which are secreted in various body fluids, including blood, and is widely used for diagnosing VL.
