This deficiency leads to the accumulation of toxic substances such as galactose-1-phosphate in the liver, brain, and other organs, resulting in hypoglycemia, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and potential mental retardation if untreated. The positive Benedict\u2019s test, jaundice, and refusal of lactose-containing feeds are hallmark findings of this condition.

LPL is essential for the hydrolysis of triglycerides present in chylomicrons into free fatty acids, which can be used for energy or stored in tissues. When LPL is deficient or non-functional, chylomicrons are not adequately broken down and thus accumulate in the bloodstream, causing hypertriglyceridemia, abdominal pain, and a higher risk of pancreatitis. This accumulation is especially noticeable after eating foods rich in fats, as chylomicrons are responsible for the transport of dietary triglycerides.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 A. Apolipoprotein B: Apolipoprotein B is a component of VLDL, LDL, and chylomicrons, but its levels do not specifically indicate LPL deficiency.

This unique structure is a hallmark of acrocentric chromosomes, which include chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 in humans.
