B) B</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The given question involves hypoxia and hypercapnia with a slightly acidic pH of 7.35. The graph represents the relationship between alveolar PCO\u2082 and ventilation rate. In conditions of both hypoxia (low oxygen) and hypercapnia (high CO\u2082), the body responds by increasing ventilation to compensate for decreased oxygen and rising CO\u2082 levels.</li><li>\u2022 Option B represents a moderate increase in ventilation, which is characteristic of the body's response to combined hypoxia and hypercapnia.

Understanding how various substances are reabsorbed or secreted is key to identifying them on the graph.</li><li>\u2022 Analysis of Graph:</li><li>\u2022 Analysis of Graph:</li><li>\u2022 Curve A - Glucose (Completely Reabsorbed) The curve representing substance A shows a rapid decline to nearly 0% early in the nephron. This is characteristic of glucose , which is actively reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) via SGLT (sodium-glucose transporters) and GLUT transporters. Under normal physiological conditions, glucose is fully reabsorbed , provided the renal threshold is not exceeded (as in diabetes mellitus). Curve B - Bicarbonate (Mostly Reabsorbed) Bicarbonate (HCO\u2083\u207b) is also heavily reabsorbed , but not as rapidly as glucose. The proximal tubule reabsorbs around 85% of bicarbonate, and the remaining portion is fine-tuned by the collecting duct. Unlike glucose, a small fraction of bicarbonate may be lost in the urine, explaining why substance B is not reabsorbed as quickly or completely as glucose . Curve C - Inulin (Freely Filtered, Not Reabsorbed or Secreted) Inulin is a substance that is freely filtered at the glomerulus and neither reabsorbed nor secreted. This results in a flat line on the graph ( Curve C ), indicating that its concentration in the filtrate remains constant as it passes through the nephron . Because inulin is only cleared by filtration , it is used to measure glomerular filtration rate (GFR) . Curve D - PAH (Para-Aminohippuric Acid, Secreted) PAH is both filtered and actively secreted in the proximal tubule, resulting in an increase in its concentration along the nephron. This accounts for the rising curve (Curve D) as more PAH is secreted into the tubule. PAH is almost completely cleared from the plasma in a single pass through the kidney, making it useful for measuring renal plasma flow (RPF) .</li><li>\u2022 Curve A - Glucose (Completely Reabsorbed) The curve representing substance A shows a rapid decline to nearly 0% early in the nephron.

This phase occurs after repolarization and is due to the slow closure of voltage-gated K\u207a channels , leading to continued K\u207a efflux (outward movement of potassium ions).</li><li>\u2022 marked region (4 to 5)</li><li>\u2022 hyperpolarization phase</li><li>\u2022 neuronal action potential</li><li>\u2022 after repolarization</li><li>\u2022 slow closure of voltage-gated K\u207a channels</li><li>\u2022 K\u207a efflux</li><li>\u2022 Depolarization (Phase 1 - Na\u207a Influx) Voltage-gated Na\u207a channels open , allowing Na\u207a influx , making the inside of the neuron more positive. Repolarization (Phase 2 - K\u207a Efflux) After reaching the peak, Na\u207a channels close , and voltage-gated K\u207a channels open , causing K\u207a efflux (outward movement of K\u207a), restoring negativity inside the neuron. Hyperpolarization (Phase 3 - Slow K\u207a Efflux - Marked 4 to 5 in the Graph) The K\u207a channels are slow to close (\"Kachua/Tortoise channels\") , causing excess K\u207a efflux , making the membrane potential more negative than resting potential (-70 mV) .
