A) 1% Atropine</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 1% Atropine is the preferred drug for refraction in a child (<7 yr children) with squint, particularly because it is the strongest cycloplegic agent available.</li><li>\u2022 Children often have strong accommodation, which can interfere with accurate refraction, especially in cases of accommodative esotropia. Using a potent cycloplegic like 1% atropine helps to fully relax the accommodation, allowing for precise measurement of refractive errors.</li><li>\u2022 Atropine 1% is typically preferred in ointment form due to its longer duration of action and ease of application. The ointment can be applied to the eyelashes or lower lid, ensuring widespread coverage over the entire eye surface. This is especially useful for children under the age of 7 who require thorough cycloplegia for accurate refraction.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.
