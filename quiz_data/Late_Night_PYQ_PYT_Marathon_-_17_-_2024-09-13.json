D) 1, 2, and 4</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 Ventricular muscle fibers exhibit several unique properties that are crucial for their function:</li><li>\u2022 1. All or None Law : This principle states that a single muscle fiber will either contract fully or not at all in response to a stimulus. Ventricular muscle fibers act as a syncytium due to the presence of gap junctions made up of connexin proteins, which allows them to follow the all-or-none law. Thus, this property is true for ventricular muscle fibers.</li><li>\u2022 1. All or None Law</li><li>\u2022 2. Length-Tension Relation : The length-tension relationship in ventricular muscle fibers is a reflection of the Frank-Starling law, which states that the force of contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to its initial length (or end-diastolic volume, EDV). This relationship is crucial for adjusting cardiac output based on the volume of blood returning to the heart. Within physiological limits, an increase in the initial length of the muscle fiber increases the force of contraction.</li><li>\u2022 2. Length-Tension Relation</li><li>\u2022 4. Long Refractory Period : Ventricular muscle fibers have a long refractory period due to the extended plateau phase in their action potential. This long refractory period is crucial in preventing tetanus and ensuring that the heart muscle relaxes fully before the next contraction, maintaining efficient pumping action.</li><li>\u2022 4. Long Refractory Period</li><li>\u2022 Other Option:</li><li>\u2022 Other Option:</li><li>\u2022 3. Tetanus : Tetanus is a sustained muscle contraction that occurs when the muscle is stimulated at a high frequency. However, due to the long refractory period in ventricular muscle fibers, tetanus is not possible. The plateau phase (phase 2) of the cardiac action potential is prolonged, which ensures that the heart muscle cannot be re-stimulated before the previous contraction is complete. This prevents sustained contractions (tetanus), which would be detrimental to cardiac function.</li><li>\u2022 3. Tetanus</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Ventricular muscle fibers follow the all-or-none law, have a length-tension relationship (Frank-Starling law), and possess a long refractory period that prevents tetanus.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Decreased arterial compliance, often due to aging or atherosclerosis, results in stiffer arteries that are less able to expand during systole. This reduced elasticity leads to a disproportionate rise in systolic pressure compared to diastolic pressure, causing an increased pulse pressure. As the arteries lose their ability to stretch and buffer the pressure changes, systolic pressure rises, contributing significantly to the elevated pulse pressure seen in this patient.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Cardiac contractility Increased cardiac contractility elevates stroke volume and can transiently raise systolic pressure; however, it does not specifically alter arterial compliance.

Segment II is due to Laplace Law</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The true statement regarding the given cystometrogram is that segment lb is due to Laplace law.</li><li>\u2022 The law of Laplace correlates volume and wall tension, is applicable to urine storage.</li><li>\u2022 According to Law of Laplace, the pressure (P) in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension (T) divided by the radius (R). This is expressed as P= 2T/R.</li><li>\u2022 As the bladder gets filled, the radius increases along with the tension, hence there is a slight increase in pressure until the bladder is relatively full, which explains the flatness of the graph in segment II</li><li>\u2022 The first urge to void is felt at a bladder volume of about 150 mL. A marked sense of fullness is felt at a bladder volume of 400ml.</li><li>\u2022 Cystometrogram is a plot of intravesical pressure against the volume of fluid in the bladder. The curve shows three segments:</li><li>\u2022 Initial Filling Phase (or Low-Pressure Phase ): This phase represents the storage phase of bladder function. Rapid Filling Phase (or High-Pressure Phase): In this phase, the intravesical pressure increases more rapidly as the bladder volume reaches a certain threshold. The detrusor muscle, which contracts to initiate bladder emptying, starts to generate increased pressure as the bladder approaches its capacity. This phase represents the transition from storage to voiding phase. Voiding Phase (or Micturition Phase): In the voiding phase, the intravesical pressure rises to its highest level as the detrusor muscle contracts forcefully to empty the bladder. The pressure exceeds the urethral resistance, resulting in urine expulsion. This phase is associated with the sensation of needing to urinate and the act of micturition (urination).</li><li>\u2022 Initial Filling Phase (or Low-Pressure Phase ): This phase represents the storage phase of bladder function.</li><li>\u2022 Initial Filling Phase (or Low-Pressure Phase</li><li>\u2022 Rapid Filling Phase (or High-Pressure Phase): In this phase, the intravesical pressure increases more rapidly as the bladder volume reaches a certain threshold.

Segment Ia is due to residual urine</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Micturition fails to happen in segment II : Incorrect. Segment II represents the continuation of the filling phase; micturition (urination) does not occur here because it typically begins when the bladder reaches its threshold capacity and the detrusor muscle contracts, which would be represented later in the graph.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Micturition fails to happen in segment II</li><li>\u2022 Option D. The dotted line represents that micturition has occurred : Incorrect. The dotted line likely indicates phase transitions within the bladder's filling and voiding cycle, not necessarily the occurrence of micturition.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

This mechanism, located primarily in the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn, inhibits the transmission of pain signals carried by smaller nociceptive fibers like A-delta and C fibers. The activation of these large fibers \"closes the gate\" to pain, reducing the perception of pain. This modulation of pain signals through the spinal cord's gate control system is a key component of TENS therapy, contributing to its analgesic effect.</li><li>\u2022 .</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

It increases local blood flow to painful areas, providing muscle relaxation and pain relief.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. It stimulates the release of endorphins at the site of stimulation, providing local analgesia.

It stimulates the release of endorphins at the site of stimulation, providing local analgesia.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. It disrupts the transmission of pain signals by depolarizing nociceptive neurons directly. TENS does not directly depolarize nociceptive neurons; instead, it works by modulating spinal cord circuits and descending inhibitory pathways to reduce pain transmission through indirect mechanisms.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
