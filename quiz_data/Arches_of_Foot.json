Medial longitudinal arch Medial Longitudinal Arch: This arch is considerably higher, more mobile, and more resilient than the lateral. It is considered as a big arc of a small circle. Its constitution is as follows: Ends : The anterior end is formed by the heads of the first, second, and third metatarsals. The phalanges do not take part in forming the arches. The posterior end of this arch is formed by the medial tubercle of the calcaneum. Summit The summit of the arch is formed by the superior articular surface of the body of the talus. Pillars The anterior pillar is long and weak. It is formed by the talus, the navicular, the three cuneiform bones, and the first three metatarsal bones . The posterior pillar is short and strong. It is formed by the medial part of the calcaneum. The main joint of the arch is the talocalcaneonavicular joint.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. b, a, and d Option: B . c, b, and d Option: D. All of above Option A, B, and D are incorrect because Cuboid bone contributes to the formation of the lateral longitudinal arch. Lateral longitudinal arch The lateral longitudinal arch is a much less pronounced arch than the medial one. The bones making up the lateral longitudinal arch are the calcaneus, the cuboid, and the fourth and fifth metatarsals; they contribute little to the arch in terms of stability.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is considered as a small arc of a big circle. This is in contrast to the medial longitudinal arch which acts as a shock absorber. The constitution of the lateral longitudinal arch is as follows. Ends The anterior end of the arch is formed by the heads of the 4th and 5th metatarsal bones. The posterior end is formed by the lateral tubercle of the calcaneum.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All are true statements Option: A. Shape of the bones concerned. Bony Factor : The posterior transverse arch is formed, and maintained mainly because of the fact that many of the tarsal bones involved (e.g., the cuneiform bones), and the heads of the metatarsal bones, are wedge-shaped, the apex of the wedge pointing downwards. Option: B. Intersegmental ties/staples or ligaments (and muscles) Intersegmental Ties : All arches are supported by the ligaments uniting the bones concerned. The most important of these are as follows: The spring ligament for the medial longitudinal arch. The long and short plantar ligaments for the lateral longitudinal arch. In the case of the transverse arch , the metatarsal bones are held together by the interosseous muscles also. Option: C. Tie beams or bow strings that connect the two ends of the arch. Tie Beams : The longitudinal arches are prevented from flattening by the plantar aponeurosis, and by the muscles of the first layer of the sole. These structures keep the anterior and posterior ends of these arches pulled together. In the case of the transverse arch, the adductor hallucis acts as a tie beam. Slings: The summit of the medial longitudinal arch is pulled upwards by tendons passing from the posterior compartment of the leg into the sole, i.e., tibialis posterior, flexor hallucis longus, flexor digitorum longus. The summit of the lateral longitudinal arch is pulled upwards by the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis. The tendons of tibialis anterior and peroneus longus together form a sling (stirrup) which keeps the middle of the foot pulled upwards, thus supporting the longitudinal arches. As the tendon of the peroneus longus runs transversely across the sole , it pulls the medial and lateral margins of the sole closer together, thus maintaining the transverse arches. The transverse arch is also supported by tibialis posterior which grips many of the bones of the sole through its slips.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>' Suspension: Medial longitudinal arch- Tibialis anterior Lateral longitudinal arch - Peroneus longus. Therefore all options are correct, so option D. All true statements are correct answers.</p>\n<p></p>",

FUNCTIONS OF ARCHES The arches of the foot distribute body weight to the weight-bearing areas of the sole, mainly the heel and the toes. Out of the latter, the weight is borne mainly on the first and fifth toes. The lateral border of the foot bears some weight, but this is reduced due to the presence of the lateral longitudinal arch. The arches act as springs (chiefly the medial longitudinal arch) which are of great help in walking and running. Option: B. Arches of the foot also act as shock absorbers in stepping and particularly in jumping. Option: C. The concavity of the arches protects the soft tissues of the sole against pressure. The character of the medial longitudinal arch is resiliency and that of the lateral longitudinal arch is rigidit Therefore Option D: All are correct is the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Lateral longitudinal Arch support</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All of the above When the feet do not show upward concavity along the medial border of the foot, the foot is called a \"flat foot\". If such a person puts his wet feet on the ground, there will be an impression of the whole foot. Flat-foot persons cannot run as fast as arched-foot The police persons are required to run fast, so a flat-foot person may be disqualified. Flat Foot Absence or collapse of the arches leads to flat-foot (pes planus), which may be congenital or acquired. The effects of a flat foot are as follows. Option: A. Loss of spring in the foot leads to a clumsy, shuffling gait. Option: B. Loss of shock-absorbing function makes the foot more liable to trauma and osteoarthritis. Option: C. Loss of the concavity of the sole leads to compression of the nerves and vessels of the sole. Compression of the communication between the lateral and medial plantar nerves causes neuralgic pain in the forefoot (metatarsalgia). Compression of blood vessels may cause vascular disturbances in the toes.</p>\n<p></p>",
