      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dorsal nasal artery and angular artery Facial part of the facial artery gives 4 branches while ascending through the face. They are inferior labial artery, superior labial artery, lateral nasal artery and angular artery. Angular artery is not an end artery . It ascends up to the medial angle of the eye, where it anastomoses with the dorsal nasal artery. Dorsal nasal artery is a branch of ophthalmic artery , which in turn is a branch of internal carotid artery. So, this anastomosis at the medial angle of the eye is between the branches of the external carotid artery and internal carotid artery. The other piles of anastomoses between external and internal carotid arteries include superior orbital artery(ICA) and superficial temporal artery(ECA); ophthalmic artery(ICA) and middle meningeal artery(ECA); dorsal nasal artery(ICA) and nasal branches of facial artery(ECA); anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries(ICA) and sphenopalatine artery(ECA) etc. The superior labial artery and superficial temporal artery are not located at the medial angle of the eye. Hence, cannot be involved in bleeding from these sites.</p>\n<p></p>",

This physical pressure can potentially move infectious agents from the pimple into the ophthalmic vein, which then carries it to the cavernous sinus. The pterygoid venous plexus and ophthalmic vein communicate with the cavernous sinus and therefore offer a route of travel for the spread of infection. Still, the path provided by the superior ophthalmic vein is a more direct route. Additionally, the superior ophthalmic vein receives blood supply from the supraorbital, supratrochlear, and angular veins that supply The area around the nose and lower forehead.
