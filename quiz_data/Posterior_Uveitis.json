Subtenon injection of triamcinolone is highly effective in leading to resolution without recurrence of ocular symptoms monotherapy sub-tenon injection of steroids is ideal, specifically for patients already on systemic Immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) or who have minimal systemic symptoms of their disease Systemic Immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) : Cyclosporine has shown improved efficacy in cases of chronic uveitis VKH. Methotrexate has shown good efficacy in studies combining methotrexate with fluocinolone intravitreal implants, while infliximab shows promise in pediatric populations. Adalimumab has most recently been studied in recalcitrant cases of patients with corticosteroid-related complications and challenging pediatric cases.

Since the outer layers of the retina are in close contact with the choroid and also depend on it for nourishment, the choroidal inflammation almost always involves the adjoining retina, and the resultant lesion is called chorioretinitis . Etiology and Pathology Common causes of posterior uveitis (chorioretinitis) are summarised below: Infectious Virus : CMY, HSV, Herpes zoster, rubella, rubeola (measles) Bacteria : TB, Brucellosis, Lyme's disease, Hematogenously spread gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria Fungi : Candida, Histoplasma, blastomycosis, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus Parasite : Toxoplasma, toxocara, cysticercus, onchocerca. Non-infectious Autoimmune : Behcet's disease (HLA-B5), VogtKoyanagi- Harada syndrome, SLE, Wegener's granulomatosis, sympathetic ophthalmia Malignancy : intraocular lymphoma, malignant melanoma, leukemia Unknown etiology : Sarcoidosis, serpiginous choroiditis, Birdshot chorioretinopathy, retinal pigment epitheliopathy. Causes of Intermediate uveitis (Pars planitis) Idiopathic. In most cases etiology is unknown. Known causes are TB, syphilis, Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, and multiple sclerosi Clinical features Symptoms Choroiditis (non-suppurative inflammation) is a painless condition with no photophobia, lacrimation, or circumcorneal congestion. It is usually characterized by visual symptoms due to associated vitreous haze and involvement of the retina. Therefore, small patches situated in the periphery may be symptomless and are usually discovered as healed patches on routine fundus examination. On the contrary, a central patch produces marked symptoms which draw immediate attention. Defective vision. It is a subjective sensation of flashes of light resulting due to irritation of rods and cones. Black spots floating in front of the eyes . It is a very common complaint of such patients. They occur due to large exudative clumps in the vitreous. Metamorphopsia . Here, patients perceive distorted images of the object. This results due to an alteration in the retinal contour caused by a raised patch of choroiditis. Micropsia which results due to separation of visual cells is a common complaint. In this, the objects appear smaller than they are. Macropsia, i.e. perception of the objects larger than they are , may occur due to the crowding together of rods and cones. Positive scotoma, i.e. perception of a fixed large spot in the field of vision, corresponding to the lesion may be noted by many patients. Signs A nterior segment signs. Usually, there are no external signs and the eye looks quiet. However, fine KPs may be seen on biomicroscopy due to associated cyclitis. Vitreous opacities due to choroiditis are usually present in its middle or posterior part. These may be fine, coarse, stringy, or snowball opacities. Ill. Features of a patch of choroiditis are as below . Active patch of choroiditis, looks, like a pale-yellow or dirty white raised area with ill-defined edges . This results due to exudation and cellular infiltration of the choroid which hide the choroidal vessels. The lesion is typically deeper into the retinal vessels. The overlying retina is often cloudy and oedematous. There may be associated vasculitis. Healed patch of choroiditis , when active inflammation subsides, becomes more: sharply defined and delineated from the rest of the normal area due to atrophy of choroidal tissue. The involved area shows a white sclera below the atrophic choroid and black-pigmented clumps at the periphery of the lesion. A healed patch of chorioretinitis must be differentiated from degenerative conditions such as pathological myopia and retinitis pigmentosa.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Pars planitis- Pars planitis is an idiopathic chronic intermediate uveitis that predominantly affects children and adolescents and accounts for 5-26.7% of pediatric uveitis. Although an autoimmune process with a genetic predisposition has been suggested, its etiology still remains unknown. Option: C. Anterior uveitis- Symptoms of acute anterior uveitis include pain, photophobia, redness, tearing, blurred vision, and floaters. The pain of anterior uveitis usually results from acute inflammation of the iris and ciliary body and is most severe when the patient fixates on a near object, especially a light source. Option : D. Pars placiditis- Like any fracture, a pars defect is relatively serious and will require some form of treatment.</p>\n<p></p>",
