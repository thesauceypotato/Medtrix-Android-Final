Let\u2019s look at the functioning of the Medical Council of India (now the National Medical Council) and the State Medical Council. Medical Council of India: Maintains a medical register of all the medical practitioners who are enrolled with the State Medical Council, so if a doctor is enrolled with any State Medical Council, his name will automatically enroll in the register maintained with the Medical Council of India; Prescribes standards of undergraduate and postgraduate medical education for the guidance of the universities; Prescribes standards of undergraduate and postgraduate medical education for the guidance of the universities; Gives opinion in cases of appeal against disciplinary action when a medical practitioner appeals to the central government against the decision of the State Medical Council, then the central government asks for the consultation of Medical Council of India; and Prescribes standards of professional conduct and etiquette and Code of Ethics, it also issues warning notices listing certain practices which are regarded as \u2018serious professional misconduct\u2019. So, overall, the Medical Council of India functions to maintain the standard of medical education and medical practice. State Medical Councils work on more ground level. They maintain a medical register and each and every medical practitioner has to enroll with a State Medical Council to practice; Have disciplinary control over the medical practitioners; and Can issue warning notice as Medical Council of India.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Medical Council of India- It is not directly involved in disciplinary control over the medical practitioners. However, they are involved in appeals when a medical practitioner appeals against disciplinary action of the State Medical Council. The medical practitioner appeals to the central government against the decision of the State Medical Council, central government then consults of Medical Council of India. Option: C. Indian Medical Association- Indian Medical Association is the only representative, national voluntary organization of Doctors of Modern Scientific System of Medicine, which looks after the interest of doctors as well as the well-being of the community at large. Option: D. Courts of Law- Here you have to be careful. The question asked is about \u2018professional misconduct\u2019 and not about \u2018medical negligence\u2019. It is \u2018medical negligence\u2019, whether civil or criminal, where courts of law play their roles and will punish him if found guilty. However, if courts of law think fit, they can direct the respective State Medical Council to take disciplinary action against the doctor. At last, it will be the State Medical Council, that will take corrective</p>\n<p></p>",
