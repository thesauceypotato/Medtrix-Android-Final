Iodine uptake is a result of an active transport mechanism mediated by the NIS protein, which is found in the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells.

Salivary glands: NIS is present in the salivary glands and is responsible for iodide uptake to allow for iodine secretion in saliva. Gastric mucosa: NIS is expressed in the gastric mucosa, facilitating iodide uptake into gastric cells. Uterus and mammary glands: NIS expression is found in these tissues, likely to support iodine uptake for specific functions.</p>\n<p></p>",

Late proximal tubule\u2014Filtered glucose, amino acids, and HCO3 have already been completely removed from the tubular fluid by reabsorption in the early proximal tubule. In the late proximal tubule, Na+ is reabsorbed with Cl-. Thus, higher concentration of Cl- is left behind by processes in early PCT so as to facilitate diffusion of Cl into renal interstitium on its own. Although the amount of Na in the tubular fluid decreases markedly along the PCT lumen, the concentration of Na and total osmolarity still remains relatively constant. This is due to the high permeability of PCT to water leading to increased water reabsorption; which keeps us with the changes in osmolarity by sodium reabsorption.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option A. Glucose: Glucose is almost entirely reabsorbed in the PCT. Under normal conditions, there should be very little to no glucose left in the tubular lumen after passing through the PCT. Option B.

Figure shows the sigmoid nature of the oxygen dissociation curve of haemoglobin A and the effect of hydrogen ions on the position of the curve. The amount by which the curve is shifted may be expressed by the p 50 O 2 (i.e. the partial pressure of oxygen at which the haemoglobin is 50% saturated).

Option: B. Increased 2,3 BPG: An increase in 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3 BPG) reduces hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, causing a rightward shift of the O2 dissociation curve. This shift facilitates oxygen release in the tissues, making it easier for oxygen to be delivered to the cells, especially during conditions like hypoxia. Option: C. Increased CO2 levels (Carbon Dioxide): Increased CO2 levels lead to the formation of carbonic acid (H2CO3) in the blood, resulting in a decrease in pH (acidosis). Option: D.

During ingestion of a meal, the pathways can be activated by stimuli originating in the brain or stimuli originating in the stomach, such as mechanical stimulation (eg, distension) or chemical stimulation (eg, protein). The cephalic phase is of relatively short duration, and is responsible for 20-30% of the total amount of gastric acid secreted because of a meal. Mechanical distention of food entering the stomach triggers the vagovagal reflex arc by way of stretch receptors in the stomach wall. During the gastric phase, 60-70% of all the acid for the meal is secreted.

Of these three, acetylcholine has the largest effect. Parietal cells, G cells, and enterochromaffin-like cells are stimulated by acetylcholine released in response to vagus nerve stimulation. The second messenger triggered by acetylcholine in parietal cells is phospholipase C . Phospholipase C forms inositol triphosphate (IP 3 ) from membrane bound phospholipids, which in turn leads to release of intracellular calcium . Protein kinases are triggered by the increase in intracellular calcium, and the protein kinases lead to activation of H + /K + -ATPase, which secretes acid into the gastric lumen. Ghrelin, a pro-hunger peptide, also stimulates acid secretion from the gastric mucosa via vagally mediated histamine release .</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Evaporation At an atmospheric temperature of 47 degrees Celsius, the body mainly loses temperature by \"Evaporation.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>There are four avenues of heat loss: convection, conduction, radiation, and evaporation. If skin temperature is greater than that of the surroundings, the body can lose heat by radiation and conduction. But, if the temperature of the surroundings is greater than that of the skin, the body actually gains heat by radiation and conduction. In such conditions, the only means by which the body can rid itself of heat is by evaporation. So, when the surrounding temperature is higher than the skin temperature, anything that prevents adequate evaporation will cause the internal body temperature to rise</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option A. Conduction: This is the transfer of heat from the body to objects in direct contact with it, such as sitting on a hot surface. However, at a high atmospheric temperature, conduction may not be as significant. Option B. Convection: Convection involves the transfer of heat through the movement of air or fluid around the body. While convection can aid in cooling the body, it might not be the primary mode of heat loss at a high atmospheric temperature. Option C. Radiation: Radiation is the transfer of heat in the form of infrared waves. The body radiates heat to the surrounding environment, but at a very high atmospheric temperature, the heat gain from the environment might exceed the heat loss by radiation.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>6 The metabolic equivalent of task (MET) is the objective measure of the ratio of the rate at which a person expends energy , relative to the mass of that person, while performing some specific physical activity compared to a reference, set by convention at 3.5 mL of oxygen per kilogram per minute, which is roughly equivalent to the energy expended when sitting quietly. MET score= oxygen consumption during exercise/basal oxygen consumption (taken as one MET) MET score=1500/250=6</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The MET concept represents a simple, practical, and easily understandable procedure for expressing the energy cost of physical activities as a multiple of the resting metabolic rate. If the MET score is low, it means that the activity requires less oxygen compared to an activity that has a higher MET score. Eg. Gardening requires around 3-7 METS compared to jogging that may need around 9-11 METS. We can classify activities as light, moderate or heavy, depending on MET scores. It can also be used to identify the functional capacity of a patient.</p>\n<p></p>",
