      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Thickening and splitting of the GBM Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting the glomerular basement membrane, resulting in thickening and splitting of the membrane. This leads to progressive renal failure, with features such as hematuria, proteinuria, and eventually end-stage renal disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Alport syndrome: It is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive renal failure, sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities. It follows all modes of inheritance : The most common being X-linked dominant Cause: Mutations in genes that encode type IV collagen , which is an essential component of basement membranes in the kidney, ear, and eye. (COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 genes) Renal biopsy: Splitting of the glomerular basement membrane Electron microscopy: Basket-weave appearance IF: No specific immunofluorescence finding in Alport syndrome. Features: Eye problem - Retinopathy, anterior lenticonus, kidney- glomerulonephritis, ear- sensorineural hearing loss Most common manifestation: Gross hematuria</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A . Mesangial hypercellularity: It is not a characteristic feature of Alport syndrome on renal biopsy. Mesangial hypercellularity is seen in a variety of glomerular diseases including IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and lupus nephritis. Option: B. Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis: It is a feature of chronic kidney disease and is not specific to Alport syndrome. Option: D. Diffuse global glomerulosclerosis: It is a feature of end-stage renal disease and is not specific to Alport syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Mutation in alpha-5 chain of collagen type IV: Alport syndrome Mutation in alpha-3 chain of collagen type IV: Goodpasture syndrome</p>\n<p></p>",
