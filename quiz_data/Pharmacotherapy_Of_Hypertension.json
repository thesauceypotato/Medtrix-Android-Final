Clonidine is a partial agonist with high affinity and high intrinsic activity at \u03b12 receptors, especially the \u03b12A subtype in the brainstem. The major hemodynamic effects result from stimulation of \u03b12A receptors present mainly postjunctional in the medulla (vasomotor center). This decreases sympathetic outflow resulting in a fall in BP and bradycardia. Enhanced vagal tone contributes to bradycardia. Though clonidine is capable of reducing NA release from peripheral adrenergic nerve endings (release inhibitory prejunctional \u03b12 action), this is not manifest at clinically used doses. Clonidine is a moderately potent antihypertensive.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Phenoxybenzamine is a nonselective alpha blocker Option: C.
