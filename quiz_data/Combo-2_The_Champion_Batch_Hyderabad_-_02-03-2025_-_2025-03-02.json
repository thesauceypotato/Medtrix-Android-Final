The nicotinic actions of acetylcholine refer to the effect acetylcholine has on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels found in the nervous system and at the neuromuscular junction . Normally acetylcholine decreases blood pressure and heart rate due to its action of muscarinic receptors.
