The other output (the rubrospinal projection) goes to the opposite rhombencephalic reticular formation and spinal cord, making up the rubrospinal tract , which runs ventrally to the lateral corticospinal tract . As stated earlier, the rubrospinal tract is more important in non-primate species. In primates , because of the well-developed cerebral cortex, the corticospinal tract has taken over the role of the rubrospinal.</p>\n<p></p>",
