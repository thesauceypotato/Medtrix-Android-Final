Heat- and moisture-labile materials can also be sterilized using radioactive radiation or exposure to ethylene oxide gas.

This could include a sample of a microorganism, virus, or toxin that can adversely affect human health. A biohazard could also be a substance harmful to other animals. Examples include human and animal blood, tissues, certain body fluids, recombinant DNA, and human, animal, or plant pathogens.\u201d In layman's terms, biohazardous waste is any waste contaminated with potentially infectious materials.

Bactericidal refers to the property by which a biocide can kill bacteria. Bactericidal action differs from bacteriostasis only in irreversible (i.e., the \u201ckilled\u201d organism can no longer reproduce even after being removed from contact with the agent). In some cases, the agent causes lysis (dissolution) of the cells; in other cases, the cells remain intact and may continue to be metabolically active. (The terms fungicidal, sporicidal, and virucidal refer to the property whereby biocides can kill fungi, spores, and viruses, respectively.) Option B. Bacteriostatic refers to the property by which a biocide can inhibit bacterial multiplication; multiplication resumes upon removal of the agent. (The terms fungistatic and prostatic refer to biocides that inhibit the growth of fungi and spores, respectively.) Septic is Characterized by pathogenic microbes in living tissues or associated fluids Option D. Aseptic - Free of, or using methods to keep free of, microorganisms.</p>\n<p></p>",
