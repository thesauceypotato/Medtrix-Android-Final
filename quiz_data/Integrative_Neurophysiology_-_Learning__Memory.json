Neuroscience acknowledges the existence of many types of memory and their physical location within the brain is likely to be dependent on the respective system mediating the encoding of this memory. Memories are stored in the brain by changing the basic sensitivity of synaptic transmission between neurons as a result of previous neural activity.

Glutamate acts on both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors in the CNS. There are three subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, each named for its relatively specific agonist. These are the AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A . Gamma-amino-butyric acid: GABA is the major inhibitory mediator in the brain and mediates both presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition . The increase in Cl\u2013 conductance produced by GABAA receptors is potentiated by benzodiazepines (eg, diazepam). These drugs have marked antianxiety activity and are also effective muscle relaxants, anticonvulsants, and sedatives. Benzodiazepines bind to \u03b1 subunits of GABAA receptors. Barbiturates such as phenobarbital are effective anticonvulsants because they enhance GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition and suppress AMPA receptor-mediated excitation. Option: B . Glycine has both excitatory and inhibitory effects in the CNS. When it binds to NMDA receptors, it makes them more sensitive to the actions of glutamate. Glycine may spill over from synaptic junctions into the interstitial fluid and in the spinal cord; for example, it may facilitate pain transmission by NMDA receptors in the dorsal horn. However, glycine mediates direct inhibition in the brainstem and spinal cord. The glycine receptor that mediates inhibition is a Cl\u2013 channel, a pentamer made up of two subunits: the ligand-binding \u03b1 subunit and the structural \u03b2 subunit. Option: D . Lysine: It is an amino acid.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Excessive levels of glutamate occur in response to ischemia, anoxia, hypoglycemia, or trauma. Glutamate and some of its synthetic agonists are unique in that when they act on neuronal cell bodies, they can produce so much Ca2+ influx that the neurons die. Excitotoxins play a significant role in the damage done to the brain by a stroke. When a cerebral artery is occluded, the cells in the severely ischemic area die. The surrounding partially ischemic cells may survive but lose their ability to maintain the transmembrane Na+ gradient. The elevated levels of intracellular Na+ prevent the ability of astrocytes to remove glutamate from the brain\u2019s extracellular fluid. Therefore, glutamate accumulates to the point that excitotoxic damage and cell death occur in the penumbra, the region around the completely infarcted area. In addition, excessive glutamate receptor activation may contribute to the pathophysiology of some neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's Riluzole is a voltage-gated channel blocker that may antagonize N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. It slows the progression of impairment and modestly improves the life expectancy of patients with ALS. Memantine, another NMDA receptor antagonist, has been used to slow the progressive decline in patients with Alzheimer's Amantadine, another NMDA receptor antagonist, in conjunction with levodopa, improves function in patients with Parkinson's</p>\n<p></p>",
