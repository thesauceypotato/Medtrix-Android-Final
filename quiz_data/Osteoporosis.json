      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The Serum mineralisation is usually normal In osteoporosis, serum mineralization is usually normal. Calcium, phosphate, and Alkaline phosphatase are usually normal. This patient sustained an osteoporotic L1 compression fracture. Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone quantity with normal bone quality. Compression fractures of vertebrae (mostly dorsolumbar region) are the most common type of fragility fracture in patients with osteoporosis. Management of this patient needs proper evaluation to identify the etiology of the fracture and appropriate intervention to rectify the underlying pathology. Evaluation includes bone densitometry and lab testing of Vitamin D and calcium. As per WHO, Osteoporosis is defined by T,-scores 2.5 or greater standard deviations below the peak bone mass of a 25-year-old individual.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. The DEXA T-score less than -2.5 confirms the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Option: B. Kyphoplasty is indicated for recalcitrant cases where severe pain symptoms remain after 6 weeks of nonoperative treatment Option: D . Vitamin D levels are generally low in osteoporotic patients ( <20ng/mL considered deficient); this is not diagnostic. The DEXA scan remains the most accurate and supported diagnostic modality.</p>\n<p></p>",

She was prescribed Prolia 60 mg subcutaneously (SC) injections every 6 months and given calcium 1000 mg/day and vitamin D 400 IU/day. Identify the drug and mention its mechanism of action.",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Denosumab \u2013 RANK Ligand inhibitor Antiresorptive drugs (e.g. bisphosphonates, estrogen, denosumab) reduce bone turnover by distinct mechanisms. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds RANKL, preventing RANKL from activating RANK, its receptor on the osteoclast surface. With reduced RANK\u2013RANKL binding, osteoclast formation, function and survival are inhibited, bone resorption decreases and bone mass increases. (Prolia is the famous brand name of Denosumab)</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Treatment: Medications are broadly divided into three categories A. Inhibit Resorption of bone \u25cf       Bisphosphonates \u25cf       Calcitonin \u25cf       Estrogen \u25cf       SERM B. Promote formation of bone \u25cf       Teriparatide \u25cf       Calcium \u25cf       Calcitriol C. Dual action \u25cf       Strontium ranelate D. Denosumab \u25cf       It is a monoclonal antibody, which blocks RANK- ligand E. Newer drugs for post-menopausal osteoporosis \u25cf       Romosuzumab: dual action \u25cf       Abaloparatide: Promotes bone formation</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. In contrast to Denosumab , bisphosphonates bind bone minerals , where they are absorbed by mature osteoclasts, inducing osteoclast apoptosis and suppressing resorption. Nitrogen-containing Bisphosphonates \u2013 target a specific metabolic enzyme, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), preventing the usual modification of intracellular proteins required for osteoclast function and survival. Option: C. Teriparatide is the Recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1\u201334) (20 \u03bcg/day), approved by the US FDA for treating post-menopausal osteoporosis and male osteoporosis secondary to hypogonadism. It is the first approved anabolic or bone-building drug where bone formation is stimulated more than resorption. Osteoblast formation is increased, and osteoblast apoptosis is inhibited, which increases bone turnover and formation. Therefore, intermittent administration increases the number of bone-forming osteoblasts, whereas continuous administration increases the number of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Option: D. Calcitonin inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption by regulating the number and activity of osteoclasts.</p>\n<p></p>",
