He grasps the foot firmly with one hand and the knee with the other. The knee joint is completely flexed. The foot is rotated externally and the leg abducted. The joint is now slowly extended keeping the leg externally rotated and abducted. As the torn cartilage gets caught during this manoeuvre, the patient will experience pain or a click may be heard and felt. The angle at which these symptoms occurs indicates the position of the tear. The more posterior the tear, the more flexed position of the knee is, when the sign becomes positive. A similar test with the foot internally rotated and leg adducted is carried out for laternal meniscus tears. Apley's grinding test: The patient lies prone on the couch. The surgeon places one hand on the back of the thigh, and with the other hand flexes the knee is flexed to 90\u00ba. The surgeon now applies compression along the long axis of the tibia while rotating it on the femur (grinding movement). Pain during this movement indicates a meniscal tear. Pain on lateral rotation indicates a medial meniscal tear while that on medial rotation indicates a lateral meniscal tear. Tests for integrity of the ligaments: There are four main ligaments in the knee. The medial collateral ligament (MCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). Integrity of these can be tested by the following tests. Medial and lateral collateral ligaments (Fig-13a): With the patient lying supine, the leg is lifted and held in the axilla. The knee is kept in 20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 of flexion. Gentle adduction (to test LCL) and abduction (to test MCL) force is applied, as if one is trying to 'force open' the joint on one or the other side. The fingers over the joint line can appreciate 'opening-up' of the joint. Even if the joint does not open up but an attempt to do so produces pain at the ligament, it indicates a partial tear of the ligament being tested. Anterior cruciate ligament: This is the most frequently injured ligament of the knee. It can be tested by the following methods: Anterior drawer test (Fig-13b): The patient lies supine. The knee is flexed to 90\u00b0 with the foot flat on the couch. The examiner sits lightly on the foot to stabilise it. The upper end of the tibia is held between two hands in such a way that fingers are behind the knee, the thenar eminences over the tibial condyles and the tips of the thumbs, one on each femoral condyle. The fingers behind the knee check for relaxation of the hamstrings when this test is being performed. A gentle pull is applied on the upper end of tibia and forward movement of the tibia in relation to the femoral condyles appreciated. Normally, there is a glide of upto half a centimeter. Anything more than this is suggestive of ACL laxity. Lachmann test: This test is considered better than anterior drawer test. In this test, the knee is kept in 15 to 20 of flexion. One hand supports the thigh just above the knee and the other grasps the upper end of the tibia (Fig-13c). The extent of anterior glide indicates integrity of anterior cruciate ligament. This test is difficult to perform in bulky, muscular individuals, as in them it is difficult to hold the thigh and tibia. Posterior cruciate ligament: This ligament is injured uncommonly. One can suspect such an injury by carefully observing backward sagging of the upper end of the tibia. It can be further confirmed by the following test: Posterior drawer test: It is like anterior drawer test except, one has to make a note of how much is it possible to push the tibia backwards.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. MCL injury does not give a positive Dial test. The valgus stress test, also known as the medial stress test, is used to assess the integrity of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) of the knee Option: B. Medial Meniscal Injury does not give a positive Dial test. One of the main tests for meniscus tears is the McMurray test Option: C.

SQuat test -A simple version of Thessaly test In the 'sQuat test' where a patient performs a deep sQuat and this reproduces a mechanical pain in the affected knee.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Meniscal injury There are two meniscus medial and lateral supports the knee. The medial meniscus is more commonly injured as: weight bearing axis passes through medial side (ii) It is large and fixed at margins by capsule. Function of meniscus These prevent the impingement of capsule and synovium during flexion and extension of knee. They are believed to have a joint lubricating function also. Patho Physiology Meniscus or semilunar cartilage are relatively avascular structure with poor healing potential. 2. Because of the avascular nature of inner two thirds of the meniscus; cell nutrition is believed to occur mainly through diffusion or mechanical pumping. So inner avascular meniscus once torn does not heal. The meniscus may become completely displaced and locked between the femur and tibia, preventing full extension of the knee. The torn meniscus will cause pain, intermittent catching and occasionly locking as it flips into and out of the region of contact between the femur & the tibia. Mechanism of injury These are usually torn by rotation over a semi flexed knee Medial meniscus is more frequently torn than the lateral because the medial meniscus is securely attached around the entire periphery of the joint capsule, which makes it less mobile. The lateral meniscus is more mobile and has no weak point between a movable and relatively fixed point. Popliteus muscle sends few fibers into the posterior margin of lateral meniscus. Thus muscle contraction withdraws & protects the lateral meniscus by drawing it posterolaterally during flexion of the knee and medial rotation of the tibia. Medial and Lateral meniscus McMurray's test: With the patient in supine position the knee is acutely and forcibly flexed. The foot is rotated externally. Now the examiner palpates the posteromedial margin of the joint with one hand and by other the foot if firmly grasped. Now the knee is slowly extended. As the femur passes over the torn part of the meniscus a click may be heard. The angle of flexion at which the symptoms occurs indicates the position of the tear. The more posterior is the tear, the more flexed position of the knee is when the sign becomes positive. For lateral meniscus similar test with the foot internally rotated and examiner's hand palpating the posterolateral aspect of knee is carried out. Apley's grinding test: The patient lies prone on the couch. The knee is flexed to 90 degree and the thigh is fixed to the examination table by placing one hand on the back of the thigh. The surgeon now applies compression along the long axis of the tibia while rotating it medially and laterally on the femur (grinding movement). Pain on lateral rotation indicates a medial meniscal tear while that on medial rotation indicates a lateral meniscal tear. The Squat test is a clinical test used for the diagnosis of Menisci tear (Payr's sign)</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.

These cover approximately 2/3 of the tibia surface and are thicker on the outside and thinner on the inside appearing triangular in cross-section. They fill the space between the leg bones and cushion the femur so it doesn't slide off or rub against the tibia. The knee has 2 collateral (parallel) ligaments and 2 cruciate (crossing) ligaments. The medial collateral ligament (MCL) and the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) provide support to the knee by limiting the sideways motion of the joint and resisting extreme rotation in a partially flexed position. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) stabilize the knee by limiting the rotation and the forward and backward movement of the joint. The medial meniscus is much less mobile than the lateral, and it cannot as easily accommodate abnormal So meniscal lesions are more common on the medial side than on the lateral.
