The mite is small (0.2 \u2013 0.4mm) and can only be seen through a microscope or magnifying glass. Humans acquire the disease from the bite of an infected chigger. The bite of the mite leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful to the doctor for making the diagnosis. The adult mites have a four-stage life cycle: egg, larva, nymph and adult. The larva is the only stage (chigger) that can transmit the disease to humans and other vertebrates, since the other life stages (nymph and adult) do not feed on vertebrate animals . Both the nymph and the adult are free-living in the soil.</p>\n<p></p>",

Botulinum toxin contains 2 chains: Heavy and light. The heavy chain binds presynaptically to nerve terminals and is responsible for mediating translocation of light chain into the cell. The light chain is active part which cleaves host protein SNAP 25. The cleaved SNAP 25 prevents the release of neurotransmitter Acetylcholine and is responsible for flaccid paralysis. Tetanus toxin causes cleavage of synaptobrevin and prevents the release of neurotransmitters GABA and glycine which causes spastic paralysis.

Cysteine Lactose Electrolyte Deficient Agar (CLED) is a non selective media and it stimulates the growth of staphylococcus and candida whereas MacConkey agar is a selective media. Both CLED and MacConkey Agar inhibits the swarming of proteus and differentiates between lactose fermenter and non lactose fermenter. Both use sodium taurocholate as a selective agent and so option (c) is a better option. Hence CLED is an important media which combines benefits of both Blood agar and MacConkey\u2019s agar in one media eliminating the need of putting culture on blood agar additionally saving time and media requirement for processing urinary sample and isolation of uropathogen.</p>\n<p></p>",
