Long head of biceps femoris and common fibular nerve The long head of Biceps femoris receives innervation from the tibial division of Sciatic nerve. Option C. Semitendinosus and tibial nerve The tibial component of the sciatic nerve innervates Semitendinosus. Option D. Semimembranosus and tibial nerve The tibial component of the sciatic nerve innervates Semimembranosus.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The common criteria of hamstring muscles are: Muscles should originate from the ischial tuberosity. Muscles should be i nserted over the knee joint, in the tibia or the fibula. The tibial branch of the sciatic nerve will innervate muscles . Muscles will participate in flexion of the knee joint and extension of the hip joint. Those muscles that fulfil all four criteria are called true hamstrings. The adductor magnus reaches only up to the adductor tubercle of the femur. Still, i t is included among the hamstrings because the tibial collateral ligament of the knee joint morphologically is the degenerated tendon of this muscle. The ligament is attached to the medial epicondyle, two millimetres from the adductor tubercle.</p>\n<p></p>",
