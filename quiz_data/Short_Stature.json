      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>A is brain growth Different tissues grow at different rates: Brain growth: brain enlarges rapidly during the latter months of fetal life and early months of postnatal life. At birth, head size is 65 to 70% of the expected head size in adults. It reaches 90%adult head size by the age of 2yrs. Somatic growth: skeletal growth is a continuous process occurring during whole childhood and adolescence. It is steady until the pubertal growth spurt when it accelerates and subsequently slows considerably. The skeleton is mature once the epiphysis or growth plate at end of the long bone fuses to the shaft or diaphysis. This occurs by about 18yrs in girls and 20 to 21yrs in boys. The degree of skeletal maturity closely correlates with the degree of sexual maturity Lymphoid growth: lymphoid tissue is more notable during mid-childhood. During this period, lymphoid tissue is overgrown and its mass may appear to be larger than that of fully mature adults. A sign of accelerated lymphoid tissue growth is the frequent finding of large tonsils and palpable lymph nodes in normal children between 4 and to 8yrs age. Gonadal growth: it is dormant during childhood and becomes conspicuous during pubescence</p>\n<p></p>",
