Lidocaine effectively targets ischemic areas of the heart. Ischemic cells will be depolarized, and Na channels will be inactivated. So, Lignocaine targets this state of the Na channel and prolongs this state in ischemic cells without affecting normal myocardial cells. So, arrhythmias arising from the ischemic zone are stopped. That\u2019s why it is the DOC in Ventricular tachycardia with MI.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. propranolol is a medication of the beta blocker class. It is used to treat high blood pressure, several types of irregular heart rate, thyrotoxicosis, capillary hemangiomas, performance anxiety, essential tremors, and to prevent migraine headaches. Option: Digoxin is a medicine used to treat heart failure in combination with other medicines. It helps to provide symptomatic relief by making the heart pump blood more efficiently. This medicine is also used to treat abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia). Option: D. atropine is a tropane alkaloid and anticholinergic medication used to treat certain types of nerve agents and pesticide poisonings, as well as some types of slow heart rate, and to decrease saliva production during surgery.</p>\n<p></p>",

Still, it cannot cure the arrhythmia, i.e., it does not revert it to sinus rhythm. Often, AFL may be converted into AF because digoxin abbreviates atrial ERP and makes it more inhomogeneous. Digoxin reduces the ventricular rate in AF and afl by decreasing the number of impulses that can pass down the A-V node and bundle of His. It increases ERP of the A-V node by direct, vagomimetic, and antiadrenergic actions: The minimum interval between consecutive impulses that can successfully traverse the conducting tissue is prolonged.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B.

Metoprolol is a selective \u03b21 receptor blocker medication.

Bisoprolol belongs to a group of medicines called beta-blockers. It is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), angina (heart-related chest pain), and irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmia). It also helps to prevent future heart attacks and stroke and to prevent migraine Option: D. Carvedilol is a medicine used to treat high blood pressure, heart-related chest pain (angina), and heart failure. It works by relaxing the blood vessels so that blood can flow more easily to the heart. Lowering blood pressure also helps prevent future heart attacks and strokes.</p>\n<p></p>",
