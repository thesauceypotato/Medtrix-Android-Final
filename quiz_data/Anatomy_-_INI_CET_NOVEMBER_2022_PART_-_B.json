Common peroneal nerve The most common presentation with common peroneal nerve injury or palsy is acute foot drop</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Foot drop is a gait abnormality in which the dropping of the forefoot happens due to weakness, irritation or damage to the deep fibular nerve (deep peroneal), including the sciatic nerve, or paralysis of the muscles in the anterior portion of the lower leg. It is usually a symptom of a greater problem, not a disease in itself. Foot drop is characterized by inability or impaired ability to raise the toes or raise the foot from the ankle (dorsiflexion). Foot drop may be temporary or permanent, depending on the extent of muscle weakness or paralysis and it can occur in one or both feet. In walking, the raised leg is slightly bent at the knee to prevent the foot from dragging along the ground.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Sural nerve has its origins within the sciatic nerve, coming from terminal branches of the tibial and common fibular nerves Directly innervates the skin over the posterolateral aspect of the distal third of the leg. Option B: Tibial nerve Tibial nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve , and arises at the apex of the popliteal fossa. It travels through the popliteal fossa, giving off branches to muscles in the superficial posterior compartment of the leg. The tibial nerve continues its course down the leg, posterior to the tibia. During its descent, it supplies the deep muscles of the posterior leg . Option D. Femoral nerve is a mixed nerve of the lower limb that innervates the muscles and skin of the hip and thigh . The femoral nerve originates from the lumbar plexus The femoral nerve is split by the lateral circumflex femoral artery into an anterior and posterior division.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Foot drop can be caused by nerve damage alone or by muscle or spinal cord trauma, abnormal anatomy, toxins, or disease. Toxins include organophosphate compounds which have been used as pesticides and as chemical agents in warfare. The poison can lead to further damage to the body such as a neurodegenerative disorder called organophosphorus induced delayed polyneuropathy. This disorder causes loss of function of the motor and sensory neural pathways. In this case, foot drop could be the result of paralysis due to neurological dysfunction. Diseases that can cause foot drop include trauma to the posterolateral neck of fibula, stroke,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, poliomyelitis, Charcot Marie Tooth disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, hereditary spastic paraplegia, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Welander distal myopathy, Friedreich's ataxia and Chronic Compartment Syndrome . It may also occur as a result of hip replacement surgery or knee ligament reconstruction surgery.</p>\n<p></p>",

The most common aetiology resulting in Klumpke palsy is a hyper-abduction trauma to the arm.  The patient may present with a \" claw hand .\" This deformity presents a finger and wrist flexion.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>An ulnar claw, also known as claw hand or 'spinster's claw', is a deformity or an abnormal attitude of the hand that develops due to ulnar nerve damage causing paralysis of the lumbricals. A claw hand presents with a hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal joints and flexion at the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of the 4th and 5th fingers. The patients with this condition can make a full fist but when they extend their fingers, the hand posture is referred to as claw hand.

Horner\u2019s syndrome Horner syndrome is a rare condition classically presenting with partial ptosis (drooping or falling of the upper eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and facial anhidrosis (absence of sweating) due to a disruption in the sympathetic nerve supply. This feature is also seen in Klumpke\u2019s paralysis. Option B. Policeman\u2019s tip hand Erb's palsy results from injury to nerve roots C5 and C6, with C7 also affected in 50% of instances.The classical sign of Erb's palsy is the 'waiter's tip hand'. The arm hangs limply from the shoulder with internal rotation of the forearm plus wrist and finger flexion. Option C. Wrist drop Wrist drop is a disorder caused by radial nerve palsy. Because of the radial nerve's innervation of the extensor muscles of the wrist and digits, those whose radial nerve function has been compromised cannot actively extend them.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Patients exhibiting an ulnar claw are also very frequently unable to spread (abduct) or pull together (adduct) their fingers against resistance. This occurs because the ulnar nerve also innervates the palmar and dorsal interossei of the hand. Patients with this deficit will become increasingly easy to identify over time as the paralysed first dorsal interosseous muscle atrophies, leaving a prominent hollowing between the thumb and forefinger.</p>\n<p></p>",
