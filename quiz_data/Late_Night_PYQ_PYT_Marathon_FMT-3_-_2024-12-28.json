C) Chicken Fat Appearance</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The \"Chicken Fat Appearance\" is not a characteristic of antemortem clots but rather of postmortem clots. Antemortem clots are typically well-formed, adherent to the vessel wall, and display a laminated structure with visible lines of Zahn\u2014alternating layers of lighter staining platelets and fibrin with darker red blood cells. These features indicate active biological processes that occur before death, involving clotting factors and cellular elements.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
