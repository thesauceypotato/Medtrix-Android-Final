These infants are at increased risk of hypoglycemia due to maternal hyperglycemia leading to fetal hyperinsulinemia. When the maternal glucose supply is removed at birth, the high insulin levels can cause a rapid drop in the infant's blood glucose.

The Tokyo guidelines recommend early cholecystectomy within 5-7 days for mild cases (Tokyo I). For this 45-year-old patient whose symptoms are controlled with medical management, proceeding with laparoscopic cholecystectomy on the next available elective list (during the same admission) is the optimal approach, as it reduces the risk of recurrent attacks while operating when inflammation has started to resolve.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Observation and regular follow-up - This is inappropriate for a patient who has already experienced acute cholecystitis. Once symptomatic complications occur, definitive surgical management is required to prevent recurrent attacks, which can be more severe and lead to additional complications.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Observation and regular follow-up</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Elective cholecystectomy after inflammation subsides - This approach represents delayed surgery scheduled weeks to months after discharge, which is now considered an outdated practice. It increases the risk of recurrent episodes during the waiting period and can lead to more difficult surgery due to scarring and adhesions.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Elective cholecystectomy after inflammation subsides</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Urgent open cholecystectomy - Open cholecystectomy is not the first-line approach unless laparoscopic surgery is contraindicated. For mild to moderate cases that have been medically stabilized, there is no indication for urgent open surgery, as laparoscopic approach offers less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
