Diffusion Hypoxia : After discontinuation of N2O, the rapid diffusion of N2O out of the blood into the alveoli can dilute alveolar oxygen. Providing 100% oxygen prevents the dilution of alveolar oxygen, thus preventing diffusion hypoxia.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Diffusion Hypoxia</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Hyperoxia : Administering 100% oxygen could potentially lead to hyperoxia, but in the context of the immediate post-anesthetic period, it is used as a preventive strategy against hypoxia, not as a cause of hyperoxia.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Hyperoxia</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Bronchospasm : Bronchospasm is a potential adverse event related to anesthesia, but providing 100% oxygen post-extubation does not specifically address bronchospasm; it is more about ensuring adequate oxygenation.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
