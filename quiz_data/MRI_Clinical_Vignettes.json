Even with the best surgical efforts, microscopic tumor cells are often left behind, leading to recurrence.</li><li>\u2022 Tumor Recurrence: GBM has a high tendency to recur despite aggressive treatment. The tumor cells' ability to evade therapies and their resistance to standard treatments like radiation and chemotherapy contribute to frequent relapses.</li><li>\u2022 Limited Treatment Options: Despite advances in medical technology and therapies, GBM remains challenging to treat. The blood-brain barrier restricts the delivery of certain drugs, making it difficult to effectively target the tumor.</li><li>\u2022 Lack of Specific Biomarkers: GBM is a heterogeneous disease, meaning there is significant variability in the tumor's genetic makeup and response to treatments. Lack of well-defined biomarkers makes personalized treatment strategies difficult.</li><li>\u2022 Impact on Brain Function: The location of GBM within the brain can significantly impact neurological function, leading to various neurological deficits.</li><li>\u2022 Due to these factors, the median survival for patients with GBM is approximately 15-18 months from the time of diagnosis.
