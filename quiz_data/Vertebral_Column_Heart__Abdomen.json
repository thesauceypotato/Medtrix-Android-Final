      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hyper extension + hyperflexion Whiplash injury: It is caused due to a violent acceleration or deceleration force applied to the passenger, usually the front seat occupant. When the vehicle comes to a sudden stop due to head-on obstruction, the heavy head continues to move forward (acute hyperflexion). When the body comes to rest, or the head strikes an obstruction in front, there is then a reactionary hyperextension as the head is thrown backwards, this double movement being known as the 'whiplash'. lf a vehicle is hit violently from behind by another car, the head is thrown violently back into hyperextension and then forwards after the body stops moving. In either case. This violent extension-flexion movement can cause atlantooccipital dislocation in one-third of patients, or less commonly, a fracture-dislocation in the lower part of the spine at about C 5 and 6. Laceration of tendons and joint capsules, intra-articular haemorrhages and tears with separation of the cartilaginous lining of articular surfaces may occur. Fatal contusion or laceration of the spinal cord may occur without fracture of the Fracture or dislocation can also occur in the upper dorsal spine, often around T5 to T10. Head restraints (headrests) prevent hyperextension of the neck to a certain degree.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A, C & D. Anything other than the combination of hyperextension and hyperflexion is not related to whiplash injury. Hence there are better answers than these three options.</p>\n<p></p>",
