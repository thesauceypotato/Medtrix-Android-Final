However, its use is limited by its dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, which can manifest as acute changes or chronic cardiomyopathy. Recognizing the signs and symptoms of cardiotoxicity in patients previously treated with doxorubicin is crucial for timely management and intervention.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
