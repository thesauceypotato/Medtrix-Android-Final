Coagulation of cellular proteins Conversion of Hb to Haematin When ingested, they cause liquefaction necrosis of GI mucosa, mainly affecting the squamous epithelium of esophagus and thus permitting deeper invasion of tissues with deep burns and marked edema. They cause more severe injury than acids because they dissolve proteins and saponify fat. They produce soft, edematous, translucent gelatinous friable eschars and thus stricture formation is much more common with alkalies than acids. Treatment:- Demulscents, Oxygen inhalation, steroids to reduce stricture formation and symptomatic. PM findings: Angles of mouth, lips and oral cavity are dark and parchment-like. Esophagus and stomach show corrosion and the formation of slimy eschars. Esophageal stricture is the most common finding if the patient survives for a certain time.
