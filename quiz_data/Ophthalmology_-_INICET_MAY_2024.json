Night blindness is the characteristic and earliest feature in Retinitis Pigmentosa.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA Most common type- Autosomal recessive. Rod- Cone dystrophy. Visual Symptoms Night blindness- It is the characteristic and earliest feature . Dark adaptation- Light Threshold Of The Peripheral retina is increased. Tubular vision, i.e. loss of peripheral vision with preservation of central vision occurs in advanced cases. Central vision is also lost ultimately after many years. Fundus changes Retinal pigmentary changes- These are typically perivascular (around veins) and jet black spots resembling bone corpuscles shape. Retinal Arterioles Are Attenuated(narrowed). Thinning and atrophy of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) . Optic disc becomes pale and waxy in later stages and ultimately consecutive optic atrophy occurs. Visual Field changes Annular or ring-shaped scotoma - As the disease progresses, scotoma increases anteriorly and posteriorly and ultimately only central vision is left (tubular vision). Electrophysiological changes Electroretinogram (ERG) is initially subnormal (scotopic affected before photopic; b-wave affected before a wave) and eventually extinguished.
