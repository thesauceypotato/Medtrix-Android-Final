First source of blood glucose is dietary (food) glucose that can provide glucose for upto 2 hours after meals (option a is excluded). After that liver glycogenolysis will start and is able to maintain blood glucose for next 12-18 hours of fasting (option c is answer). Hepatic gluconeogenesis will start only after liver glycogen is exhausted i.e. only after 12 hours onwards (option b is wrong answer). Muscle glycogen cannot maintain blood glucose as the end-product of muscle glycogenolysis is glucose 6-phosphate due to absence of enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase in muscle (option D is wrong answer). This enzyme is only present in liver cell\u2019s ER and is used to convert glucose 6-phosphate to free glucose.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Niacin The major protein of Maize, \u201cZein\u201d lacks tryptophan which is required for Niacin biosynthesis. 60 mg of tryptophan gives 1 mg of Niacin in the body. So, pellagra is more common when maize is the staple diet due to decreased synthesis of Niacin. Pellagra is characterized by 3Ds i.e. diarrhoea, dementia and dermatitis. Death and delirium and depression can also occur. Pellagra can also be caused due to Isoniazid therapy as isoniazid inhibits PLP (B6) formation which in turn is required for Niacin synthesis. Vitamin B2 is also required for Niacin synthesis, so, a deficiency either of B2 or B6 or both can cause pellagra. Thiamine (B1) deficiency leads to Beri-Beri. CNS and CVS are affected in dry Beri-Beri and wet Beri-Beri respectively. Main symptoms of Riboflavin deficiency are Cheilosis, Glossitis and Corneal vascularization. Pyridoxine deficiency cause anemia (microcytic, hypochromic) and seizures in infants.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets As there is no response to Vitamin D supplementation so it cannot be option c and d. Vitamin D dependent rickets type I is due to 1-alpha hydroxylase defect in kidneys causing 25-OH D3 elevation whereas in Vitamin D dependent rickets type II there is a receptor defect leading to increased 1,25-dihydroxy D3 levels. In nutritional rickets, there is dietary deficiency of calcium, but calcium levels can be made normal due to 2 o increase in PTH. But in this case PTH levels are normal, so, nutritional rickets can also be ruled out. So, the only option left is X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets which is an X-linked inherited disorder characterized by urinary phosphate wasting. The PTH and Ca 2+ levels are normal, but phosphate levels are low in this case leading to soft and weak bones.</p>\n<p></p>",
