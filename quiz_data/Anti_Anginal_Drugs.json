In classical angina, the primary effect is to reduce cardiac work by action on peripheral vasculature, though increased blood supply to the ischaemic area may contribute.

However, most of these drugs are experimental and operate in a non-specific manner. Option: D. P/Q type calcium channel: only two specific P/Q-type blockers are known: both are peptides deriving from the spider venom of Agelenopsis aperta, \u03c9-agatoxins .
