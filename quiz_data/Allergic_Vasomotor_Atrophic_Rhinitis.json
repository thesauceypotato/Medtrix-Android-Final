Common causes are recurrent nasal infections, chronic sinusitis, and chronic nasal mucosa irritation due to smoking. Nasal obstruction is the predominant symptom. Nasal discharge is thick and sticky. Examination shows hypertrophy of turbinates. Turbinal mucosa is thick and does not pit on pressure. It shows slight shrinkage with vasoconstrictor drugs due to underlying fibrosis.
