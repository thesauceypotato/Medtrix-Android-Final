While it is true that C fibers are more sensitive to certain stimuli like hypoxia (lack of oxygen), this is not the primary cause of paresis and numbness experienced after sleeping on the arm. The symptoms in this case are more likely due to mechanical compression of the nerves rather than hypoxia. Option: D.

The body responds to this change by using certain measures in stage B such as shivering.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Shivering- the shivering center is located in the posterior hypothalamus. It is normally inhibited by signals from the heat center in the anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area but is excited by cold signals from the skin and spinal cord. A sudden increase in heat setpoint results in the activation of this center. It then transmits non-rhythmic signals through bilateral tracts through the lateral columns of the spinal cord, and finally to the anterior motor neurons. They increase the tone of the skeletal muscles throughout the body. As the tone rises above a certain critical level, shivering begins. During maximum shivering, body heat production can rise to four to five times normal. Vasoconstriction (decreased blood flow to skin) is mediated by increased sympathetic drive by the activation of the posterior hypothalamic sympathetic center.

NETs are structures released by neutrophils in response to certain stimuli, such as infections or inflammation.

(Option A & B) They allow neutrophils to kill extracellular pathogens while minimizing damage to the host cells. The NET scaffold consists of chromatin fibers while DNA and histones represent the major NET constituents. Figure :- NETs are visualized by containing neutrophil elastase (green) and nuclear material (DAPI, blue). As such, NETs may function as double-edged swords, serving as effective antimicrobial defenses, but also as putative sources of molecules with immune effector and proinflammatory roles that, in susceptible individuals, may promote tissue damage and autoimmunity. Further, other granulocytes (mast cells and eosinophils) can form extracellular traps upon stimulation, a process thus renamed as ETosis.

Carnitine, CPT1 and CPT2 enzyme are all part of carnitine cycle. Fatty acid transport into the mitochondria involves a multi-step process called carnitine shuttle. The steps are as follows: Fatty acids are activated to form fatty acyl-CoA in the cytoplasm. This step requires ATP and the enzyme fatty acyl-CoA synthetase. The fatty acyl group is transferred from CoA to carnitine, forming acylcarnitine. This transfer is catalyzed by an enzyme called carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I) located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Acylcarnitine is transported across the outer mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix by a carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase. Once inside the mitochondrial matrix, the acyl group is transferred back from carnitine to CoA by carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT-II), which is located on the inner mitochondrial membrane. The fatty acyl-CoA can then enter \u03b2-oxidation, a process that occurs in the mitochondrial matrix and leads to the production of ATP.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B - The acyl carrier Protein (ACP) is a cofactor of fatty acid synthase.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Paracrine Paracrine signaling is a form of cell communication in which cells secrete signaling molecules that act on nearby target cells. The signaling molecules, known as paracrine factors, are released into the extracellular space and diffuse over short distances to reach neighboring cells. These factors bind to specific receptors on the surface of target cells, initiating a signaling cascade that leads to a cellular response. Example: One example of paracrine signaling is the release of growth factors by cells to stimulate the division and growth of nearby cells. For instance, during tissue repair, platelets release growth factors that promote the proliferation of neighboring cells to aid in the healing process.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - As explained in the above chart - Option B , C and D are not the correct options. Option: B. Apocrine: Apocrine secretion is a type of glandular secretion in which a portion of the cell cytoplasm is released along with the secretory product. The apocrine glands accumulate the secretory product at the apical portion of the cell, and then this portion is pinched off, releasing the secretory product. Example: A well-known example of apocrine secretion is found in mammary glands. During lactation, mammary epithelial cells produce milk, and the milk is released through the apical portion of the cells, along with a small portion of the cell cytoplasm. Option: C. Merocrine: Merocrine secretion, also known as eccrine secretion, is a type of glandular secretion in which the secretory product is released by exocytosis without any loss of cytoplasm. The secretory product is synthesized and packaged in vesicles within the cell, and upon stimulation, these vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing the product into the extracellular space. Example: Sweat glands are an example of merocrine secretion. When body temperature rises, sweat glands secrete sweat onto the skin's surface to cool down the body. The sweat is produced and released through exocytosis without any loss of cytoplasm. Option: D. Endocrine: Endocrine signaling involves the secretion of hormones by endocrine glands directly into the bloodstream. These hormones are chemical messengers that travel through the bloodstream to reach distant target cells or organs. The target cells have specific receptors for the hormones, and upon binding, the hormones elicit specific responses in the target cells. Example: The release of insulin by the pancreas is an example of endocrine signaling. Insulin is secreted into the bloodstream in response to high blood glucose levels and acts on target cells throughout the body, regulating glucose uptake and metabolism.</p>\n<p></p>",

A negative feedback mechanism or loop is a pathway stimulated by the deviation in the output, which causes changes in output to the direction opposite to the initial deviation. Effect on the homeostasis A positive feedback mechanism breaks down the homeostasis system of the body. A negative feedback mechanism works to maintain the conditions of homeostasis in the body. Occurrence The positive feedback mechanism is less common and occurs in specific situations. The negative feedback mechanism is more common and occurs in different organs and systems in the body. Stability The positive feedback mechanism is less stable. The negative feedback mechanism is more stable. Effect In a system with a positive feedback mechanism, the effective input is increased by the addition of actual input with the feedback signal. In a system with a negative feedback mechanism, the effective input is decreased as the feedback signal inhibits the actual input. External interruption A positive feedback mechanism might require an external interruption. A negative feedback mechanism doesn\u2019t require an external interruption. Changes It enhances the change in physiological factors. It resists changes in physiological factors. Examples Positive feedback mechanism in nature is observed during childbirth in humans and during the ripening of fruits. The negative feedback mechanism is observed during thermoregulation and maintaining the blood glucose level. Feed Forward -  is a homeostatic control system in which the anticipatory effect that one intermediate exerts on another intermediate further along in the pathway allows the system to anticipate changes in a regulated variable.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Segment 1b represents Laplace Law The true statement regarding the given cystometrogram is that segment lb is due to Laplace law.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Cystometry is the dynamic measurement of detrusor pressure during the continuous filling of the bladder. The primary results of cystometric analysis is the cystometrogram. The x-axis is the volume of liquid and the y-axis is the intraluminal pressure of the bladder. The normal cystometrogram curve has two phases: a filling phase, including all normal parameters during the storage phase (first sensation, detrusor function, bladder compliance, and capacity) and a voiding phase on pressure flow study. Major Events of Micturition Urinary bladder distends as it fills with urine. Stretch receptors in the bladder wall are stimulated, and they signal the micturition center in the sacral spinal cord. Parasympathetic nerve impulses travel to the detrusor muscle, which responds by contracting rhythmically. The need to urinate is urgent. Voluntary contraction of the external urethral sphincter and inhibition of the micturition reflex by impulses from the brainstem and the cerebral cortex prevent urination. Following the decision to urinate, the external urethral sphincter is relaxed, and impulses from the pons and the hypothalamus facilitate the micturition reflex. The detrusor muscle contracts, and urine is expelled through the urethra. Neurons of the micturition reflex center fatigue, the detrusor muscle relaxes, and the bladder begins to fill with urine again.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Cystometrogram- 3 components: Option: B - Ia-Initial rise: initial sharp rise due to increase in intravesicular pressure to about 10 cm of water. Option: C - Ib~ Long flat segment; slight or no change in intravesicular pressure inspite of additional 350 ml of urine (Law of Laplace)\u2013 pressure increases with simultaneous increase in radius. Option: D - II: sudden sharp rise: due to addition of another 50 to 100 ml of urine\u2013 triggers the micturition.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Micturition reflex is the result of sensory signals from the stretch receptors in the bladder wall, which are conducted to the sacral segments of the cord through the pelvic nerves and then efferent signals conduct back again to the bladder through the parasympathetic nerve fibers.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Respiratory Acidosis Based on the given arterial blood gas (ABG) values, the patient's pH is 7.2, PaCO2 is 80 mmHg, and HCO3 is 35 mEq/L. In this case, the pH is below the normal range (7.35-7.45), indicating acidemia. The PaCO2 is elevated (greater than 45 mmHg), suggesting respiratory acidosis. The HCO3 is also elevated (greater than 26 mEq/L), which is not consistent with compensation for respiratory acidosis. Therefore, based on the ABG values, the acid-base disorder in this patient is Respiratory Acidosis (option A).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Normal blood pH is 7.35-7.45. PaCO2: 35-45 mmHg. HCO3: 22 to 26 mEq/L Since blood pH is 7.2 which is due to elevate PaCO2 levels this is a case of Respiratory acidosis. Respiratory disturbance leads to change in PaCO2 while metabolic disturbance is due to changes in HCO3 levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: B - Respiratory Alkalosis - Respiratory alkalosis occurs when high levels of carbon dioxide disrupt the blood's acid-base balance. It often occurs in people who experience rapid, uncontrollable breathing (hyperventilation). Treatment includes supplemental oxygen and therapies to reduce the risk of hyperventilation. Option: C - Metabolic Acidosis - Metabolic acidosis can be caused by acid accumulation due to increased acid production or acid ingestion; decreased acid excretion; or gastrointestinal or renal bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) loss. Metabolic acidoses are categorized based on whether the anion gap is high or normal Option: D - Metabolic Alkalosis - Metabolic alkalosis is primary increase in bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) with or without compensatory increase in carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pco2); pH may be high or nearly normal. Common causes include prolonged vomiting, hypovolemia, diuretic use, and hypokalemia.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Acid-base physiology Metabolic acid-base disorders cause HCO 3 - alterations.
