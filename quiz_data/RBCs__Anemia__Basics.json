Duodenal epithelial cell uptake of heme and nonheme iron is described in the text. When the storage sites of the body are replete with iron and erythropoietic activity is normal, plasma hepcidin balances iron uptake and loss to and maintains iron homeostasis by downregulating ferroportin and limiting iron uptake (middle panel). Hepcidin rises in the setting of systemic inflammation or when liver iron levels are high, decreasing iron uptake and increasing iron loss during the shedding of duodenocytes (right panel). Conversely, hepcidin levels fall in the setting of low plasma iron, primary hemochromatosis, or ineffective hematopoiesis (left panel), leading to a rise in iron absorption. DMTI, Divalent metal transporter I. Hepcidin: Iron absorption in the duodenum is regulated by hepcidin, a small circulating peptide that is synthesized and released from the liver in response to increases in intrahepatic iron levels. Hepcidin inhibits iron transfer from the enterocyte to plasma by binding to ferroportin , causing ferroportin to be endocytosed and degraded . As a result, as hepcidin levels rise , iron becomes trapped within duodenal cells in the form of mucosal ferritin and is lost as these cells slough . Ferroportin: It is a transmembrane protein that transports iron from the inside of a cell to the outside of the cell . Ferroportin is the only known iron exporter .
