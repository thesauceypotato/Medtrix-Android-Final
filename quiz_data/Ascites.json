SBP is a common and severe complication of ascites characterized by accidental ascitic fluid infection without an intra - abdominal source. In hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites, SBP can occur in up to 30% of individuals and have a 25 % in-hospital mortality rate. Bacterial translocation is the presumed mechanism for developing SBP, with gut flora traversing the intestine into mesenteric lymph nodes, leading to bacteremia and seeding of the ascites fluid. SBP is diagnosed when the fluid sample has an absolute neutrophil count of > 250 / micro L. In patients with variceal bleeding, the frequency of SBP is significantly increased, and prophylaxis against SBP is recommended when a patient presents with an upper GI bleed. In hospitalized patients with ascites, paracentesis within 12 hours of admission reduces mortality because of early detection of SBP. Cultures of ascitic fluid typically reveal one bacterial pathogen. The presence of multiple pathogens in the setting of an elevated ascitic PMN count suggests secondary peritonitis from a ruptured viscus or abscess. Options A, B, D:</p>\n<p></p>",
