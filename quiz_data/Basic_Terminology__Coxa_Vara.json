Classically, skin dimpling is seen over the tibia. The fibular deficiency can be intercalary , which involves the whole bone (fibula is absent), or terminal. Fibular hemimelia is linked to the sonic hedgehog gene. Radiographic findings: Complete or partial absence of fibula , a ball-and-socket ankle joint (secondary to tarsal coalitions), and deficient lateral rays in the foot Treatment: Varies from a simple shoe lift or bracing to Syme amputation Decisions are based on the degree of foot deformity, the number of rays, and the extent of shortening of the limb. Amputation is usually performed in a patient with a severely shortened limb or a stiff, nonfunctional foot, at about 10 months of age. For less severe cases, reconstructive procedures, including lengthening, may be an alternative. Such a procedure should include resection of the fibular remnant to avoid future foot problems</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B.
