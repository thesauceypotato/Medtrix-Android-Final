In this case, the patient cannot see the left side from both eyes, which means the lesion is in the right occipital lobe. The occipital lobe processes visual information, and a lesion here can result in loss of vision in the corresponding visual field of both eyes.</li><li>\u2022 occipital lobe,</li><li>\u2022 Macular sparing occurs because the macular region of the occipital cortex has a dual blood supply from both the middle cerebral artery and the posterior cerebral artery, providing some redundancy that preserves central vision even when other parts of the occipital lobe are damaged.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
