She has not seen a physician in many years and has no past medical history. Her only medications are a multivitamin and calcium with vitamin D. Her family history is significant for similar symptoms of weakness in her brother who is 2 years older. Her mother, who is 58 years old, was diagnosed with mild weakness after her brother was evaluated but is not symptomatic. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s face appears long and narrow with wasting of the temporalis and masseter muscles. Her speech is mildly dysarthric, and the palate is high and arched. Strength is 4/5 in the intrinsic muscles of the hand, wrist extensors, and ankle dorsiflexors. After testing handgrip strength, you notice that there is a delayed relaxation of the muscles of the hand. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

Her best attempt at creating this test reached an 82% sensitivity and an 88% specificity. She is hoping to increase these values by at least 2% for each value. After several years of work, she believes that she has achieved a sensitivity and specificity that is much greater than what she originally hoped for. She travels to China to test the new blood test. She finds 2,000 patients who are willing to participate in her study. Of the 2,000 patients, 1,200 of them are known to be infected with the EBV virus. The scientist tests blood samples from these 1,200 patients and finds that only 120 of them tested negative with her new test. In addition, of the patients who are known to be EBV-free, only 20 of them tested positive. Given these results, which of the following indicates the specificity of the test?",
