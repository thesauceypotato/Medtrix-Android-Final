      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Laryngeal muscles The first muscles to be blocked by muscle relaxants (both depolarizing and nondepolarizing types) are central muscles i.e., muscles of the head and neck (face, jaw, pharynx, larynx), respiratory (except Diaphragm), abdominal muscles, and muscles of the trunk. After the central muscles, muscles of limbs (peripheral muscles) are blocked. Diaphragm is the most resistant muscle to the effect of muscle relaxants The sequence of recovery is the same; way as they go, the way they come i.e., first to recover are central muscles and then limb muscles.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options B and D- Limb muscles are blocked after central muscles Option C- Normally 70% of the diaphragm block is considered sufficient which gets blocked with other respiratory muscles. Complete diaphragm block needs high doses of muscle relaxants. To conclude it can be said that for clinical purposes diaphragm goes and comes with other muscles but as an isolated muscle it is the most resistant muscle to be blocked</p>\n<p></p>",
