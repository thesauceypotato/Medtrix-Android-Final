      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Bohler Braun Splint Bohler-Braun splint: This is a frame that has several pulleys (1-3) over which the traction cord passes while giving traction for different fractures. It is more convenient than Thomas's splint since it has no ring. The ring of a Thomas splint is a common cause of discomfort, especially in elderly people. A Bohler-Braun splint has no inbuilt system of counteraction, hence it is not suitable for transportation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Bohler Braun splint This splint has got various pulley's which can be used to create pull in different directions. Although it is bulky and cannot be used for transportation of the patient, but it is more convenient than thomas splint as it need not be passed across the limb.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. A Thomas splint is used for immobilization of the lower limb. The ring of the Thomas splint is introduced around the limb. The thigh and leg are supported on slings tied over the sidebars. Option: C. Gallow\u2019s traction is used for fracture shaft of the femur in children less than 2 years of age Option: D. Cramer-wire splint: This splint is used for temporary splinting of fractures during transportation. It is made up of two thick parallel wires with interlacing wires. It can be bent into different shapes to immobilize different parts of the body.</p>\n<p></p>",

Cortical bone screws have a fine pitch; cancellous bone screws have a coarse pitch. The finer the pitch, the more turns the surgeon will have to make to insert the screw and the more turns of the spiral thread engage in a given depth of cortex. Option: D.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All the above statements are true When a limb is painful as a result of inflammation of a joint or a fracture of one of the bones, the controlling muscles contract simultaneously. This is called muscle spasm. The antagonistic muscles in a limb are not all equally powerful, with the result that when muscle spasm is present, the action of the more powerful muscles can produce a deformity that may seriously impair the future function of the limb. Traction, by overcoming muscle spasms, relieves pain and thus allows a limb to be rested in the best available In addition, traction reduces the movement of an injured part of the body and thus aids in the healing of bone and soft tissues. So, traction is done after most of the fractures. Traction is used for- Option A: 1). Reduction of fractures and dislocations and their maintenance Option B. 2). Immobilizing a painful fracture and inflamed joints. Option C. 3). Prevention of deformity by counteracting the muscle spasms 4). Correction of soft tissue contractures by stretching.</p>\n<p></p>",
