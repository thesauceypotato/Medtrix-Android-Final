Bile acid sequestrants (like cholestyramine) effectively reduce diarrhea by binding bile acids to prevent spillage into the colon. Fatty acid diarrhea (Steatorrhea): Passage of large, bulky, and malodorous stools with increased stool fat excretion to > 7% of dietary fat. Reduced recycling of bile acids by the enterohepatic circulation (Ileal diseases or ileal resection) Increased entry into and concentration of bile acids in the colon. Malabsorption due to inadequate bile acid concentrations in the small-bowel lumen.

Resection > 100 cm results in bile acid loss that exceeds liver synthetic capacity, and malabsorption causes diarrhea due to bile acid deficiency.</p>\n<p></p>",

IgA anti-endomysial antibodies are found in 90% coeliac patients. They are a very specific & sensitive marker for coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis. Option: C. Anti-gliadin antibodies can be found in the serum of patients with overt and subclinical coeliac disease and in some controls. Option: D. Reticulin is a term for collagen-containing connective tissues in many organs. Anti-reticulin antibodies may be detected occasionally as part of the autoantibody screen. They are in themselves of no significance. However, in around 50% of cases, they may provide evidence of unsuspected coeliac disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Deamidated antigliadin IgG antibodies or tissue transglutaminase IgG antibodies are detectable and diagnostic in IgA-deficient patients.
