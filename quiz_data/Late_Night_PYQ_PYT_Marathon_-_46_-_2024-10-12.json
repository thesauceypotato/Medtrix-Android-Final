ERP involves gradually exposing patients to their obsessional triggers, such as the fear of contamination, while preventing them from engaging in their usual compulsive rituals, such as hand washing. This process helps reduce the anxiety associated with obsessions and decreases the compulsive behavior over time. ERP directly addresses the core symptoms of OCD by teaching patients to tolerate distress without performing compulsions, making it the most effective therapeutic approach for long-term management of OCD.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) : SSRIs, such as fluoxetine and sertraline, are pharmacological treatments that can help reduce OCD symptoms, especially when combined with ERP. However, they are not as effective as ERP alone in managing the compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts directly and are generally considered adjuncts rather than first-line therapy on their own.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Psychodynamic therapy : Psychodynamic therapy focuses on exploring underlying unconscious conflicts and past experiences that may contribute to a patient\u2019s condition. It is not evidence-based for OCD and does not directly target the compulsions and obsessions that are characteristic of the disorder, making it less effective than ERP.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Psychodynamic therapy</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Antipsychotic medications : Antipsychotics may be used as adjuncts in treatment-resistant OCD when SSRIs and ERP are insufficient.

It is the major pulmonary surfactant (surfactant is a surface-active agent, secreted by type II alveolar epithelial cells) It is a complex mixture of several phospholipids, proteins, and ions. The most important components are the phospholipid dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, surfactant apoproteins, and calcium ions. The surfactant decreases the surface tension in the alveoli 2- to 10-fold, which normally plays a major role in preventing alveolar collapse. However, in a number of conditions, such as in hyaline membrane disease (also called respiratory distress syndrome), which often occurs in newborn premature babies, the quantity of surfactant secreted by the alveoli is so greatly depressed that the surface tension of the alveolar fluid becomes several times normal. This causes a serious tendency for the lungs of these babies to collapse or to become filled with fluid. Clinical relevance - Test to assess fetal lung maturity is L/S ratio \u2013lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio. A ratio of \u2265 2 is considered normal.</li><li>\u2022 Respiratory distress syndrome is due to the deficiency of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidyl-choline (DPPC) /dipalmitoyl lecithin.

This condition often occurs in the context of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, dementia, or following brain trauma. The defining feature is the persistent belief in the replacement of loved ones despite clear evidence to the contrary, leading to significant distress and interpersonal conflict.

This condition often arises from an underlying anxiety disorder, such as social anxiety, where the child feels excessively self-conscious or fearful in certain environments. The behavior is not due to a lack of language skills or developmental issues, and the child typically has normal verbal communication abilities in familiar settings.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Social anxiety disorder : While selective mutism is related to social anxiety, social anxiety disorder itself does not specifically cause selective mutism. Instead, it involves a broader pattern of fear and avoidance of social interactions and performance situations, not limited to speech alone.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Social anxiety disorder</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Autism spectrum disorder : Autism spectrum disorder often involves significant communication difficulties, but these are usually pervasive across all settings, not limited to specific situations like in selective mutism. Children with autism also have other social and behavioral challenges not seen in selective mutism.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Autism spectrum disorder</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) : ADHD is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, but it does not typically include selective mutism or significant anxiety around speaking in specific situations. It primarily affects concentration and behavior control rather than selective communication.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

It is most commonly associated with underlying social anxiety and requires early intervention, including behavioral therapy, to help the child overcome the fear of speaking in specific social situations. Understanding this disorder is crucial in differentiating it from other communication or developmental disorders.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
