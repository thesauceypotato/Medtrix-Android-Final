Parathyroid hormone is a major regulator of calcium and phosphate levels in the blood. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates bone resorption by acting directly on osteoblasts/stromal cells and then indirectly to increase differentiation and function of osteoclasts.

Osteoclastic activity at the tension site. True. In bone remodeling, there is osteoclastic activity at the tension site. Osteoclasts help in reshaping the bone in response to mechanical forces. In contrast to compression, sites under tension (pulling forces) often experience bone resorption. For example, in bone growth and remodeling, bone might be resorbed on one side of a bone to allow for appositional growth on the other side, or to reshape bone in response to tensile forces. This is a normal part of how bone adapts and reshapes.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Osteoclastic activity at the tension site.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Osteoclastic activity and osteoblastic activity are both needed for bone remodelling in cortical and cancellous bones . True. Bone remodeling involves a balance between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts. Both activities are essential for maintaining bone strength and structure, regardless of whether the bone is cortical or cancellous. Osteoclasts resorb old bone, creating cavities, and then osteoblasts fill these cavities with new bone.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Osteoclastic activity and osteoblastic activity are both needed for bone remodelling in cortical and cancellous bones</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Osteoblasts transform into osteocytes. True. Osteoblasts are bone-forming cells responsible for synthesizing new bone tissue. As they become embedded in the bone matrix they produce, they differentiate into osteocytes, which are mature bone cells, and play crucial roles in bone maintenance, mechanosensation, and signaling.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

A traction-counter-traction technique is used under sedation and analgesia cover. The patient is kept in prone with the forearm dangling by the side. A downward traction is applied over the olecranon process while maintaining the elbow flexion.

For posterior dislocation reduction, slightly plantarflex the foot and distract the heel axially while maintaining the counter-traction. While maintaining the axial distraction, apply a counterforce to the ankle anteriorly, dorsiflex the foot and reposition the ankle joint. For anterior dislocation reduction, first dorsiflex the foot to distract talus and then apply axial traction and push foot backwards while maintaining the counter-traction to the posterior part of the leg. For lateral dislocation reduction, distract the heel axially, move the foot medially and dorsiflex it. Post-reduction, a long leg posterior splint with 90\u2070 foot dorsiflexion is applied.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Ankle dislocation.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Knee dislocation.

Fractures of the humeral shaft in elderly individuals may present challenges due to factors such as osteoporosis, decreased bone density, and associated medical conditions.

Radial nerve involvement after manipulation. The radial nerve travels along the humerus, and fractures of the humeral shaft can potentially injure or compress the radial nerve. If there is evidence of radial nerve involvement, such as weakness or sensory deficits in the distribution of the nerve, surgical exploration and intervention may be required to address the nerve injury, restore function, and prevent long-term disability.</li><li>\u2022 2.</li><li>\u2022 Radial nerve involvement after manipulation.</li><li>\u2022 \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b3. Pathological fractures. Pathological fractures occur as a result of underlying bone pathology, such as tumors or metastatic lesions. These fractures can be associated with significant instability and may not heal properly with conservative management alone. Surgical stabilization of the fracture can help provide structural support, relieve pain, and prevent further complications associated with the underlying pathology.</li><li>\u2022 \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b3.</li><li>\u2022 Pathological fractures.</li><li>\u2022 Pathological fractures.</li><li>\u2022 \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b4. Vascular injury. While vascular injury is not a direct indication for surgical management of a fracture shaft of the humerus, it is a serious complication that may require surgical intervention. Fractures associated with vascular injury may result in compromised blood flow to the arm, leading to ischemia and tissue damage. Surgical exploration and repair of the vascular injury may be necessary to restore blood flow and prevent complications such as compartment syndrome or limb loss.</li><li>\u2022 \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b4.</li><li>\u2022 Vascular injury.</li><li>\u2022 \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b5 . Multiple fractures. Fractures of the humeral shaft can occur in isolation or in combination with other fractures, especially in cases of high-energy trauma. Multiple fractures increase the complexity of management and may require surgical intervention to address each fracture adequately. Surgery can help stabilize the fractures, facilitate healing, and restore function to the affected limb.</li><li>\u2022 \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b5</li><li>\u2022 Multiple fractures.</li><li>\u2022 Educational objective:</li><li>\u2022 Educational objective:</li><li>\u2022 Indications for surgical management of a fracture shaft of the humerus include fractures in elderly individuals, radial nerve involvement after manipulation, pathological fractures, vascular injury, and multiple fractures.

Trans scaphoid-perilunate disruption fracture . It is caused by high-energy trauma and result from an axial load applied to the outstretched hand. Load application to the fixed pronated forearm leads to hyperextension, intercarpal supination, and ulnar deviation of the wrist. There is pain and swelling over the hand and wrist, and gross deformity of the wrist can be noted. Evidence of median nerve injury is common. Acute carpal tunnel syndrome is observed.

Compound palmar ganglion, also known as chronic flexor tenosynovitis , is a condition involving the flexor tendons around the wrist, above and below the flexor retinaculum. Most common etiologies are tuberculosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment of choice for such conditions include complete excision of the mass along with the radical synovectomy of the wrist joint and associated flexor tendon sheaths followed by anti-tubercular medications. With early diagnosis and treatment good recovery can be achieved.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Compound palmar ganglion</li><li>\u2022 chronic flexor tenosynovitis</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Tenosynovitis . Infectious tenosynovitis treatment can include broad-spectrum antibiotics such as vancomycin at 15 to 20 mg/kg/dose every 8 to 12 hours with a third-generation cephalosporin at 1 to 2 g IV every 24 hours. Non-infectious tenosynovitis is treated conservatively with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen. Additional first-line treatment may consist of activity modification, splinting, and glucocorticoid injections. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as glucocorticoids may be additionally helpful in patients in patients who fail a trial of NSAIDs. Surgical intervention may become necessary after 3 to 6 months of progression despite conservative therapy. Surgical intervention may involve the decompression of affected tendons as well as debridement of inflammatory tissues.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Tenosynovitis</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Osteoarthritis of first CMC joint . Activity modification, or using splints, slings, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cortisol injections are all examples of conservative treatment. Surgical options include osteotomy, trapezial excision, ligament reconstruction with or without tendon interposition, and various prosthetic interpositional implants with or without trapezial excision.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
