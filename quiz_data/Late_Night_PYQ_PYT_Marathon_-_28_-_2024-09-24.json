NADPH donates hydrogen atoms during the reduction steps required to build carbon chains, particularly in the enzymatic actions of ketoacyl-ACP reductase and enoyl-ACP reductase during de novo fatty acid synthesis.

Niacin can induce insulin resistance and reduce glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, potentially leading to hyperglycemia. This effect is particularly concerning in patients with diabetes, even those with well-controlled blood sugar levels. Therefore, niacin should be used cautiously in diabetic patients, and their blood glucose should be monitored closely, especially in the initial weeks of therapy to ensure that blood sugar levels remain within a safe range.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 A.

Michaelis-Menten kinetics describes enzyme activity where the reaction velocity increases with substrate concentration but eventually plateaus as the enzyme becomes saturated with substrate. The key points of Michaelis-Menten kinetics include Vmax, the maximum reaction velocity when the enzyme is fully saturated, and Km, the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of Vmax.
