Oedema : increased volume of fluid in the skin and soft tissues of the leg. Commonly starts distally and moves more proximally with increasing venous dysfunction. Classically this is \u2018 pitting oedema \u2019 , with firm digital pressure leaving an indentation in the soft tissues. Eczema : an erythematous dermatitis, often appears minor, although it may be associated with significant itching and discomfort. Pigmentation (haemosiderosis): a brownish discoloration of the skin, usually permanent. It is usually seen around the ankle, but is also seen in proximity to varicose veins and incompetent perforators. Lipodermatosclerosis (LDS): chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, resulting in a tight, contracted, \u2018 woody \u2019 leg on examination. Atrophie blanche : localised areas of atrophic, white skin, often surrounded by telangiectasia and pigmentation. Venous ulcer : full-thickness skin loss, usually around the ankle, which fails to heal spontaneously and is propagated by continuing venous hypertension and the changes associated with chronic venous disease.</li><li>\u27a4 Varicose vein : subcutaneous dilated vein 3 mm in diameter or larger.

The lateral portion of the implant, which was traditionally left in the subcutaneous plane, is now increasingly covered by an acellular dermal matrix (ADM). This gives a superior cosmetic result. If the skin at the mastectomy site is poor (e.g. following radiotherapy) or if a larger volume of tissue is required , a musculocutaneous flap can be constructed either from the pedicled latissimus dorsi muscle (an LD flap) or using the transversus abdominis muscle (a pedicled TRAM flap). The latter gives an excellent cosmetic result in experienced hands but is a lengthy procedure and requires careful patient selection. It is now usually performed as a free transfer using microvascular anastomosis, although the pedicled TRAM from the contralateral side is still used. Variations on the TRAM flap requiring less muscle harvesting, such as the free DIEP flap (based on deep inferior epigastric vessels), are increasingly being used. As muscle is spared, post operative hernias are uncommon in DIEP flap.</li><li>\u27a4 The easiest type of reconstruction is using a silicone gel implant under the pectoralis major muscle.

STSG does not contain intact myocytes and thereby undergoes secondary contracture with an unsightly scar. Skin grafts inevitably contract, with the extent of contracture determined by the amount of dermis taken with the graft and the level of postoperative splintage and physiotherapy applied to the grafted site. Full-thickness skin grafts consist of epidermis and dermis . As they include the entire thickness of the dermis, they retain their elasticity and are less prone to secondary scar contracture . However, this also means that the area harvested is limited by the ability to primarily close the donor site. The common sites for harvest include the supraclavicular skin, groin crease and posterior auricular region (known as a Wolfe graft), where there is adequate skin laxity. Full-thickness grafts are commonly used for syndactyly release in the hand, reconstruction of facial defects following skin cancer excision or contracture releases following burns. Composite skin grafts are a combination of skin and another tissue type , such as fat or cartilage . A commonly used composite skin graft is to harvest a skin/cartilage graft from the helical root of the ear to reconstruct the alar of the nose following skin cancer excision. A hair-bearing composite scalp graft can be used to reconstruct an eyebrow.</li><li>\u27a4 Full thickness skin graft contains myocytes and thereby undergoes primary contracture.</li><li>\u27a4 Full thickness skin graft</li><li>\u27a4 myocytes</li><li>\u27a4 undergoes primary contracture.</li><li>\u27a4 STSG does not contain intact myocytes and thereby undergoes secondary contracture with an unsightly scar.</li><li>\u27a4 STSG does not contain intact myocytes</li><li>\u27a4 undergoes secondary contracture</li><li>\u27a4 Skin grafts inevitably contract, with the extent of contracture determined by the amount of dermis taken with the graft and the level of postoperative splintage and physiotherapy applied to the grafted site.</li><li>\u27a4 Full-thickness skin grafts consist of epidermis and dermis .
