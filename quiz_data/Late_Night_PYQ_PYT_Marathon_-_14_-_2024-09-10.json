A) Anovulation</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Anovulation is the most common cause of puberty menorrhagia. Menorrhagia refers to heavy menstrual bleeding that occurs in a regular cycle. In adolescents, anovulation, which is the failure of the ovary to release an oocyte during a menstrual cycle, frequently leads to heavy or prolonged bleeding due to the lack of a normal hormonal cycle that regulates the endometrial lining. Without the usual cyclical hormonal fluctuations, the endometrial lining may become excessively thick, leading to heavy bleeding when it sheds. This condition is typical in puberty due to the body's ongoing adjustment to hormonal regulation.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Endometriosis : Endometriosis involves the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which can cause painful menstruation and potentially contribute to menorrhagia. However, it is less common than anovulation as the primary cause of menorrhagia in adolescents.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Endometriosis</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Malignancy : Malignancy is a rare cause of menorrhagia in puberty. While malignancy can lead to abnormal bleeding, it is not the most common cause in this age group.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

Elevated GH levels result in increased production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is responsible for the characteristic features of acromegaly when these hormones are overproduced after the closure of growth plates. Acromegaly manifests with overgrowth of the skin, soft tissues, and viscera, including the thyroid, heart, and liver. The bones of the face, hands, and feet become thickened and enlarged, leading to a distinct appearance with prognathism and broadening of the lower face. Additional systemic complications include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, and an increased risk of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options</li><li>\u2022 Other Options</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Fixation is a crucial step in preparing blood smears as it preserves the cellular architecture by denaturing proteins and adhering cells, including parasites, firmly to the slide. This fixation prevents the cells from washing away during subsequent staining steps and maintains their morphology, allowing for accurate visualization under the microscope.
