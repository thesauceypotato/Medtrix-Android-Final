B) HCG from placenta</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 HCG from placenta : HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) from the placenta stimulates the production of testosterone in the male fetus. HCG released from the placenta is the initial stimulus for testosterone production in the male fetus. Later by the eighth week of gestation, fetal pituitary LH (luteinizing hormone) stimulates the Leydig cells of the testes to produce testosterone. Sex differentiation of the embryo depends on the Y chromosome, which contains the testis-determining gene called the SRY (sex-determining region on Y) gene.

It typically occurs after delivery or abortion and is often seen in women with risk factors like cesarean section, prolonged labor, or pelvic infection.</li><li>\u2022 The fever in SPT is caused by a septic thrombus in the pelvic veins\u2014most commonly the ovarian vein\u2014that harbors bacteria and incites a sustained inflammatory response. Since antibiotics alone cannot fully penetrate the infected thrombus, the addition of anticoagulation (usually low molecular weight heparin) is essential. Heparin helps in lysing the thrombus, preventing further propagation and improving antibiotic penetration.</li><li>\u2022 Clinical improvement is usually seen within 48\u201372 hours of initiating combined therapy with antibiotics and heparin.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

This is why free T3 and free T4 are preferred for thyroid function testing during pregnancy. TSH: The levels of TSH may decrease slightly in the first trimester due to the thyrotropic effects of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), but they generally stabilize in the second and third trimesters.

This means that as the distance from the radiation source increases, the intensity of the radiation decreases exponentially. This law is fundamental in radiation physics and is crucial for understanding radiation exposure and protection.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Small blood vessels are most radioresistant: This is incorrect. Larger vessels are more radioresistant compared to smaller ones.

Small blood vessels are most radioresistant:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Rapidly proliferating cells are most radioresistant: This is incorrect. Rapidly proliferating cells are the most radiosensitive. Cells that are dividing quickly, such as those in the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, and reproductive tissues, are more susceptible to radiation damage because radiation primarily affects DNA during cell division.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including the small bowel, is among the most radiosensitive organ systems in the body.
