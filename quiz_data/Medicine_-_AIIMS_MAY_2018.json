Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which is transient and typically precipitated by acute, unexpected emotional or physical stress, is also known as \u201cstress cardiomyopathy\u201d or \u201cbroken-heart syndrome. The apical ballooning syndrome, or stress-induced cardiomyopathy occurs typically in older women after sudden intense emotional or physical stress. The ventricle shows global ventricular dilation with basal contraction, forming the shape of the It is increasingly recognized elsewhere during emergency cardiac catheterization and intensive care unit admissions for non cardiac conditions.

The left ventricular dysfunction extends beyond a specific coronary artery distribution and generally resolves within days to weeks. This acute cardiomyopathy may result from intense sympathetic activation with heterogeneity of myocardial autonomic innervation, diffuse microvascular spasm, and/or direct catecholamine toxicity. Coronary angiography may be required to rule out acute coronary occlusion. No therapies have been proven beneficial, but reasonable strategies include:- Nitrates for pulmonary edema, intra aortic balloon pump if needed for low output, combined alpha and beta blockers rather than selective beta blockade if hemodynamically stable, magnesium for arrhythmias related to QT prolongation. Anticoagulation is generally withheld due to the occasional occurrence of ventricular rupture. While the prognosis is generally good, recurrences have been described in up to 10% of patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Modified Mayo Clinic criteria LV regional wall-motion abnormalities - Absence of coronary lesion ECG abnormalities OR \u2191 troponin levels Absence of pheochromocytoma and myocarditis Diagnostic hints ST-segment elevation T-wave inversion \u2191 Cardiac enzyme levels \u2193 LVEF Close prior stressful event Faster recovery Symptoms Chest pain Dyspnea Palpitations Syncope Cardiogenic Shock</p>\n<p></p>",

Multinucleated giant cells, T lymphocytes, plasma cells, mast cells and eosinophils may also be seen at the periphery.

Treatment: Glucocorticoid alone is effective in this disease. In case of multisystem involvement -cyclophosphamid e and prednisolone followed by azathioprine or methotrexate is used. Mepolizumab is an anti IL-5 antibody.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA PCM P-ANCA Churg Strauss Vasculitis Microscopic Polyangiitis C-ANCA:- Wegener's Granulomatosis</p>\n<p></p>",

The main components of NARP syndrome are: Neuropathy (peripheral neuropathy which mostly affects nerves) Ataxia Retinitis pigmentosa Other features include seizures, hearing loss and cardiac conduction defects, and sensory neuropathy It occurs due to a mutation in the MT-ATP6 gene, which results in altered structure or function of mitochondrial ATP synthase leading to decreased ATP production. As it involves a mutation of mitochondrial DNA, it is inherited from mother to child (maternal inheritance). Other maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA disorders include: Leigh syndrome, Leber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS).</p>\n<p></p>",

The increased fluid pressure immediately transmitted throughout the system normally can be demonstrated with a manometer attached to a lumbar puncture needle.

Usually it is present in axilla, groin region. Infectious agents Rickettsial infections are caused by various bacterial species from the genera Rickettsia, Orientia, Ehrlichia, Neorickettsia, Neo Ehrlichia, and Anaplasma . Rickettsia spp. are classically divided into the typhus group and spotted fever group (SFG). Orientia make up the scrub typhus group. The rickettsial pathogens most likely to be encountered during travel outside the United States include africae (African tick-bite fever), R. conorii (Mediterranean spotted fever), R. rickettsii (known as both Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Brazilian spotted fever), O.

Inhaling or inoculating conjunctiva with infectious material may also cause infection for some of these organisms. Transmission of some rickettsial diseases after transfusion or organ transplantation is rare but has been reported.
