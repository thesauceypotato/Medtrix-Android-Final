A single clinical and mammographic lesion measuring 4 cm or less without signs of local advancement (T1, T2, < 4 cm), with no extensive nodal involvement (NO, N1) or metastasis (M0). > 4 cm may also be treated by breast conserving surgery in patients with large breast. In case of small breasts even smaller tumours may require mastectomy</li><li>\u2022 (ii) There is no age limit. Primary systemic chemotherapy may reduce size of large tumours to allow such surgery Contraindications of breast conservation surgery are-Tumours> 4 cm in size (T4), extensive nodal metastasis (N2) with distant metastasis (M1), Fixity of tumour with underlying muscles or overlying skin, multicentricity of the tumour which is determined by mammography, central lesions when nipple has to be sacrificed, poor tumour differentiation, multifocal disease, local recurrence, patient preference. Relative contraindications are-young patient (under 35 years), extensive ductal carcinoma-in-situ and widespread lymphatic invasion.</li><li>\u2022 Local recurrence is more common in younger women and in those with high-grade tumours and involved resection margins.</li><li>\u2022 ?    The presence of metastatic disease within the axillary lymph nodes remains the best single marker for prognosis; although treatment of the axilla not affect long-term survival, indicating that the axillary nodes act not as a 'reservoir for disease but as a marker for metastatic potential.</li><li>\u2022 ?    Axillary surgery should not be combined with radiotherapy to the axilla because of excess morbidity</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
