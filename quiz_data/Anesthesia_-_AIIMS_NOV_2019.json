      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Immediate cardioversion Unstable SVT should be managed by immediate cardioversion while stable SVT can be managed by medical therapy. Management: Check for Responsiveness: First, ensure your safety. If the patient is in a potentially dangerous environment, move them to a safe location. Check if the patient is responsive by tapping their shoulders and shouting loudly, \"Are you okay?\" If they do not respond, they are unconscious. Activate Emergency Services: If the patient is unconscious, immediately call 911 or your local emergency number to request professional medical assistance. Provide your location and inform them that you have an unconscious SVT patient. Perform Basic Life Support (BLS): If the patient is not breathing or not breathing normally (gasping), initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) immediately. This involves chest compressions and rescue breaths. If you are trained in CPR, follow the recommended guidelines for your region. If you are not trained in CPR, the emergency dispatcher can provide instructions over the phone. Automated External Defibrillator (AED): If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available, follow the AED's prompts for using it. AEDs can analyze the heart rhythm and may advise a shock if a shockable rhythm is detected. Monitor Vital Signs: While awaiting the arrival of emergency services, monitor the patient's vital signs, if possible. Pay attention to the pulse and breathing rate. Be prepared to continue CPR if necessary.</p>\n<p></p>",
