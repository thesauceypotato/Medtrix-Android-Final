      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pulmonary edema Lung compliance is defined as the ease with which the lungs are expanded and is calculated as the change in volume per change in pressure (\u2206V/\u2206P), which is the slope of the pressure-volume curve of the lung. Thus, Curve Z is the pressure-volume curve of an individual with a decrease in lung compliance. The abnormal accumulation of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) causes a restrictive pulmonary impairment characterized by decreased lung compliance. An L/S ratio \u22652 indicates normal biochemical maturation of the lung, with normal surfactant production and lung compliance (normal curve). If the L/S ratio is less than 2, there is an increased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in the newborn, which would be represented by Curve Z.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>In fibrosis the lungs become stiff, making a large pressure necessary to maintain a moderate volume. Such lungs would be considered poorly compliant. However, in emphysema, where many alveolar walls are lost, the lungs become so loose and floppy that only a small pressure difference is necessary to maintain a large volume. Thus, the lungs in emphysema would be considered highly compliant.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. Emphysema & C. Dyspnea: with aging: Aging and emphysema are characterized by an increase in lung compliance (Curve X), which increases airway resistance. Option B . Asthma: The increase in airway resistance in asthma is not associated with an increase (or decrease) in lung compliance.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>A decrease in airway resistance When airway resistance is high, the respiratory muscles have to work harder to move air in and out of the lungs. This increased work of breathing can lead to an increase in oxygen consumption by the respiratory muscles, which can contribute to dyspnea on exertion. Therefore airway resistance is decreased, and the work of breathing will be reduced, which can decrease the oxygen consumption of the respiratory muscles. This can help to alleviate dyspnea on exertion.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Respiratory muscles consume oxygen in proportion to the work of breathing. The work of breathing is equal to the product of the change in volume for each breath and the change in pressure necessary to overcome the resistive work of breathing and the elastic work of breathing.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Increased FRC; Increased Residual Volume Increased FRC; Increased Residual Volume is true in the case of asthma. In asthma, there is an obstruction of the airways due to inflammation and bronchospasm, which can lead to air trapping in the lungs. This results in an increase in functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a normal expiration, and an increase in residual volume (RV), which is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal expiration.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction, which can lead to increased airway resistance and reduced airflow. During an asthma attack or exacerbation, the airways become narrowed, making it harder for air to flow in and out of the lungs. As a result of this narrowing, the volume of air that remains in the lungs after a maximal exhalation, known as residual volume, increases. The increased airway resistance also causes air to be trapped in the lungs at the end of a normal exhalation, leading to an increase in functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the volume of air that remains in the lungs at the end of a normal breath. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Increased FRC; Increased Residual Volume.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A is not correct in the case of asthma. An increased FRC is seen in asthma due to air trapping caused by bronchospasm and inflammation of the airways. Option C is not correct in the case of asthma. Option C is incorrect as it suggests a reduced FRC and a reduced residual volume, which is not consistent with the pathophysiology of asthma. Option D is not correct in the case of asthma. Asthma is characterized by airway obstruction due to inflammation and bronchospasm, which leads to air trapping and an increase in the amount of air that remains in the lungs after a normal expiration . This results in an increase in the functional residual capacity ( FRC ) and an increase in the residual volume ( RV ).</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>In diseases with airway obstruction, it is usually much more difficult to expire than to inspire because the closing tendency of the airways is greatly increased by the extra positive pressure required in the chest to cause expiration. By contrast, the extra negative pleural pressure that occurs during inspiration actually \u201cpulls\u201d the airways open at the same time that it expands the alveoli. Therefore, air tends to enter the lung easily but then becomes trapped in the lungs. Over a period of months or years, this effect increases both the TLC and the RV. The classic disease that causes severe airway obstruction is asthma.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Obstructive lung diseases Obstruction of air flow (\u2020 FRC, \u2191 RV, \u2191 TLC) \u2192\nair trapping in lungs with premature airway closure at high lung volumes (\u2193\u2193\nFEV,, \u2193 FVC \u2193 FEV/FVC ratio).

The FEV1 and FVC values indicate that Mr. Jitendra has an obstructive pattern of lung disease.
