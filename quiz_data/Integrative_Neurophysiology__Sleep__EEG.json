The affected individual experiences a sudden loss of voluntary muscle tone (cataplexy), an eventual irresistible urge to sleep during the daytime, and possibly brief episodes of total paralysis at the beginning or end of sleep. Narcolepsy is also characterized by a sudden onset of REM sleep, unlike normal sleep which begins with non-REM, slow-wave sleep. Narcolepsy has a familial incidence strongly associated with a class II antigen of the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6 at the HLA-DR2 or HLA-DQW1 locus, implying a genetic susceptibility to narcolepsy. The HLA complex may increase susceptibility to an immune attack on the neurons producing Orexin in Hypothalamus, leading to their degeneration. Polysomnography also called a sleep study, is a comprehensive test used to diagnose sleep disorders. Polysomnography records your brain waves, the oxygen level in your blood, heart rate and breathing, as well as eye and leg movements during the study.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A. The noradrenergic nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) is a tiny cluster of cells located bilaterally in the pons just under the fourth ventricle. Option: B. The raphe nucleus is considered to be part of the reticular formation and is located in the brainstem. It is responsible for the release of serotonin to other parts of the brain. Option: C. In the brain adenosine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. This means adenosine can act as a central nervous system depressant. In normal conditions, it promotes sleep and suppresses arousal.</p>\n<p></p>",

The locus coeruleus is a small area located bilaterally and posteriorly at the juncture between the pons and mesencephalon. Nerve fibers from this area spread throughout the brain, and they secrete norepinephrine. Norepinephrine generally excites the brain to increase activity. However, it has inhibitory effects in a few brain areas because of inhibitory receptors at certain neuronal synapses. This system probably plays an important role in causing dreaming, thus leading to a type of sleep called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A. The amygdala is anatomically connected with and functionally modulates the brainstem centers involved in arousal and sleep regulation.

It is near the bottom of the fourth ventricle. The locus coeruleus is now thought to be the primary site of norepinephrine production in the brain. The nucleus sends norepinephrine throughout the cerebral cortex as well as to other systems such as the cerebellum, amygdala, spinal cord, and hippocampus These nerve cells have frequently expanded axons that project through the neuraxis and are the only source of norepinephrine to the neocortex, cerebellum, most of the thalamus region, and the hippocampus. The locus coeruleus (or \u201cblue spot\u201d) interacts with the amygdala, a group of cells near the brain responsible for the emotional It is the primary source of noradrenaline, a neurotransmitter in the brain. The norepinephrine (NE) locus coeruleus (LC) framework is implicated in the control of waking and sleeping processes. Stimulation of the locus coeruleus helps promote wakefulness. Neuromelanin-containing cells in the locus coeruleus start to degrade significantly in Parkinson\u2019s disease. In Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), the locus coeruleus deteriorates in the very early stages of disease progression, resulting in a gradual deterioration of noradrenaline nerve fibers of the neocortex and hippocampus.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Alpha waves Alpha waves are rhythmic waves that occur at frequencies between 8 and 13 cycles/sec and are found in the EEGs of almost all healthy adults when they are awake and in a quiet, resting state of cerebration. These waves occur most intensely in the occipital region but can also be recorded from the parietal and frontal regions of the scalp. Their voltage is usually about 50 microvolts. During deep sleep, the alpha waves disappear.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Alpha rhythm: In adult humans who are awake but at rest with the mind wandering and the eyes closed, a fairly regular pattern of waves at a frequency of 8-13 Hz and amplitude of 50-100 V is recorded on EEG. Most prominent on parietal and occipital associated with decreased levels of attention. Beta waves: When attention is focused on something, the alpha rhythm is replaced by an irregular beta rhythm. It is a 13-30 Hz low-voltage activity. This phenomenon is called alpha block and can be produced by any form of sensory stimulation or mental concentration, such as solving arithmetic problems. Another term for this phenomenon is the arousal or alerting response because it is correlated with the aroused, alert state. It has also been called desynchronization because it represents the breaking up of the obviously synchronized neural activity necessary to produce regular waves. EEG DURING SLEEP Stage 1 NREM sleep is the transition from wakefulness to sleep, the EEG theta rhythm (4-7 Hz). Stage 2 of NREM sleep is marked by the appearance of sinusoidal waves called sleep spindles (7-15 Hz) and occasional high voltage biphasic waves called K complexes. Stage 3 of NREM sleep is characterized by the appearance of a high-amplitude delta rhythm (0.5-4 Hz) in the EEG, associated with a further reduction in arousal, and a further reduction in muscle tone. Stage 4 of non-REM sleep Deep sleep pattern of rhythmic high amplitude slow waves-Delta waves (indicative of marked synchronization of cortical and thalamic activity) is sometimes referred to as slow-wave sleep. While the occurrence of theta and delta rhythms is normal during sleep, their appearance during wakefulness is a sign of brain dysfunction (focal brain damage).</p>\n<p></p>",

The peak incidence occurs between 3 and 6 years of age. Developmental, genetic, psychological, and organic factors have been identified as causes of nightmares. Nightmares usually occur in the middle of the night or in the early morning when rapid eye movement sleep is more common. The content of the nightmare almost always involves a specific danger to the person. On awakening, the child is fully alert and can usually recall the details of the nightmare. Sporadic nightmares are common in children and require reassurance only. If nightmares are frequent and persistent, a psychological evaluation of the patient and family is indicated. Although sporadic nightmares may be normal responses to stress, chronic nightmares can be troublesome. Night terrors are most commonly associated with medication or illness in childhood. Post-traumatic stress disorder produces recurrent and repetitive nightmares. Also remember: REM sleep has several important characteristics: It is an active form of sleep usually associated with dreaming and active bodily muscle movements. The person is even more difficult to arouse by sensory stimuli than during deep slow-wave sleep, and yet people usually awaken spontaneously in the morning during an episode of REM sleep. Muscle tone throughout the body is exceedingly depressed, indicating strong inhibition of the spinal muscle control areas. Heart rate and the respiratory rate usually become irregular, which is characteristic of the dream state. Night terrors: Night terrors are a sleep disorder, resulting from partial arousal during slow-wave sleep (NREM Sleep). They usually occur within 2 hours of sleep onset and are characterized by agitation and unresponsiveness to external stimuli. Night terrors are bizarre sleep disorder that affects young children. The child partially awakes during the night agitated, afraid, and terrified, and cannot be consoled. The child cannot usually recall the events in the dream.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Other Options are not correct because Nightmare syndrome involves dreams during REM sleep.</p>\n<p></p>",

Nuclei in both the brainstem and hypothalamus are critical for the transitions between these states of consciousness. Damage to the area produces a comatose state. Electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus also produces arousal similar to that elicited by stimulation of the midbrain, while electrical stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus and adjacent basal forebrain region induces sleep. A variety of physiological functions, such as alertness (the sleep-wake cycle), body temperature, and secretion of hormones, exhibit cyclic activity that varies over a 24-h period called circadian rhythms and are controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Option:- Option: A. The thalamus has a nonphotic influence on sleep, circadian rhythmicity, pineal melatonin production, and secretion. Option: C. The putamen is involved in learning and motor control, including speech articulation, language functions, reward, cognitive functioning, and addiction. Option: D. Strong activation of limbic regions during REM sleep suggests a role in the regulation of emotion.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The paraventricular nucleus secretes oxytocin and vasopressin, The ventromedial and lateral nuclei control food intake The arcuate nucleus secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Jet Lag Disorder: The syndrome is transient, typically lasting 2-14 d depending on the number of time zones crossed, the direction of travel, and the traveler's age and phase-shifting capacity. Travelers who spend more time outdoors at their destination reportedly adapt more quickly than those who remain in hotel or seminar rooms, presumably due to brighter (outdoor) light exposure. Avoidance of antecedent sleep loss or napping in the afternoon before overnight travel can reduce the difficulties associated with extended wakefulness. Low doses of Melatonin are shown to be helpful in preclinical studies. Social jet lag: Bedtimes and wake times on weekends or days off occur 4-8 h later than during the week. Such recurrent displacement of the timing of the sleep-wake cycle is common in adolescents and young adults and is associated with a delayed circadian phase, sleep-onset insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, poorer academic performance, and increased risk of both obesity and depressive symptoms.</p>\n<p></p>",
