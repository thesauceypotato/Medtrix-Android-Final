      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Terbinafine</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Itraconazole inhibits 14-\u03b1-sterol demethylase Terbinafine inhibits fungal squalene epoxidase, blocking ergosterol biosynthesis. Increased intracellular Squalene also impairs cell growth. It acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of 'squalene epoxidase,' an early-step enzyme that generates squalene epoxide converted to lanosterol and then to ergosterol by fungi. Accumulation of squalene within the fungal cells is responsible for the fungicidal action. The mammalian enzyme is inhibited only by a 1000-fold higher concentration of terbinafine.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication. It is used in the treatment of severe fungal infections and kala-azar. It kills fungi by destroying the fungal cell membrane. Option : B. Caspofungin is a lipopeptide antifungal drug from Merck & Co., Inc., discovered by James Balkovec, Regina Black, and Frances A. Bouffard. It is a member of a new class of antifungals termed the echinocandins. Option: C . Itraconazole belongs to a group of medicines called antifungals. It works by stopping the growth of fungus and is used to treat infections of the mouth, throat, vagina, and other body parts, including fingernails and toenails. It kills fungi by destroying the fungal cell membrane.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>TERBINAFINE MOA: Terbinafine inhibits the fungal enzyme squalene epoxidase. This leads to the accumulation of the sterol squalene, which is toxic to the organism. ADR: - Adverse effects are rare, - rare, consisting primarily of gastrointestinal upset and headache. - Topical terbinafine can cause erythema, itching, dryness, irritation, urticaria and rashes. Dose: One tablet given daily for 12 weeks achieves a cure rate of up to 90% for onychomycosis and is more effective than griseofulvin or itraconazole.</p>\n<p></p>",
