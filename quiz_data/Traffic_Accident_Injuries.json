      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Mesentery Seat Belt Injuries: Seat belts are of the lap strap and diagonal shoulder type, which are of the \"inertial reel\" type, which allows slow movement but jams at a sudden tug. They are less effective than three-point Small intestine avulsions, intestinal, omental, and mesenteric lacerations, and intestinal contusion and perforations occur, known as \"seat belt syndrome,\" due to acute flexion over a lap strap. The spleen, liver, pancreas, caecum, and bladder rupture occurs due to compression between the belt and vertebrae. Abrasions, contusions, and hematomas of the lower abdomen and chest wall can directly result from seat belt trauma. The abdominal aorta can be crushed. Transverse lumbar vertebrae fractures, usually at the second or third segment of the interspace, can occur due to acute trunk hyperflexion over the belt fulcrum. The posterior arch, pedicle, or transverse processes may be fractured.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A, C, & D. Spleen, Liver, and aorta may be crushed in a seat belt injury, but they are not the most likely Injured part of the body. Hence there are better answers than these three options.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation_images": [],
      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Windshield glass injury Multiple, short linear, angular, rectangular, and square, punctate lacerations of the face are produced due to the shattering of the windscreen glass into multiple small rectangular, square, or cubical fragments with relatively blunt edges (\"sparrow foot\" marks; dicing injuries). They are relatively superficial. Thin pieces of windscreen glass may be embedded in the wounds or found loose in the clothing. There may be partial avulsion of the skin.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Gunshot injuries don't cause minor lacerations rather it causes deep wound. Option: B. Vitriolage is the throwing of acid on a person. It doesn't produce minor lacerations but rather more significant Option: C. Stab injury causes a deeper cut wound than minor Hence it is not the correct answer.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Skull divided into two halves Hinge fracture - The skull's base is divided into two halves, each moving independently of the other like a hinge, the so-called motorcyclist's fracture. Hinge fractures are usually associated with brainstem injuries, particularly Ponto-medullar tears.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option A. Ring or Foramen fractures: It is fissured fracture of the skull which encircles the head in such a manner that the anterior third is separated at its junction with the middle and posterior third The fracture line runs at about 3 \u2013 5 cm. outside the foramen magnum at the back and sides of the skull and passes forwards through the middle ears and roof of the nose, so the head is separated from the spine. Option: B . Comminuted fractures: The bone is broken into multiple pieces in this skull fracture variety. e.g., RSA, fall from a height on a hard surface, and from blows by weapons with a large striking surface, kick by an animal, bullet injury, resembles a spider\u2019s web or mosaic Option: D. Subdural Haemorrhage: It is common in childhood or old age. Occurs in subdural space between the dura mater and arachnoid due to rupture of bridging or communicating veins, inferior cerebral veins, and cortical veins,e., the source of blood is venous or capillary, not arterial. Found in alcoholics, old persons, and children. Death may occur if the bleeding is> 50 ml.</p>\n<p></p>",
