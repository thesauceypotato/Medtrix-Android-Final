AChRs are part of the parasympathetic nerve supply of the body. As saliva is secreted secondary to parasympathetic stimulation, antagonism at AChRs results in dry mouth, as seen in this patient.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Other common anticholinergic effects include decreased sweating, tachycardia (unopposed sympathetic activity on the heart), blurring of vision for near objects (loss of accommodation reflex and mydriasis), urinary retention and constipation (loss of parasympathetic-mediated sphincter relaxation and peristalsis), and drowsiness.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Some antihistamines (e.g., cyproheptadine) have a serotonin receptor antagonistic action in addition to H1 receptor antagonism. However, serotonin plays no role in salivary secretion, so serotonin receptor antagonism is not responsible for the dry mouth this patient experiences after consuming the drug. Option: C. Agonism at \u03b21-adrenergic receptors in the salivary gland stimulates salivary protein secretion and to a lesser extent, also fluid secretion, and thus would not cause the dry mouth seen in this patient. Catecholamines can activate \u03b21-adrenergic receptors, but antihistamines do not affect Option: D. Drugs that antagonize H1 histamine receptors (antihistamines) are commonly used to treat pruritic rashes since histamine release in subcutaneous tissue triggers itching and localized vasodilation. Although this patient has a pruritic rash, histamine plays no role in salivary secretion, meaning histamine receptor antagonism is not responsible for this patient's dry mouth.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Pharmacological effects of histamine: Histamine promotes (intestinal and bronchiolar ) smooth muscle contraction, which is an H1 receptor-mediated effect. Histamine significantly increases gastric acid and gastric pepsin secretion, which is an H2 receptor-mediated effect Vasodilation of arteriole and precapillary sphincters, which is an H1 and H2 receptor-mediated effect</p>\n<p></p>",

In a heavy smoker , symptoms of Horner syndrome combined with ipsilateral shoulder and arm pain concern a Pancoast tumor. Compression of the stellate ganglion by a Pancoast tumor can lead to Horner syndrome via injury of preganglionic sympathetic fibers. Superior sulcus tumors can infiltrate neighboring structures and cause additional symptoms, known as Pancoast syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>This patient's shoulder and arm pain are likely symptoms of Pancoast syndrome, which also includes atrophy of the arm and hand muscles and possibly superior vena cava syndrome and hoarseness due to compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A . Cavernous sinus thrombosis can result in Horner syndrome due to compression of postganglionic sympathetic neurons. However, cavernous sinus thrombosis has additional symptoms that are absent in this case, such as headache, photophobia, proptosis, and other cranial nerve palsies (commonly CN VI). In addition, cavernous sinus thrombosis is most commonly caused by ascending infection from the face or sinuses, signs of which are absent This patient's arm and shoulder pain would likewise not be explained by cavernous sinus thrombosis Option: C . Infiltration of the cervical plexus, typically by neck soft tissue tumors or lymph node metastases, manifests with pain in the neck and submandibular area, as well as sensory loss in the C2, C3, and C4 dermatomes, symptoms which this patient does not have. It would not be expected to cause Horner syndrome or shoulder and arm pain. Option: D . Aneurysm of the posterior cerebral artery could compress CN III, which carries parasympathetic fibers to the pupillary sphincter and ciliary muscle, and motor fibers to the levator palpebrae superioris and all extraocular muscles except for the superior oblique muscle and the lateral rectus muscle. Such an aneurysm would result in ptosis, which this patient has, diplopia, a fixed and dilated pupil, and a down-and-out gaze , which are not present here. Rather than mydriasis, this patient has miosis. Furthermore, if such an aneurysm were symptomatic, it would manifest with a headache rather than the shoulder and arm pain seen here.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The most common cause of Pancoast syndrome is NSCLC , for which this patient is at risk because of his smoking history.</p>\n<p></p>",
