A form of QRS will be normal because electrical excitation of the ventricles occurs over essentially the normal pathway (i.e., AV node to bundle branches to Purkinje system to myocardium).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The T-wave will be normal as well. With a complete heart block, the P wave and QRS complex are independent of each other. Some PR intervals could be shortened by chance, others will be very long, that is there is a predictable PR interval. There will not be a consistent ratio of P waves to QRS complex, because the two are disassociated, but the average ratio would be 80/40.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes (for every P wave, a QRS complex is conducted). Option B . Inverted T waves are associated with myocardial ischemia. Option C. The presence of a short PR interval, frequently with a delta wave, defines the preexcitation syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Sick sinus syndrome (bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome; sinus node dysfunction) is a collection of heart rhythm disorders that include sinus bradycardia (slow heart rates from the natural pacemaker of the heart), tachycardias (fast heart rates), and bradycardia-tachycardia (alternating slow and fast heart rhythms). Sick sinus syndrome is relatively uncommon and is usually found in people older than 50. In patients with AV nodal block, the remaining nodal tissue becomes the pacemaker and the rate of the idioventricular rhythm is approximately 45 beats/min. In patients with infranodal block due to disease in the bundle of His, the ventricular pacemaker is located more peripherally in the conduction system and the ventricular rate is lower; it averages 35 beats/min, but in individual cases, it can be as low as 15 beats/min. In such individuals, there may also be periods of asystole lasting a minute or more. The resultant cerebral ischemia causes dizziness and fainting (Stokes\u2013Adams syndrome). Causes of third-degree heart block include septal myocardial infarction and damage to the bundle of His during surgical correction of congenital interventricular septal defects. When conduction between the atria and ventricles is slowed but not completely interrupted, incomplete heart block is present. In the form called first-degree heart block, all the atrial impulses reach the ventricles but the PR interval is abnormally long. In the form called second-degree heart block, not all atrial impulses are conducted to the ventricles. For example, a ventricular beat may follow every second or every third atrial beat (2:1 block, 3:1 block, etc). In another form of incomplete heart block, there are repeated sequences of beats in which the PR interval lengthens progressively until a ventricular beat is dropped (Wenckebach phenomenon). The PR interval of the cardiac cycle that follows each dropped beat is usually normal or only slightly prolonged.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The PR interval of the ECG is increased. The diagnosis of a first-degree heart block is made when the PR interval of the ECG is increased. The PR interval represents the time it takes for the cardiac action potential to propagate from the SA node to the ventricular muscle . A delay in this interval, normally produced by a slowing in the conduction velocity through the AV node, is called a first-degree heart block. A second-degree heart block occurs when the action potential does not always propagate through the SA node. This produces an uneven heartbeat. A third-degree block occurs when the action potential never reaches the ventricle. Under these conditions, pacemakers within the ventricle produce ventricular contraction but the rate is very slow. Inversion of the T wave and elevation of the ECG are indicators of membrane potential defects within the ventricular muscle.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>First-degree heart block: When conduction between the atria and ventricles is slowed but not completely interrupted, incomplete heart block is present. In the form called first-degree heart block, all the atrial impulses reach the ventricles but the PR interval is abnormally long. In second-degree heart block: not all atrial impulses are conducted to the ventricles. For example, a ventricular beat may follow every second or every third atrial beat (2:1 block, 3:1 block, etc). In another form of incomplete heart block, there are repeated sequences of beats in which the PR interval lengthens progressively until a ventricular beat is dropped (Wenckebach phenomenon). The PR interval of the cardiac cycle that follows each dropped beat is usually normal or only slightly prolonged. Sometimes one branch of the bundle of His is interrupted, causing a right or left bundle branch block. In a bundle branch block, excitation passes normally down the bundle on the intact side and then sweeps back through the muscle to activate the ventricle on the blocked side. The ventricular rate is therefore normal, but the QRS complexes are prolonged and deformed. Block can also occur in the anterior or posterior fascicle of the left bundle branch, producing the condition called hemiblock or a fascicular block. The left anterior hemiblock produces abnormal left axis deviation in the ECG, whereas the left posterior hemiblock produces abnormal right axis deviation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- If  the P wave of the ECG is never followed by a QRS complex, this is likely indicative of a complete heart block, which is a more severe conduction abnormality. Similarly, if the P wave of the ECG is sometimes followed by a QRS complex, this may be indicative of a second-degree heart block, in which some P waves are conducted to the ventricles and others are not. The T wave of the ECG being inverted may be indicative of various cardiac conditions, but is not related to the diagnosis of heart block.</p>\n<p></p>",
