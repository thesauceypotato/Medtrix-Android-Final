This type of variation of a statistic from one sample to another is called sampling error. It occurs because data were gathered from a sample rather than from the entire population. Presuming that the sampling procedure favoured all the individuals\u2019 in the population equally to come to the sample, the factors that influence the sampling error are: \u2013  Size of the sample and \u2013  Natural variability of the individual readings. As the size of the sample increases, sampling error will decrease. Standard Error (SE): SE is a measure of variability of sample statistic from the population parameter. Standard Error (SE) of the Mean: If \u201cn\u201d number of samples of the same size are taken from the same population randomly and repeatedly, each sample will have its own sample mean which would vary to an extent from each other and from the population mean. The sample means would be normally distributed around the population mean (\u00b5) and the mean of the sample means practically is the same as the population mean (\u00b5). Thus standard deviation of the sample means is a measure of the \u201cSampling Error\u201d or \u201cmeasure of chance variation\u201d SE of mean is the Standard deviation of the sample means. Standard Error of the mean is calculated by the formula, \u2013  SE of mean = Standard deviation (SD)/\u221aSample size \u2013  SE of mean = SD/\u221an From the formula, it could be inferred that greater the standard deviation, greater will be the standard error. Similarly, smaller the sample size greater will be the standard error. SE can be minimized by reducing SD and by taking a large sample.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options B, C and D are false.</p>\n<p></p>",
