A hypomanic episode lasts at least 4 days and is similar to a manic episode except that it is not sufficiently severe to cause impairment in social or occupational functioning, and no psychotic features are present. Bipolar I disorder is defined as having a clinical course of one or more manic episodes and, sometimes, major depressive disorder . A mixed episode is at least 1 week in which both a manic episode and a major depressive episode occur almost daily. Dysthymic disorder is characterized by at least 2 years of depressed mood t hat is not sufficiently severe to the diagnosis of a major depressive episode. Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by at least 2 years of frequently occurring hypomanic symptoms that cannot t the diagnosis of a manic episode and of depressive symptoms that cannot fit the diagnosis of a major depressive episode.</p>\n<p></p>",

The treatment of acute mania, or hypomania, usually is the easiest phase of bipolar disorders to treat. Agents can be used alone or in combination to bring the patient down from a high. Patients with severe mania are best treated in the hospital where aggressive dosing is possible and an adequate response can be achieved within days or weeks. Treatment adherence , however, is often a problem because patients with mania frequently lack insight into their illness and refuse to take medication. Because impaired judgment, impulsivity, and aggressiveness combine to put the patient or others at risk, many patients in the manic phase are medicated to protect themselves and others from harm.</p>\n<p></p>",
