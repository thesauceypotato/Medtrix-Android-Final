The skeletal sites most commonly involved are the pelvis, vertebral bodies, skull, femur and tibia. The most common presenting feature is pain, which may result from increased bony vascularity, expanding lytic lesions, fractures, and bowing. Bowing of the femur or tibia causes gait abnormality and mechanical stresses with secondary osteoarthritis of hip or knee joints. Long bone bowing also causes extremity pain by stretching the muscle attached to the bone softened extremity pain by stretching muscle attached to the bone softened by the pagetic process. Back pain results from enlarged pagetic vertebrae, vertebral compression fractures, spinal stenosis, degenerative changes of the joints and altered body mechanics with kyphosis and forward tilt of the upper back. Spinal cord compression may result from bone enlargement or vascular steal syndrome. Skull involvement may cause headaches, symmetric or asymmetric enlargement of the parietal or frontal bones and increased head size. Compression of the nerve due to narrow cranial nerve foramen causes neurological complications like hearing loss from cochlear nerve damage from temporal bone involvement, cranial palsies and softening of the base of the skull(platybasia) with a risk of brainstem compression.
