It is one of the predominant causes of recurrent UTI and reflux nephropathy in children. There are strong reports of its familial tendency and AD mode of inheritance. VUR is graded based on the degree of dilatation and renal collecting system morphology;</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Grade I reflux does not reach the renal pelvis; Grade II reflux reaches the renal pelvis with no dilatation of the collecting system; Grade III reflux involves mild to moderate dilatation of the ureter and moderate dilatation of the collecting system with normal or minimally deformed fornices; Grade IV reflux involves moderate dilatation of the ureter and moderate dilatation of the collecting system with blunt fornices; Grade V reflux involves gross dilatation of the ureter, marked dilatation of the collecting system; and intraparenchymal reflux. Treatment of VUR aims to preserve kidney function by minimizing the risk of pyelonephritis; management options either involve keeping children on antimicrobial prophylaxis and watchful expectancy for VUR to resolve spontaneously or immediate surgery. Faster resolution of VUR can be expected in children < 1 year at presentation and those with a lower grade of reflux (grade I\u2013III).</p>\n<p></p>",

There are strong reports of its familial tendency and AD mode of inheritance. VUR is graded based on the degree of dilatation and renal collecting system morphology; Grade I reflux does not reach the renal pelvis; Grade II reflux reaches the renal pelvis with no dilatation of the collecting system; Grade III reflux involves mild to moderate dilatation of the ureter and moderate dilatation of the collecting system with normal or minimally deformed fornices; Grade IV reflux involves moderate dilatation of the ureter and moderate dilatation of the collecting system with blunt fornices; Grade V reflux involves gross dilatation of the ureter, marked dilatation of the collecting system; and intraparenchymal reflux. Treatment of VUR aims to preserve kidney function by minimizing the risk of pyelonephritis; management options either involve keeping children on antimicrobial prophylaxis and watchful expectancy for VUR to resolve spontaneously or immediate surgery. Faster resolution of VUR can be expected in children < 1 year at presentation and those with a lower grade of reflux (grade I\u2013III).</p>\n<p></p>",
