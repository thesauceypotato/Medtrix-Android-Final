Retroperitoneal neoplasms (especially lymphomas or sarcomas ) enter the spinal canal laterally through the intervertebral foramina and produce radicular pain with signs of weakness that correspond to the level of involved nerve roots. Pain Initial symptom of spinal metastasis Aching and localized Sharp and radiating in quality worsens with movement, coughing, or sneezing Awakens patients at night A recent onset of persistent back pain , particularly if in the thoracic spine (which is uncommonly involved by spondylosis ), should prompt consideration of vertebral metastasis. Investigations- MRI Anatomic resolution of the extent of spinal tumors distinguish between malignant lesions and another masses-epidural abscess , tuberculoma, lipoma, or epidural hemorrhage Infections of the spinal column (osteomyelitis and related disorders) are distinctive in that, unlike tumors, they often cross the disk space to involve the adjacent vertebral body. Plain radiographs of the spine and radionuclide bone scans limited role in diagnosis do not identify 15\u201320% of metastatic vertebral lesions fail to detect paravertebral masses that reach the epidural space through the intervertebral foramina. Biopsy unnecessary in patients with known primary cancer indicated if a history of underlying cancer is lacking. If spinal cord compression is suspected Immediate imaging Up to 40% of patients who present with cord compression at one level are found to have asymptomatic epidural metastases elsewhere ; thus, imaging of the entire length of the spine is important to define the extent of disease. If there are radicular symptoms but no evidence of myelopathy , it may be safe to defer imaging for 24\u201348 h. TREATMENT- multiple considerations Radiosensitivity of the primary tumor extent of compression prior therapy to the site stability of the spine. Treatment includes Glucocorticoids To reduce cord edema Glucocorticoids (typically dexamethasone, 10 mg intravenously ) can be administered before an imaging study if there is clinical suspicion of cord compression and continued at a lower dose (4 mg every 6 h orally) until definitive treatment with radiotherapy and/or surgical decompression is completed. Surgery/ local radiotherapy (initiated as early as possible) to the symptomatic lesion Stereotactic body radiotherapy high doses of focused radiation Preferred for radioresistant tumor types for patients requiring re-irradiation. Surgical treatment Decompression by Laminectomy A spinal fixation procedure Indications- signs of cord compression worsen despite radiotherapy the maximum-tolerated dose of radiotherapy has been delivered previously to the site a vertebral compression fracture spinal instability contributes to cord compression high-grade spinal cord compression from a radioresistant tumor. Outcome of treatment- A good response to therapy in Ambulatory patients prevents new weakness some recovery of motor function occurs in up to one-third of patients Motor deficits (paraplegia or quadriplegia) for >12 h :do not usually improve beyond 48:prognosis for substantial motor recovery is poor.

Once weakness and other signs of myelopathy appear , progression may be rapid and irreversible.

Risk factors- Impaired immune status (HIV, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, alcoholism, malignancy) Intravenous drug abuse Infections of the skin or other tissues-(causes 2/3rd of the epidural abscess) hematogenous spread of bacteria from the skin (furunculosis), soft tissue (pharyngeal or dental abscesses; sinusitis), or deep viscera (bacterial endocarditis). direct extension of a local infection to the subdural space ; vertebral osteomyelitis, decubitus ulcers, lumbar puncture, epidural anesthesia spinal surgery.
