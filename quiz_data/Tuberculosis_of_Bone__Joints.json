Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I), also known as Von Gierke disease, is an inherited disorder caused by deficiencies of specific enzymes in the glycogen metabolism pathway. It comprises of 2 subtypes, GSD Ia and GSD Ib. In GSD Ia, there is a deficiency of enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, leading to hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. Patients with GSD 1b have normal G6Pase enzyme activity but have a deficiency of the transporter enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate translocase (G6PT), manifesting as hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis typically around 3 to 4 months of age. In suspected patients, genetic testing is the investigation of choice to confirm the diagnosis. Dietary treatment prevents hypoglycemia and improves the life expectancy of patients.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. von Gierke\u2019s disease</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Gordon\u2019s disease . Gordon Syndrome is a rare, inherited disorder that affects movement in the joints of the upper and lower limbs, also known as distal arthrogryposis. Patients can be born with several fingers fixed in a flexed position (camptodactyly), clubfoot, and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). Their joints are often very stiff or unable to move. Intelligence is usually normal. Gordon syndrome is caused by genetic mutations in the PIEZO2 gene and can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Gordon syndrome is diagnosed by clinical examination and genetic testing. Treatment is directed at the symptoms and includes surgery and physical therapy to loosen the joints.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
