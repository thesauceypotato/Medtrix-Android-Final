      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>SMAD 4 SMAD4 is not an oncogene but a tumour suppressor gene that is commonly inactivated in pancreatic cancer.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. KRAS: It is an oncogene that is frequently mutated in pancreatic cancer. It is a GTPase that plays a key role in signal transduction pathways involved in cell growth and proliferation. Mutations in the KRAS gene are found in up to 90% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and are believed to be an early event in the development of the disease. Option: B. AKT2: It is another oncogene that is commonly mutated in pancreatic cancer. It is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates several downstream signalling pathways involved in cell survival and proliferation. Amplification or overexpression of the AKT2 gene has been observed in approximately 30% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and is associated with a more aggressive tumour phenotype. Option: C. MYB: It is an oncogene that is commonly mutated in pancreatic cancer. It is a proto-oncogene that is involved in regulating cell growth and differentiation in several different tissues. Myb promotes pancreatic cancer cell growth, clonogenicity, migration and invasion.</p>\n<p></p>",
