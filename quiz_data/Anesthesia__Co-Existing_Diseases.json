The depolarizing agents (succinylcholine) act through the same receptors. Therefore, succinylcholine will have less receptors to act thereby it is required in higher doses. Non-depolarizers are competitive antagonists at acetylcholine receptors. Due to less receptors, the sensitivity of non-depolarizers is increased, so potent and long-acting agents like d-tubocurarine, gallamine, and Pancuronium can produce very dense and prolonged blocks. Short-acting non-depolarizers like atracurium, cis-atracurium, and mivacurium have no risk of accumulation, therefore, will be preferred in myasthenia patients.</p>\n<p></p>",
