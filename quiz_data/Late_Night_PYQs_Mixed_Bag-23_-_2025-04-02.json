      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. C. Paratonsillar vein</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 In the case described, the patient likely underwent surgery for a peritonsillar abscess (aka Quinsy), a complication arising from tonsillitis. This condition can lead to significant swelling in the throat and difficulty swallowing. Post-operative bleeding in such cases, especially the continuous type noted as soaking through gauze, is most commonly associated with venous sources rather than arterial.</li><li>\u2022 The given image is a cadaveric specimen with an arrow pointing to the tonsillar fossa. The paratonsillar / external palatine vein is the typical site of venous origin for post-tonsillectomy bleeding.</li><li>\u2022 The paratonsillar vein, which is closely associated with the tonsillar bed and provides significant venous drainage for the tonsil, is the likely source of this bleeding. Venous bleeding tends to be continuous and can be persistent if the vein is not adequately secured during surgery.</li><li>\u2022 Torrential hemorrhage can be due to injury to an aberrantly large or aberrantly placed tonsillar arterial branch of the facial artery.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Tonsillar branch of the facial artery : The tonsils receive blood supply primarily from the tonsillar branch of the facial artery. Injury to this artery during tonsillar surgery can cause bleeding, but the bleeding is usually brisk and bright red, and the artery would likely be cauterized or ligated during surgery to prevent such bleeding.</li><li>\u2022 Option A.</li><li>\u2022 Tonsillar branch of the facial artery</li><li>\u2022 Option B . Ascending pharyngeal artery : It's a branch of the external carotid artery and supplies the pharynx, soft palate, and the tympanic cavity. While this artery does provide blood supply to the pharyngeal region, it's not as intimately associated with the tonsillar region as the tonsillar branch of the facial artery.</li><li>\u2022 Option B</li><li>\u2022 Ascending pharyngeal artery</li><li>\u2022 Option D . Retromandibular vein : The retromandibular vein is formed by the union of the superficial temporal vein and the maxillary vein in the parotid gland. It's located further away from the tonsillar region, and it's unlikely to be injured during procedures involving the tonsils.</li><li>\u2022 Option D</li><li>\u2022 Retromandibular vein</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Blood supply of the tonsils:</li><li>\u27a4 Blood supply of the tonsils:</li><li>\u27a4 Arterial supply:</li><li>\u27a4 Arterial supply:</li><li>\u27a4 The tonsillar branch of the facial artery is the main supply.
