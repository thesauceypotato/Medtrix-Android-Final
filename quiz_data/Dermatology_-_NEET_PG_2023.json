Cause: A fungal infection caused by H. capsulatum . Associated with bird and bat droppings (Caves) Characteristics: pulmonary involvement and cutaneous involvement. Pulmonary involvement: Cough, chest pain, dyspnea Cutaneous involvement : It is rare and is characterized by a nodule or indurated ulcer and there is often local lymphadenopathy.

Hypersensitivity due to TB: It can occur in patients who have been previously exposed to TB and have developed a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. It can present with symptoms such as fever, cough, and chest pain, but typically not with skin nodules. Option B . Cryptococcus: It is a fungal infection that can affect immunocompromised individuals, including HIV-positive patients. However, it typically presents with symptoms such as headache, fever, and meningitis, rather than lung and skin nodules. Option C . Disseminated Molluscum contagiosum: It is a viral infection caused that typically presents with multiple, small, raised, and painless nodules on the skin. It is not usually associated with lung involvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Systemic mycoses Disease Pathological feature Conidia Signs/ Symptoms Endemic location Special characteristics Histoplasmosis (Darling\u2019s disease) Macrophage with intracellular yeast cell ( contracted cytoplasm) Tuberculate conidia Cough, chest pain, dyspnea (pneumonia ), nodule or induration ulcer, palatal ulcer, splenomegaly, pancytopenia, Erythema nodosum Mississippi/ Ohio Associated with birds and bat droppings   (Cave) Blastomycosis (Gilchrist\u2019s disease) Broad-based budding yeast Pear-shaped conidia along hyphae Inflammatory lung disease which disseminates to bones, skin and prostate North America mimics SCC Coccidioidomycosis Sperules filled with endospores Rectangular conidia Arthralgia, Meningitis, Disseminates to bones and skin, California Associated with dust exposure         (Archeological) Para-coccidiamycosis Budding yeast give captain wheel/ Mickey Mouse appearance Pear-shaped conidia Inflammatory lung disease disseminate to bones, skin and prostate South America Talaromycosis ( Penicillium marneffei) Broom brush appearance Small painless bumps in the skin, fever Southeast Asia The red powdery surface on the culture</p>\n<p></p>",

The patient is likely to suffer from malignant melanoma as an ocular complication. A melanocytic nevus is a type of mole that develops from melanocytes, which are cells that produce the pigment melanin. When the nevus is large and involves a significant area of the skin, it is called a giant melanocytic nevus. This condition is associated with an increased risk of developing malignant melanoma , which is a type of cancer that arises from melanocytes. Melanoma can occur in the eye and is called uveal melanoma. It develops from cells in the uvea, which is the layer of tissue that lines the inside of the eye. Patients with giant melanocytic nevus have an increased risk of developing uveal melanoma, especially if the nevus involves the iris or ciliary body.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A and B: Cataracts and glaucoma are not specifically associated with giant melanocytic nevus.
