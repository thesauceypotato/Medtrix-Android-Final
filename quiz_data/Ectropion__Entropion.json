It is usually attributed to a spasm of the orbicularis muscle brought on by ocular irritation. The entropion is corrected by two factors The tightening of the orbicularis muscle , which has accumulated at the upper lid margin. The buried suture by supporting the lower half of the tarsus does not allow it to turn outwards and thus keeps it against the globe, restoring to some extent the ori\u00acginal snug relationship.

Marginal entropion has increasingly been recognized as a very common cause of eyelash misdirection, secondary to subtle cicatricial posterior lamellar shortening that rotates a segment of the lid margin towards the eye. The mucocutaneous junction migrates anteriorly and the posterior lid margin becomes rounded rather than physiologically square. Typically, numerous aligned lashes are involved. Option: C. Congenital distichiasis is a rare condition that occurs when a primary epithelial germ cell destined to differentiate into a meibomian gland develops instead of into a complete pilosebaceous unit. The condition is frequently inherited in an AD manner. The majority of patients also manifest primary lymphoedema of the legs (lymphoedema-distichiasis syndrome) . A partial or complete second row of lashes is seen to emerge at or slightly behind the meibomian gland orifices. The aberrant lashes tend to be thinner and shorter than normal cilia and are often directed posteriorly. Option: D. Acquired distichiasis is caused by metaplasia of the meibomian glands into hair follicles such that a variable number of lashes grow from meibomian gland openings.
