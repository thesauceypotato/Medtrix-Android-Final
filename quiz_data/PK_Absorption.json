      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Bioavailability It is a measure of the fraction of administered dose of a drug that reaches the systemic circulation in an unchanged form for example, if we give 500mg of the drug paracetamol by oral route then if 350mg is available for systemic action, 350mg of the drug is bioavailable</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Bioavailability refers to the rate and extent of absorption of a drug from a dosage form administered by any route, as determined by its concentration-time curve in blood or by its excretion in urine. It is a measure of the fraction (F ) of the administered dose of a drug that reaches systemic circulation in the unchanged form. Bioavailability of drug injected i.v. is 100%, but is frequently lower after oral ingestion because\u2014 (a) the drug may be incompletely absorbed. (b) the absorbed drug may under first-pass pass metabolism in the intestinal wall/liver or be excreted in bile Incomplete bioavailability after s.c. or i.m. injection is less common but may occur due to the local binding of the drug</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Elimination These organs or structures use specific routes to expel a drug from the body, these are termed elimination pathways: Urine Tears Perspiration Saliva Respiration Milk Faeces Bile . Option: C. Clearance Drug clearance can be defined as the plasma volume in the vascular compartment that is cleared of drugs per unit of time. Total clearance gives an indication of drug elimination from the central compartment without reference to the mechanism of this process. For drugs that are eliminated by first-order kinetics, clearance is constant. Option: D. Metabolism is the set of life-sustaining chemical reactions in organisms. The three main functions of metabolism are the conversion of the energy in food to the energy available to run cellular processes; the conversion of food to building blocks for proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and some carbohydrates.</p>\n<p></p>",

It is useful for the prevention of tonic-clonic seizures (also known as grand mal seizures) and focal seizures, but not absence seizures.

Oral administration is a route of administration where a substance is taken through the mouth. Per os abbreviated to P.O. is sometimes used as a direction for medication to be taken orally. Option: C. Rectal administration uses the rectum as a route of administration for medication and other fluids, which are absorbed by the rectum's blood vessels and flow into the body's circulatory system, which distributes the drug to the body's organs and bodily systems Option: D. Intradermal injection , often abbreviated ID, is a shallow or superficial injection of a substance into the dermis, which is located between the epidermis and the hypodermis.
