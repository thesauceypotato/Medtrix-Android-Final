About a month ago, he noticed a sore on his penis but did not seek medical attention because the ulcer was not painful and disappeared within a week. Several days ago, he began to experience painful swelling in his inguinal region, with inflammation of the overlying skin and the eventual formation of several draining ulcers. He also has a mild fever and malaise that began around the same time as his groin symptoms. His other medical problems include well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Cell scrapings from his lesions show cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",

LGV is characterized initially by a painless, small, shallow genital ulcer containing infected cells. The painless nature helps distinguish LGV from other diseases. The appearance of the ulcer is followed weeks later by swollen, painful, c oalescing inguinal nodes (\"buboes\"- Groove\u2019s sign- due to the thickening of the inguinal ligament, separating the lymph nodes) that can develop stellate abscesses and rupture . If left untreated, LGV can cause fibrosis, lymphatic obstruction, and anogenital strictures and fistulas. Histologically, LGV lesions contain areas of mixed granulomatous and neutrophilic inflammation with intracytoplasmic chlamydial Inclusion bodies in epithelial and inflammatory cells. Doxycycline is recommended.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B: Haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid, an ulcerative, sexually transmitted infection characterized by painful (rather than painless) red papules on the genitals that eventually erode to become tender ulcers (you \"do cry\" with H ducreyi). Regional lymph nodes may swell and become chronic ulcers. Option C: Herpes simplex virus type 2 is the most common cause of genital herpes, characterized by vesicles that develop into shallow, painful ulcers. These lesions often heal within 10 days. Histologically, multinucleated giant cells and large pinkish-purple intranuclear (not intracytoplasmic) inclusions, t ermed Cowdry type A bodies, are present. Option D: Klebsiella granulomatous causes granuloma inguinale (donovanosis) , which also initially manifests as a painless genital papule that eventually ulcerates; however, lymphadenopathy is uncommon. Intracytoplasmic Donovan bodies (bipolar stained klebsiella granulomatis) are diagnostic. I f donovanosis is untreated, scarring and strictures can lead to severe lymphatic obstruction and lymphedema (elephantiasis).</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>D-alanine-D-alanine This patient likely has a chance due to primary syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Spirochetes are universally sensitive to penicillin because they are all gram-negative organisms with a peptidoglycan cell wall. Penicillins work by covalently binding to and inhibiting transpeptidase. This enzyme catalyzes the final cross-linking step in peptidoglycan cell wall formation : the joining of the amino acid in the third position of a peptidoglycan molecule to the terminal D-alanine-D-alanine of another peptidoglycan molecule. The structural similarity of penicillins to D-alanine-D-alanine likely facilitates their binding to transpeptidase. When transpeptidase is inhibited, cell wall synthesis ceases and cell wall degradation by bacterial autolysins proceeds unchecked. The weakened cell wall integrity causes osmotic lysis of the bacterium. Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, directly binds to the D-alanine-D-alanine residues, preventing the incorporation of new subunits into the cell wall. Vancomycin acts at an earlier stage of cell wall formation than do the penicillins.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Options B and D: D-glutamic acid-D-glutamic acid and L-alanine-D-glutamine are not sequences targeted by transpeptidase. Penicillin is not a structural analog of either molecule. Option C: Sulfonamide antibiotics are antimetabolites that compete with para-aminobenzoic acid for incorporation into folic acid. Trimethoprim blocks another step in folic acid synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase.</p>\n<p></p>",
