Early breast cancer, in exceptional cases, makes it easier to perform breast conservation surgery (BCS). HER2/neu-positive tumors and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Premenopausal women (age <50 years). Patients with axillary node metastasis. For patients with HER2-positive breast cancer , trastuzumab and pertuzumab can be combined with chemotherapy in the preoperative setting to increase pathologic complete response rates. For inoperable stage IIIA and stage IIIB breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreases the burden of local-regional cancer. This may permit subsequent modified radical or radical mastectomy, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy.</p>\n<p></p>",
