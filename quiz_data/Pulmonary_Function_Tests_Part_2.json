      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>FEV1/FVC increases and compliance decreases People with restrictive lung disease cannot fully fill their lungs with air. Their lungs are restricted from fully expanding. Restrictive lung disease most often results from a condition causing stiffness in the lungs themselves. In other cases, stiffness of the chest wall, weak muscles, or damaged nerves may cause restriction in lung expansion. Some conditions causing restrictive lung disease are: Interstitial lung disease , such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Sarcoidosis , an autoimmune disease Obesity , including obesity hypoventilation syndrome Scoliosis Neuromuscular disease, such as muscular dystrophy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Basic Concept: During an obstruction in airways, there is a decrease in expiratory flow which becomes more pronounced when expiration is more forceful. Hallmark is a decrease in expiratory flow rates. FEV1 is markedly reduced and FVC is mildly reduced so the ratio of FEV1 / FVC is highly reduced.

Static Compliance Static compliance indicates compliance when the lungs are at rest Static compliance values reflect true lung compliance alone Static compliance reflects the elasticity of the lung and is not affected by airway resistance because there is no flow Reduced static compliance indicates rigid lung tissue Causes of reduced static compliance Interstitial fibrosis (Fibrosing alveolitis) Atelectasis ARDS iii. Pulmonary edema Pneumonia Reduced static compliance is usually also associated with decreased dynamic compliance due to associated airway resistance f. Increased static compliance indicates easily expandable lung, Example is Emphysema Dynamic compliance Reduced Dynamic compliance (without change in static compliance(without change in static compliance) indicates Ted's airway resistance Dynamic compliance is affected by both elasticity of the lung and airway resistance Dynamic compliance values reflect lung compliance along with airway resistance Dynamic compliance indicates compliance when airflow is occurring Obstruction Bronchospasm (Allergic Asthma) iThe collapse of small airways etc Reduced Dynamic compliance with reduced static compliance Most conditions where static compliance is reduced are also associated with reduced dynamic compliance due to the associated increase in airway resistance</p>\n<p></p>",

So lung volume increases for the same amount of transpulmonary pressure. Another point about inspiration in emphysema is that the lung attains a completely filled position, much earlier. This is because, loss of elasticity prevents full expansion of the lung, or airway restriction, during breathing.

Diseases that narrow the airway lumen at any transmural pressure (e.g., asthma or chronic bronchitis) or that cause excessive airway collapsibility (e.g., tracheomalacia) also reduce maximal expiratory flow. The Bernoulli effect applies during inspiration, but the more negative pleural pressures during inspiration lower the pressure outside of the airways, thereby increasing transmural pressure and promoting airway expansion.

Because flow is constant along the airway tree, the velocity of airflow (flow/summed cross-sectional area) is much greater in the central airways than in the peripheral airways. During exhalation, the gas leaving the alveoli must, therefore, gain velocity as it proceeds toward the mouth. The energy required for this \u201c convective\u201d acceleration is drawn from the component of gas energy manifested as its local pressure, which reduces intraluminal gas pressure, airway transmural pressure, airway size, and flow. This phenomenon is the Bernoulli effect . This is the reason for the flow limit, which is also responsible for the residual volume of the lungs.

The RV is important to a healthy person RV optimizes energy expenditure: After an airway collapses, unusually high pressure is required to reinflate it Blood flow to the lungs and other parts of the body is continuous, even though ventilation is episodic.

In normal subjects, the measurement is primarily determined by the contribution of the anatomical dead space, with a small addition from the alveolar dead space attributable to normal ventilation/perfusion heterogeneity. [directly taken from a summary of European respiratory journal] VP heterogenicity here is -ventilation is same, but perfusion wrt ventilation is almost half = VP heterogenicity-V/P/2) =2V/P= heterogenicity is doubled This means physiological dead space can be expected to get doubled. Here alveolar ventilation (tidal volume-physiological dead space) * RR Physiological dead space = anatomical dead space + alveolar (functional) dead space (volume entering alveoli of only left lungs) Dead space = 200+ (600-200)/2 =          400 Alveolar ventilation =          (600-400) 20 =          200 20 =          4000 ml = 4 L Alveolar ventilation < the minute ventilation because the last part of each inspiration remains in the conducting airways and does not reach the alveoli. The last part of each expiration remains in the conducting airways and is not expelled from the body. No gas exchange occurs in the conducting airways for anatomic reasons: The walls of the conducting airways are too thick for much diffusion to take place; mixed venous blood does not come into contact with the air: the anatomic dead space. Thus, with each 600-mt, inspiration, only the initial 400 mL of fresh air entering the body reaches the alveoli. With each 600-mL expiration, only the final 400 mL of air exiting the body comes from the alveoli. One 200-mL bolus of fresh air shuttles back and forth between the atmosphere and conducting airways. Another 200-ml bolus of stale air shuttles back and forth between the conducting airways and alveoli.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. 2 L is the wrong answer as it is not the value obtained on applying the formula Option: C. 16 L is the wrong answer as it is not the value obtained on applying the formula Option: D. 8 L is the wrong answer as it is not the value obtained on applying the formula</p>\n<p></p>",
