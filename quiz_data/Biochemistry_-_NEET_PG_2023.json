      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Vit C The villagers are suffering from Osteolathyrism which is a type of lathyrism that specifically affects bone health. It is caused by the consumption of the legume Lathyrus sativus, which contains a neurotoxin called beta-N-oxalyl-L-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid (BOAA). BOAA interferes with the cross-linking of collagen, a key structural protein in bone, leading to weakened bones and an increased risk of fractures. Osteolathyrism is most commonly seen in populations where grass pea is a staple food and is consumed in large amounts. The condition is characterized by a gradual onset of bone pain, muscle weakness, and difficulty walking. X-rays may show evidence of osteoporosis, bone deformities, and fractures. There is no known cure for osteolathyrism, and treatment is primarily focused on managing the symptoms and preventing further bone loss. Prevention of osteolathyrism involves limiting the consumption of grass pea and promoting a varied diet that includes other sources of protein and nutrients essential for bone health. Vitamin C acts as a cofactor for collagen hydroxylation which promotes crosslinking of collagen fibrils. Hence It can be used a prophylactic measure to manage the disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option A. Vitamin A deficiency is most commonly seen populations where diets are low in animal products and vegetables. Option B. Vitamin D deficiency is caused in people with poor exposure to sunlight and in those who have a poor diet or malabsorption disorders. Option D. Vitamin K deficiency may be caused by prolonged antibiotic treatment which cause loss of intestinal microflora responsible for vitamin K synthesis in humans and in newborns due to a variety of reasons. Symptoms of vitamin K deficiency can include easy bruising, bleeding gums, and heavy menstrual bleeding.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Lecithin Lecithin aka Dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline Lung surfactants are secreted by Type II pneumocytes. Surfactant reduces surface tension of the aqueous layer of lung and prevents collapse of lung alveoli. Constituents of surfactants: Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or dipalmitoyl lecithin (DPL), phosphatidyl glycerol, cholesterol and surfactant proteins A, B and C. During fetal life, lung synthesizes sphingomyelin before 28th week of GA & when fetus matures, more lecithin is produced. The lecithin-sphingomyelin (LS) ratio of amniotic fluid is an index of fetal maturity. If the ratio is 2, it indicates full lung maturity. Lecithin absence from the lungs of premature infants causes respiratory distress syndrome. Premature infants have a higher incidence of RDS because the immature lungs do not synthesize enough DPL.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option A. Phosphatidyl ethanolamine or Cephalin is found in bio membranes and possess amphipathic properties. Option D. Cardiolipin or Di phosphatidylglycerol is a major lipid of mitochondrial membrane and extracted from myocardium. Decreased cardiolipin level results in mitochondrial dysfunction, heart failure, hypothyroidism, and myopathies.</p>\n<p></p>",
