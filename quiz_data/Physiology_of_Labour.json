Test papers are impregnated with the dye, and the colour of the reaction between these paper strips and vaginal fluids is interpreted by comparison with a standard colour chart. A pH above 6.5 is consistent with ruptured membranes. False-positive test results may occur with coexistent blood, semen, or bacterial vaginosis False-negative tests may result with scant fluid.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Nitrazine test for Diagnosis of Premature rupture of Membranes: Principle: The vaginal pH is normally 4.5 to 5.5, where as amniotic fluid usually has a pH of 7.0 to 7.5. Result: Nitrazine paper will turn deep blue if amniotic fluid is present in vagina i.e., membranes have ruptured as pH will become alkaline. The membranes probably are intact if the color of the paper remains yellow or changes to olive-yellow (pH 5.0 to 5.5). Test: Nitrazine paper is smeared with vaginal secretions. False result: Antiseptic solution, urine, blood, and vaginal infections alterthe vaginal pH and cause false- positive results</p>\n<p></p>",
