      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder and the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient areas. The condition is characterized by symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, constipation, and increased sensitivity to cold, which are all signs of hypothyroidism. The physical exam typically reveals an enlarged thyroid gland, which may feel firm but is usually non-tender. The ultrasound findings of a diffusely enlarged thyroid with heterogeneous texture further support the diagnosis. Histologically, Hashimoto thyroiditis shows lymphocytic infiltration, germinal center formation, and Hurthle cell changes.</li><li>\u2022 Pathophysiology : In Hashimoto thyroiditis, the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, leading to chronic inflammation and gradual thyroid destruction. This autoimmune process is mediated by autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin, resulting in a gradual decline in thyroid hormone production.</li><li>\u2022 Pathophysiology</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Subacute thyroiditis: This option is incorrect because subacute thyroiditis, often following a viral illness, typically presents with a painful, tender thyroid gland. Patients may initially experience hyperthyroidism due to thyroid inflammation and release of stored hormones, followed by a period of hypothyroidism. Histology would show granulomatous inflammation, not the lymphocytic infiltration seen in Hashimoto thyroiditis.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Subacute thyroiditis:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Riedel thyroiditis: This option is incorrect because Riedel thyroiditis is a rare condition characterized by fibrous replacement of thyroid tissue, leading to a hard, fixed thyroid mass. Symptoms are typically more mechanical, such as compression of surrounding structures, and histology shows dense fibrosis without the characteristic lymphocytic infiltration seen in Hashimoto thyroiditis.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Riedel thyroiditis:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Toxic multinodular goiter: This option is incorrect as toxic multinodular goiter usually presents with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including weight loss, palpitations, and heat intolerance. Ultrasound would show a nodular thyroid, and histology would demonstrate nodules of varying sizes rather than diffuse lymphocytic infiltration.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Toxic multinodular goiter:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder and the leading cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Seminomas are the most common type of testicular germ cell tumors in adult men, often presenting as painless, firm testicular masses. Morphologically, seminomas are well-circumscribed, pale, gray-white, and homogeneous masses with a fleshy and lobulated cut surface, typically without hemorrhage or necrosis. Histologically, they consist of sheets of large, uniform cells with clear cytoplasm and distinct cell borders. The nuclei are centrally located, large, and round with prominent nucleoli. Minimal mitotic activity and a lack of significant inflammatory infiltrate, such as lymphocytes or syncytiotrophoblast cells, are typical features, which help distinguish seminomas from more aggressive germ cell tumors.</li><li>\u2022 Pathophysiology : Seminomas arise from germ cells and exhibit relatively indolent growth compared to other testicular tumors. Their uniform histological appearance and response to radiation and chemotherapy contribute to an excellent prognosis when detected early.</li><li>\u2022 Pathophysiology</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Embryonal carcinoma: This option is incorrect because embryonal carcinoma is a more aggressive, poorly differentiated germ cell tumor often associated with elevated tumor markers such as AFP or \u03b2-hCG. Histologically, it displays a more disorganized architecture with high mitotic activity, pleomorphic cells, and areas of hemorrhage and necrosis, contrasting with the orderly appearance of seminomas.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Embryonal carcinoma:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Spermatocytic tumor: This option is incorrect as spermatocytic tumors are rare testicular tumors typically occurring in older men. They have a different histological appearance characterized by a mix of small, medium, and large cells without the clear cytoplasm seen in seminomas. They are generally slow-growing and do not show the same aggressive behavior as seminomas.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Spermatocytic tumor:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Testicular lymphoma: This option is incorrect because testicular lymphoma is the most common testicular tumor in older men but is very rare in younger adults. It usually presents with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma histology, showing sheets of lymphoid cells rather than the large, clear cells characteristic of seminomas.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Key characteristics include a painless lateral neck mass in a pediatric patient, the non-tender nature of the mass, and the presence of caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and freckling in axillary and inguinal regions. Neurofibromas are benign nerve sheath tumors that appear as firm, rubbery masses and are often associated with NF1, a genetic condition marked by multiple neural tumors, caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, and axillary/inguinal freckling.</li><li>\u2022 Clinical Characteristics :</li><li>\u2022 Clinical Characteristics</li><li>\u2022 Presence of a painless, lateral neck mass in a pediatric patient.

This results in uncontrolled cell growth, leading to the formation of neurofibromas and other characteristic lesions of NF1.</li><li>\u2022 Pathophysiology</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Lipoblastoma: This option is incorrect because lipoblastomas are benign soft tissue tumors derived from embryonic fat, commonly presenting as soft, lobulated masses.

Lipoblastoma:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Branchial cleft cyst: This option is incorrect as branchial cleft cysts are congenital neck masses that are soft, fluctuant, and often become infected, presenting with pain and drainage.

Abdominal ultrasound is used to diagnose biliary stones and bile duct dilatations in cholangitis. Treatment for cholangitis includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, rehydration, and biliary drainage using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

The decision to perform a pelvic X-ray is based on clinical evaluation, mechanism of injury, and signs of hemodynamic instability suggestive of pelvic trauma. The primary survey focuses on quickly identifying life-threatening conditions using imaging tools like FAST ultrasound and chest X-rays, reserving pelvic X-rays for patients with specific indications rather than as a routine for all.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. FAST ultrasound is a rapid tool for detecting internal bleeding in trauma patients: This statement is true. The FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) exam is a critical part of the primary survey, used to detect free fluid in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis, indicating internal bleeding, and guiding urgent management decisions.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. FAST ultrasound is a rapid tool for detecting internal bleeding in trauma patients:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Chest X-ray is used to identify critical chest injuries such as pneumothorax or hemothorax: This statement is true. Chest X-rays are commonly performed during the primary survey to rapidly assess for life-threatening thoracic injuries like pneumothorax, hemothorax, and rib fractures, which require immediate attention.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Chest X-ray is used to identify critical chest injuries such as pneumothorax or hemothorax:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Whole-body CT scans are typically performed once the patient is stabilized for a comprehensive evaluation: This statement is true. Whole-body CT scans provide a detailed evaluation of trauma patients but are usually reserved for the secondary survey once the patient is stable, due to the time required and the need for patient immobility during the scan.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Whole-body CT scans are typically performed once the patient is stabilized for a comprehensive evaluation:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 During the primary survey in trauma patients, imaging is focused on rapid identification of life-threatening conditions using tools like FAST ultrasound and chest X-rays.
