Repetition is usually impaired. Peak atrophy sites - Temporoparietal junction Posterior temporal lobe partially overlapping with the traditional location of Wernicke\u2019s area. However, the comprehension impairment of Wernicke\u2019s aphasia is absent probably because the underlying deep white matter , frequently damaged by CVAs , remains relatively intact in PPA. The repetition impairment suggests that parts of Wernicke\u2019s area are critical for phonological loop functionality . In contrast to Broca\u2019s aphasia or agrammatic PPA , the interruption of fluency is variable so speech may appear entirely normal if the patient is allowed to engage in small talk. Logopenic PPA resembles anomic aphasia but usually has longer and more frequent word-finding pauses. When repetition is impaired, the aphasia resembles the conduction aphasia.

The impairments of language in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) have slightly different patterns from those seen in CVA-caused aphasias. For example, the full syndrome of Wernicke\u2019s aphasia is almost never seen in PPA, confirming the view that sentence comprehension and word comprehension are controlled by different regions of the language network. Three major subtypes of PPA can be recognized. 1)Semantic PPA- preserved fluency and syntax (word order) poor single-word comprehension profound two-way naming impairments Neuronal loss- left anterior temporal lobe Resembles- Wernicke\u2019s aphasia or posterior transcortical aphasia speech is usually informative and repetition is intact in semantic PPA while Wernicke's has \u2018jargon speech\u2019. 2)Agrammatic PPA- consistently low fluency impaired grammar but intact word comprehension. Neuronal loss- left inferior frontal gyrus Resembles- Broca\u2019s aphasia or anterior transcortical aphasia But Agrammatic PPA usually lacks the right hemiparesis or dysarthria 3)Logopenic PPA- preserved syntax and comprehension frequent and severe word-finding pauses, anomia, circumlocutions, and simplifications during spontaneous speech. Repetition is usually impaired. Neuronal loss- Temporoparietal junction Posterior temporal lobe Resembles- Anomic aphasia but Logopenic PPA usually has longer and more frequent word-finding pauses.</p>\n<p></p>",

The net effect of the underlying lesion is to interrupt the flow of information from the auditory association cortex to the language network. Patients have no difficulty understanding written language and can express themselves well in spoken or written language. Interpreting and reacting to environmental sounds if the primary auditory cortex and auditory association areas of the right hemisphere are spared. Because auditory information can not be conveyed to the language network, It cannot be decoded into neural word representations, and the patient reacts to speech as if it were in an alien tongue that cannot be deciphered. Patients cannot repeat spoken language but have no difficulty naming objects. In time, patients with pure word deafness teach themselves lipreading and may appear to have improved. There may be no additional neurologic findings, but agitated paranoid reactions are common in the acute stages.

This kind of aphasia is not seen with CVAs. It differs from Wernicke\u2019s aphasia or posterior transcortical aphasia because speech is usually informative and repetition is intact in semantic PPA. Comprehension of sentences is relatively preserved if the meaning is not too dependent on words that fail to be understood, allowing the patient to surmise the gist of the conversation through contextual cues.
