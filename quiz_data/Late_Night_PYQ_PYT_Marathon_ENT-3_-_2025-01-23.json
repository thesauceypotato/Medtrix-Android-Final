D) Air travelling is a contraindication for surgery</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The patient, being pregnant and experiencing worsening hearing loss, suggests otosclerosis. The provided PTA (Pure Tone Audiogram) shows a significant air-bone gap on the right side, indicating conductive hearing loss, which is consistent with otosclerosis.</li><li>\u2022 Definitely, air travel is contraindicated for patients post-stapedectomy for at least three months. The variations in middle ear pressure during ascent and descent can lead to displacement or dislocation of the prosthetic piston used in the surgery, making this statement true.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Ad Type of tympanogram is obtained: In otosclerosis, an As type of tympanogram (indicating reduced compliance of the middle ear system) is typically obtained, not Ad. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Ad Type of tympanogram is obtained:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Notch at 2000Hz is indicative of Noise Induced hearing loss: A notch at 2000Hz on bone conduction is known as Carhart's notch, which is indicative of otosclerosis, not noise-induced hearing loss. Noise-induced hearing loss typically presents a notch at 4000Hz. Hence, this statement is incorrect.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Notch at 2000Hz is indicative of Noise Induced hearing loss:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Associated M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is not a contraindication for stapes surgery: M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is indeed a contraindication for stapes surgery. The presence of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease can lead to complications such as irritation of the saccule during the surgery, causing vertigo and giddiness. Thus, this statement is false.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

A) Traumatic CSF Rhinorrhea</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The patient presents with mild bloody rhinorrhea, and the drainage has created a characteristic \"halo sign\" or \"double ring sign\" on his shirt. This sign indicates the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mixed with blood. The halo sign is seen when CSF forms a clear ring around a central bloody spot on absorbent material. This finding is indicative of traumatic CSF rhinorrhea, where trauma causes a breach in the meninges, allowing CSF to leak and mix with nasal secretions or blood.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Spontaneous CSF Rhinorrhea: Spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea typically involves clear CSF leakage without blood. The absence of blood would not produce the halo sign as described.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Spontaneous CSF Rhinorrhea:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Meningocele: Meningocele involves herniation of the meninges through a defect in the skull or spinal column but does not typically cause nasal CSF leakage mixed with blood. It usually presents as a mass or bulge.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Meningocele:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Tumors: Tumors might cause nasal discharge, but the presence of a halo sign specifically points to a CSF leak, which is more characteristic of traumatic causes rather than tumors.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
