The following points support this diagnosis:</li><li>\u2022 Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) dissection</li><li>\u2022 History : Chiropractic manipulation or vigorous neck movements can cause a tear in the intimal layer of the ICA, leading to dissection. Patients typically present with acute neck pain and dizziness due to compromised blood flow to the brain. Imaging findings : The DSA image shows an abrupt narrowing of the ICA, a hallmark feature of dissection. This is caused by blood accumulating between the layers of the arterial wall, leading to stenosis or occlusion. Management: The primary treatment for ICA dissection is endovascular stenting , which restores blood flow through the artery and prevents further ischemic events.</li><li>\u2022 History : Chiropractic manipulation or vigorous neck movements can cause a tear in the intimal layer of the ICA, leading to dissection.

B) Typical carcinoid</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Typical carcinoids are well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors that exhibit low metabolic activity. As a result, they are often FDG-PET negative or show minimal uptake due to their low glycolytic activity. Typical carcinoids are less aggressive than atypical carcinoids and other neuroendocrine tumors.</li><li>\u2022 Typical carcinoids</li><li>\u2022 FDG-PET negative</li><li>\u2022 FDG-PET is commonly used to assess tumor metabolism. While more aggressive and poorly differentiated tumors demonstrate high uptake due to increased glycolysis, well-differentiated tumors like typical carcinoids are less metabolically active and may not show significant FDG uptake.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
