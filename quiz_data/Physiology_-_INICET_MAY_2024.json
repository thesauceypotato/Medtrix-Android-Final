This may result from ureteral constriction</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>A major measure of kidney function is the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The glomerular filtration rate is the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. The creatinine clearance rate (CCr or CrCl) is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine per unit time and is a useful measure for approximating the GFR. Estimated GFR (eGFR) is now recommended by clinical practice guidelines and regulatory agencies for routine evaluation of GFR whereas measured GFR (mGFR) is recommended as a confirmatory test when more accurate assessment is required</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Increases in the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure cause increases in net filtration pressure and GFR Option: C. Decreased colloidal osmotic pressure, most notably seen in hypoalbuminemia, can cause edema and decrease in blood volume as fluid is not reabsorbed into the bloodstream Option: D. An important interplay between RBF and proper kidney functioning is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, also known as RAAS. Renin is secreted by juxtaglomerular cells in response to decreased renal arterial pressure, increased renal sympathetic activation from beta-1 adrenergic receptors, or decreased sodium delivery to macula densa cells</p>\n<p></p>",

The inactive or inhibitory form exists when the complex consists of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, with GDP bound to the alpha subunit In order to become active, a ligand must bind to the receptor and cause a conformational change.

The relationship between preload and contractility is a relationship between length and tension, because: Preload results in an increased sarcomere length. As preload increases, contractility (tension generated by the cardiac myocytes) increases. After an action potential initiates, the cardiac cell is unable to initiate another action potential for some duration of time (which is slightly shorter than the \"true\" action potential duration).

Stage 2 is still light sleep, but deeper than stage 1. During this stage, your brain waves slow down and have noticeable pauses between short, powerful bursts of electrical activity. Experts think those bursts are your brain organizing memories and information from the time you spent awake. Option: B. Stage 1 NREM sleep is the lightest stage of sleep. You enter stage 1 right after you fall asleep. This stage usually lasts only a few minutes, making up about 5% of your sleep time. After that, your sleep gets deeper, and you move into stage 2 NREM sleep. Option: D. The deepest stage of NREM sleep is stage 3. It makes up about 25% of your total sleep time in adults. But babies and children need more stage 3 sleep, and the older you get, the less you need. In stage 3, your brain waves are slow but strong.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA STAGES OF SLEEP STAGE BEHAVIOUR EEG NREM 1 Light sleep, easily aroused by stimuli Mixed frequency waves (predominantly 2-7Hz). NREM 2 Further lack of sensitivity to activation and arousal Predominant theta activity (4-7 Hz) K complex and sleep spindles. NREM 3 Deep sleep Delta>theta activity REM(Paradoxical sleep) Dream occurs, Rapid eye movements occurs 50-90 mins after sleep onset, episodes repeated after 60-90 min, each episode lasting about 10 mins. Saw tooth waves. EEG resembles that of awake state.</p>\n<p></p>",

Aldosterone secretion is primarily controlled through a renal pathway. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone produced by the zona fasciculata that plays several important roles in the body. The adrenal cortex is made up of inner, middle and outer layers. Aldosterone is produced in the outer layer. Cortisol, androgen and estrogen are produced in the inner layer (active zone) and stored in the middle layer (storage zone). The cortex produces steroid hormones including glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens, and the medulla produces the catecholamines, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Other options are incorrect and self explanatory</p>\n<p></p>",
