MODY is a monogenic form of diabetes mellitus that is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. It affects young adults 25 years of age. It occurs due to reduced insulin secretion. Etiological factors of type 1 and 2 diabetes such as insulin resistance, obesity, and antibodies are not associated with this condition. Stable hyperglycemia is usually seen, hence complications like diabetic ketoacidosis are uncommon. Macrovascular complications like hyperlipidemia or hypertension are not seen. It is treated with insulin and sulfonylureas.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Type 1 DM - Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by mistake) . This reaction destroys the cells in the pancreas that make insulin, called beta cells. This process can go on for months or years before any symptoms appear. So it usually occurs in older individuals. Option: B. Type 2 DM - is associated with insulin resistance which leads to hyperglycemia. Option: D. LADA - The cause of LADA is the development of autoantibodies against pancreatic cells, insulin, or enzymes involved in pancreatic functions. Antibodies affecting the pancreas and its function may influence the way the body responds to blood sugar.</p>\n<p></p>",
