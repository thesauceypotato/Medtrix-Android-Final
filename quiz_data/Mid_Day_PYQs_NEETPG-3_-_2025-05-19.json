The score consists of six neuromuscular criteria (posture, square window, arm recoil, popliteal angle, scarf sign, and heel to ear) and six physical maturity criteria (skin, lanugo, plantar surface, breast, eye/ear, and genitalia).

Sporothrix schenckii primarily causes sporotrichosis, which is typically a cutaneous infection that follows traumatic inoculation of the fungus into the skin, often through rose thorns or splinters (hence its nickname \"rose gardener's disease\").

Mucor species (causing mucormycosis) are increasingly recognized as important opportunistic fungi in immunocompromised children, particularly those with diabetic ketoacidosis, prolonged neutropenia, or those receiving deferoxamine therapy.

Intussusception is a condition where one segment of intestine telescopes into another segment, causing intestinal obstruction. The original RotaShield vaccine showed an association with intussusception at a rate of approximately 1 case per 10,000 vaccinated infants, with most cases occurring within 1 week of the first dose. This led to its voluntary withdrawal.

These autoantibodies cross the placenta during pregnancy and can affect the developing fetal cardiac conduction system, particularly the atrioventricular (AV) node. The maternal anti-Ro antibodies can cause inflammation and subsequent fibrosis of the fetal cardiac conduction system, resulting in complete heart block. The risk of developing congenital heart block is approximately 2% in anti-Ro positive mothers, but increases to about 15-20% if there is a previous child with neonatal lupus.

Autism</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Asperger's Syndrome - Incorrect. Asperger's Syndrome is characterized by normal language development with social communication difficulties and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior.
