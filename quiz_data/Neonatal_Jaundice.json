Light emitting diodes (LED) has the advantage of long life (up to 50,000 hours) and is capable of delivering higher irradiance than Compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) lamps The lamps should be changed, if the lamps are flickering or ends are blackened, if irradiance falls below the specified level. For phototherapy to be effective bilirubin must be present in the skin, so no role in prophylactic phototherapy.</p>\n<p></p>",
