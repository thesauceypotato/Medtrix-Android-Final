      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1 The given case history and findings point towards the diagnosis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy . Refractive status, as myopia carries an increased risk of POAG and hypermetropia in primary angle - closure glaucoma ( PACG ). Myopic disc with glaucoma, as seen in the first image, refers to a tilted (obliquely inserted), shallow disc with a temporal crescent of para papillary atrophy, together with features of glaucomatous damage. Optic disc haemorrhage can be seen in the second image . An optic disc haemorrhage is a risk factor for the development and progression of glaucoma and can be missed unless magnification is used to examine the disc. Pathological cupping is caused by an irreversible decrease in the number of nerve fibres, glial cells, and blood vessels. A documented increase in cup size is always significant. If an eye with a small optic disc and correspondingly small cup develops glaucoma, the cup will increase in size, but even in the presence of substantial damage. may still be smaller than that of a large physiological cup. This form of the disease is characterized by markedly elevated pressures , often >40 mm Hg, and a poor response to medication.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Other cloned genes known to be associated with glaucoma include PAX6 (11p13, aniridia), CYP1B1 (2p21, congenital glaucoma), PITX2 (4q25, Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome), and LMX1B (9q34, glaucoma associated with nail-patella syndrome).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. 3 - Not the correct option.
