Thoracic aortic dissection is commonly divided according to the Stanford classification into Type A (involving the ascending aorta or aortic arch) and Type B (involving the descending thoracic aorta only).

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Monophasic flow In Ultrasonography and Doppler investigations sound waves which are produced in the transducer are used to obtain images. In Doppler study, Doppler effect is used which is defined as the change in frequency of sound wave due to a reflector moving towards or away from an object, the transducer is object and RBCs in the vessels act as reflectors in case of Doppler study of vessels. The color coding is used to show the direction of blood flow, for example the flow towards the transducer can be coded as red and away from it coded as blue.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The spectral wave form depicts the velocity changes in the vessel corresponding to the cardiac cycle. The velocity in the normal peripheral arteries increases during systole, attains a peak, goes below baseline (called as reversal during late systole or early diastole) and again comes above the base line (forward flow in late diastole), called as triphasic. If the waveform is seen on the one side of baseline throughout the cardiac cycle without reversal, it is called as monophasic. Peripheral arterial disease with severe stenosis shows monophasic pattern with spectral broadening and increased peak systolic velocity and Parvus-tardus pattern (slow rise time, flattened (or rounded) peak, absent dicrotic notch, and concave- down distal waveform). Normal triphasic wave pattern</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option A. Biphasic flow; The biphasic type describes a two-phase Doppler waveform with an extension of the reverse flow phase during the whole diastole and the disappearance of the forward flow phase during diastole, in comparison with the triphasic type. Option C. Triphasic flow; triphasic: having three phases, due to crossing the zero flow baseline twice in each cardiac cycle. systolic forward flow. early diastolic flow reversal (below zero velocity baseline) late diastolic forward flow (slower than in systole) Option D. Turbulent flow;</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>A multiphasic waveform (triphasic, biphasic) crosses the zero-flow baseline and contains both forward and reverse velocity components.

Subdural hemorrhage; A subdural hemorrhage (hematoma) usually occurs because of a severe head injury. It takes place when blood vessels burst between the brain and the leather-like membrane that wraps around the brain (the dura mater). Option C. Intracerebral hemorrhage; Intracranial hemorrhage encompasses four broad types of hemorrhage: epidural hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage Option D. Subarachnoid hemorrhage; A subarachnoid hemorrhage means that there is bleeding in the space that surrounds the brain.

The source of bleeding is usually arterial, most commonly from a torn middle meningeal artery.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
