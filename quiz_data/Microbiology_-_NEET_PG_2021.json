Leishmaniasis is caused by protozoan parasites which are transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. Leishmania exists in non-flagellated amastigote form (with nucleus and kinetoplast) and flagellated promastigote form.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>There are 3 main forms of leishmaniases \u2013 visceral (also known as kala-azar, which is and the most serious form of the disease), cutaneous (the most common), and mucocutaneous. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar is fatal if left untreated in over 95% of cases. It is characterized by irregular bouts of fever, weight loss, enlargement of the spleen and liver, and anaemia. Most cases occur in Brazil, East Africa and in India. It remains one of the top parasitic diseases with outbreak and mortality potential. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most common form of leishmaniasis and causes skin lesions, mainly ulcers, on exposed parts of the body, leaving life-long scars and serious disability or stigma. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis leads to partial or total destruction of mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat. The life cycle of Leishmania species: Sandflies inject infective promastigotes into a susceptible mammal during feeding. Promastigotes are phagocytosed by resident phagocytes, transform into tissue-stage amastigotes, and multiply within these cells through simple The parasite continues to infect phagocytic cells either at the site of cutaneous infection or in secondary lymphoid organs, with eventual parasitemia. Sandflies become infected through feeding on a host either with an active skin lesion in CL or with parasitemia in VL. Parasites convert to promastigotes within the sandfly midgut. Promastigotes migrate from the midgut and transform into highly infectious metacyclic promastigotes.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Prozone phenomenon A false negative response can be observed due to prozone phenomenon due to high antibody titers which interferes with lattice formation for visualization of a positive test. The problem can be overcome by testing in appropriate dilutions. Prozone phenomenon may occur secondary to hyper antigenemia, possibly leading to false-negative results. Accordingly, routine dilution of sera (typically beyond 1:320) is necessary to avoid this problem. At high antibody concentrations, the number of antibody binding sites may greatly exceed the number of epitopes present in the antigens. As a result, most antibodies bind antigen only univalently instead of multivalent. Antibodies that bind univalently cannot cross-link one antigen to another. Excess of an antibody also inhibits agglutination reaction; this inhibition is called prozone phenomenon.</p>\n<p></p>",

However, individuals and parents tend to forget about prior history as they grow older and reach adulthood. Thus, definite history alone cannot be a true indicator of immunity for chickenpox. Screening for the presence of IgG antibodies for Varicella virus is a useful method to assess the immunity against the same. Presence of IgG antibodies against Varicella indicates immunity, and conversely, its absence indicates susceptibility. Indirect immunoenzyme assay kit to test IgG antibodies against Varicella virus is available.</p>\n<p></p>",

Japanese Encephalitis is a viral infection caused by RNA viruses belonging to the Flavivirus It is a zoonosis \u2013 an animal disease that can spread to humans \u2013 primarily transmitted by evening biting Culex mosquitoes that feed on infected birds, pigs and other mammals passing the infection to humans living and working in rural areas around rice paddies and irrigation systems. Live attenuated SA-14-14-2 vaccine against Japanese encephalitis (JE) was introduced in the routine immunization under Universal Immunization Program in the 181 endemic districts of India. Recently, the Government of India has announced the introduction of one dose of JE vaccine for adults in endemic districts. Vaccination is recommended for persons travelling extensively in rural areas, long-term travelers, and persons on work assignments in endemic areas.</p>\n<p></p>",

Post flood/earthquake situation where Doxycycline used as prophylaxis is indicative of a leptospirosis outbreak. Prevention and Control: Personal protection: Hygienic methods such as avoidance of direct and indirect human contact animal urine are recommended as preventive measures. Workers in flooded fields should be cautioned against direct contact with contaminated water or mud and should be advised to use rubber shoes and gloves. In case of any cuts or abrasion on the lower extremities of the body, the worker should apply an antiseptic ointment. Health education: The main preventive measure for leptospirosis is to create awareness about the disease and its prevention. This has to be conceptualized through intensive educational campaigns. Chemoprophylaxis: During the peak transmission season Doxycycline 200 mg, once a week, may be given to agricultural workers, canal cleaning workers from where clustering of cases has been reported. The chemoprophylaxis should be for six weeks and never to be extended for more than eight weeks. Rodent control: Usage of rat poison such as Zn Phosphide for rodent control</p>\n<p></p>",
