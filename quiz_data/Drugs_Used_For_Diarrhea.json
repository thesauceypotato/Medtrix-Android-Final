Several Enterobacteriaceae can cause travelers\u2019 diarrhea, varying according to the area of travel. Bismuth subsalicylate is effective in patients with diarrhea caused by E. coli, Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter jejune, and Salmonella species and also inhibits enteric secretions.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A . Magnesium sulfate is an osmotic laxative and therefore is contraindicated in the treatment of diarrhea. Option: C, D. These antibiotics are not effective against Enterobacteriaceae.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Octreotide Reason-Octreotide is a somatostatin analog. When given in pharmacological amounts, somatostatin inhibits virtually all exocrine and endocrine secretions of the pancreas (insulin, glucagon, and pancreatic enzymes), stomach (gastrin), and intestine (secretin, motilin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide [VIP], gastric inhibitory polypeptide [GIP], and serotonin), as well as secretion of growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Because of this, octreotide is used to reduce symptoms caused by a variety of hormone-secreting tumors.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Somatostatin Analogues Octreotide:300-600 mcg/24h by SC. Mechanism of action: \u27a4 Somatostatin is produced in intestinal D cells. \u27a4 Act on gut epithelial receptor s to inhibit secretion & peristalsis. \u27a4 It acts as inhibitor of growth hormone, Glucagon ,& Insulin. \u27a4 Treat refractory diarrhea & Carcinoid syndrome, bowel obstruction, vasoactive intestinal peptide -secreting tumors.alliative Advantages vs Dis advantages: \u27a4 Can be given once a month.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. somatotropin hormone The main effect of GH is to promote linear growth in children.
