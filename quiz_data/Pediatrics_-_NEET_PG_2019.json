      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Males have IQ 20-40 Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X syndrome is associated with a fragile site on chromosome X (Xq 29.3) Triple nucleotide CGG Sequence mutation Individuals with FXS may present anywhere on a continuum from learning disabilities in the context of a normal intelligence quotient (IQ) to severe intellectual disability, with an average IQ of 40 in males who have complete silencing of the FMR1 gene. Fragile sites are regions of chromosomes that show a tendency to separation breakage or attenuation tinder particular growth conditions. Fragile X syndrome is the: MC inherited cause of MENTAL RETARDATION Second MC genetic cause of mental Retardation after Down syndrome Inheritance Inheritance does not follow the usual Mendelian single gene patterns It is due to Allelic expansion. Clinical Manifestations: The main clinical manifestations are: Mental Retardation Macroorchidism Characteristic facial appearance with: Long face Large prominent ears Prominent Jaw</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Chromosomal abnormalities are thought to be the most common cause of mental retardation. About 10% of cases of mental retardation are due to c hromosomal abnormalities. Overall among the genetic causes of mental retardation, almost 30% are probably the result of mutations located in the X chromosome (X-linked mental retardation). The two most important genetic disorders that contribute to mental retardation are Down syndrome followed by Fragile X syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Fragile X syndrome is caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene, specifically in the CGG trinucleotide repeat sequence. Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked genetic disorder, which means it primarily affects males. However, females can also be carriers and may exhibit milder symptoms. Intellectual disability is a common characteristic of Fragile X syndrome, and in males, the intellectual disability typically ranges from mild to severe, with an average IQ of around 40. The mutation in the FMR1 gene leads to a loss of function, resulting in the absence of the FMR1 protein, which is necessary for normal brain development.</p>\n<p></p>",

The aortic attachment of the ductus arteriosus is just distal to the left subclavian artery. A simpler way to detect this shunting is to use two pulse oximeters and measure pre-ductal and post ductal Spo2.
