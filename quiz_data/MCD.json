      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All of the above Effacement of foot processes can be seen in minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy, and diabetic nephropathy .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Minimal change disease (MCD): A kidney disease that causes proteinuria, edema, and low levels of protein in the blood. Effacement of foot processes is a characteristic feature seen in MCD. Option: B. Membranous nephropathy (MN): A glomerular disease that is characterized by the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane due to the deposition of immune complexes. Effacement of foot processes can be seen in some cases of MN. Option: C. Diabetic nephropathy: A kidney disease that affects people with diabetes. It is characterized by damage to the glomeruli, leading to proteinuria, hypertension, and progressive renal failure. Effacement of foot processes is a late finding in diabetic nephropathy and is associated with the development of proteinuria.</p>\n<p></p>",
