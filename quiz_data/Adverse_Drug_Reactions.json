This X-linked monogenic trait is more common in the Mediterranean, African and Southeast Asian races. The hemolysis is largely dose related. Several variants of the G-6PD gene occur in the population resulting in differing severity of hemolysis triggered by different oxidizing drugs.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option:B. Cotrimoxazole : Sulfamethoxazole+Trimethoprim is a combination medicine that is used to treat various types of bacterial infections such as pneumonia, bronchitis, infections of the urinary tract, ear, and abdomen. It prevents the growth of microorganisms to cure the disease. Option:C. Furazolidone is an antibiotic medicine used to treat diarrhea caused by bacteria or protozoa. Option:D. Nalidixic acid It has historically been used for treating urinary tract infections, caused, for example, by Escherichia coli , Proteus , Shigella , Enterobacter , and Klebsiella . It is no longer clinically used for this indication in the USA as less toxic and more effective agents are available. The marketing authorization for nalidixic acid has been suspended throughout the EU .</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Side effect</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Unwanted but often unavoidable Pharmacodynamic effects Occur at therapeutic doses Not serious Predicted from the pharmacological profile of a drug A side effect may be based on the same action as the therapeutic effect, e.g. atropine is used in pre-anesthetic medication for its antisecretory action. The same action produces dryness of the mouth as a side effect. Glyceryl trinitrate relieves angina pectoris by dilating peripheral vasculature which is also responsible for postural hypotension and throbbing headache. The side effect may also be based on a different facet of action, e.g. promethazine produces sedation unrelated to its antiallergic action; estrogens cause nausea which is unrelated to their antiovulatory action. An effect may be therapeutic in one context but a side effect in another context, e.g. codeine used for cough produces constipation as a side effect, but the latter is its therapeutic effect in traveler\u2019s diarrhea; depression of A-V conduction is the desired effect of digoxin in atrial fibrillation, but the same may be undesirable when it is used for CHF.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option:A. Secondary effect adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention, such as surgery. An adverse effect may be termed a \"side effect\" when judged to be secondary to a main or therapeutic effect. The term complication is similar to adverse effect. Option:D. Adverse drug event In adverse drug reactions involving overdoses, the toxic effect is simply an extension of the pharmacological effect (Type A adverse drug reactions). On the other hand, clinical symptoms of idiosyncratic drug reactions (Type B adverse drug reactions) are different from the pharmacological effect of the drug.</p>\n<p></p>",

Voluntary reporting depends on the initiative and willingness of the health professionals. It is minimal in India, while even in developed countries only ~10% of ADRs are reported voluntarily. Immediately occurring reactions and those that are dramatic are mostly reported. Though even rare reactions can be detected by this method, it does not provide an incidence of the reaction. Dissemination of ADR data through \u2018drug alerts\u2019, \u2018medical letters\u2019, and advisories sent to doctors by pharmaceuticals and regulatory agencies (such as the FDA in the USA, and the Committee on Safety of Medicines in the UK).
