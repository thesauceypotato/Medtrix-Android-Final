Diagnosis of RA is based on clinical features, laboratory tests (such as rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies), and imaging studies.

Ankylosing spondylitis . Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of inflammatory arthritis that mainly affects the spine, causing stiffness, pain, and eventually fusion of the vertebrae. Diagnosis of AS involves clinical features, imaging studies (like X-rays showing syndesmophytes), and sometimes blood tests. A diagnosis of AS can usually be confirmed if an X-ray shows sacroiliitis and there is at least 1 of the following :</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

Reactive synovitis. Reactive synovitis refers to inflammation of the synovial membrane in response to an infection elsewhere in the body, often in the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. It is not a specific term used for a well-defined rheumatological condition. Diagnosis involves assessing the clinical context, including symptoms and potential triggers of the inflammation. According to American College of Rheumatology, there are 2 major and 2 minor diagnostic guidelines of reactive arthritis. Major guidelines includes a symmetric oligo or monoarthritis involving lower extremities, and either enteritis or urethritis symptoms preceding the onset of arthritis by a time interval of 3 days to 6 weeks. Minor guidelines includes presence of a triggering infection as evidenced by culture positivity, and presence of persistent synovial involvement.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Titanium is a biocompatible material commonly used in orthopedic implants.

Several factors can contribute to the development of ankle OA, including injury, genetics, and mechanical stress. Weight bearing is a significant mechanical stressor on the ankle joint. Over time, repetitive loading and impact on the joint during weight-bearing activities can lead to wear and tear of the cartilage in the ankle joint, eventually resulting in the development of osteoarthritis in the ankle.

Parathyroid adenoma is a benign tumor of the parathyroid gland that can lead to overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Elevated levels of PTH can result in increased calcium levels in the blood, leading to conditions like hyperparathyroidism. While hyperparathyroidism can affect the bones and joints, it typically does not present with the sudden, acute joint pain.
