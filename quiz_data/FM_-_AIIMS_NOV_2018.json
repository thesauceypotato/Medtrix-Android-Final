They are most useful in identifying the make and model of the gun involved. Secondary markings / Individual markings / Bullet finger-printings - Secondary markings or individual characteristics are produced on the surface of the bullet by imperfection on the inner surface of the barrel. These irregularities are produced by sticking particles of bullet to the bore when shots are fired and is known as Metallic fouling . They also result accidentally during the manufacturing process . They are useful in identifying the specific gun which was fired.

Mechanism: Caused when there is lateral friction of skin against rough surface. Simple injuries which bleed less, heal rapidly without any formation of scars. Types : 4 types Scratch Graze Pressure Imprint Scratch : Scratch is a linear abrasion which has a significant length and insignificant breadth /width. Very superficial incised wounds. Eg: Fingernail scratch Graze : C type of abrasion C type of abrasion in RTA Produced when a larger area of skin is frictioned against a large rough surface. Eg : Body is dragged along road Multiple small linear abrasions, tip of these abrasions have epidermal skin Indicates direction of force. Pressure Abrasions: The force causing the abrasion is perpendicular to skin and exerted for a long time. Smaller force exerted for a long time. Eg : ligature mark, bite marks Imprint / Impact Abrasions : They are produced when a larger force is applied perpendicular to the skin for a short interval (momentarily). Eg : Tyre marks, marks of radiator grill,headlamp Age of Abrasion- Fresh \u2013 Bright red 12 \u2013 24 hrs \u2013 Bright red scab 2 \u2013 3 days \u2013 Reddish brown scab 4 \u2013 7 days \u2013 Brownish black scab >7 days \u2013 Scab falls \u2013 Depigmented area.</p>\n<p></p>",
