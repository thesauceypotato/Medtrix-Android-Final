      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Bulimia Nervosa The key features suggesting diagnosis of Bulimia Nervosa include an irresistible urge to eat followed by episodes of self-induced vomiting. The patient's use of appetite suppressants may indicate an attempt to control weight. These features are characteristic of bulimia nervosa, which is an eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors such as vomiting, laxative use, or excessive exercise.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Bulimia nervosa commonly occurs in adolescent and young adult females. Patients with bulimia nervosa often have a normal body weight or may be slightly overweight. This can be used to differentiate between bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa purging type where there will be low body weight and BMI<18.5 in the latter.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Anorexia Nervosa: Anorexia nervosa is characterized by restrictive eating leading to significantly low body weight and characterized by a distorted body image, with an unwarranted fear of being overweight. Option C. Anxiety Disorder: While anxiety disorders can manifest with various symptoms, the presence of cravings and self-induced vomiting is not specific to anxiety disorders alone. Option D. Binge Eating Disorder: Binge eating disorder involves recurrent episodes of binge eating without compensatory behaviors like vomiting. The presence of self-induced vomiting in this case points more towards bulimia nervosa.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>DSM-5 criteria for bulimia nervosa include binge eating episodes occurring at least once a week for three months, a sense of lack of control during binge eating, and recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain. Individuals with bulimia nervosa often experience shame and guilt related to their eating behaviors.</p>\n<p></p>",
