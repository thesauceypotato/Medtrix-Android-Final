RELEVANT ANATOMY Blood supply to the talus: This is the only bone of the foot without any muscle attachment. The main blood supply to the talus is from the anastomotic ring of blood vessels, the osseous vessels entering its neck and running postero-laterally within the bone to supply its body. Therefore, blood supply to the body of the talus is often cut off following fractures occurring through the neck. MECHANISM Fracture of the neck of the talus results from forced dorsiflexion of the ankle (Fig-21.16). Typically, this injury is sustained in an aircraft crash where the rudder bar is driven forcibly against the middle of the sole of the foot (Aviator's fracture), resulting in forced dorsiflexion of the ankle; the neck, being a weak area, gives way. This may be associated with dislocation of the body of the talus backwards, out of the ankle-mortise. Vascularity of the body of the talus may be compromised. Mechanism of injury of fracture neck of the talus DIAGNOSIS Unless carefully examined on a lateral X-ray of the ankle, this fracture is frequently missed because of the overlapping of the tarsal bones. TREATMENT It depends upon the displacement. If undisplaced, a below-knee plaster cast for 8-10 weeks is sufficient. In a displaced fracture, open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture with a screw is required. COMPLICATIONS Avascular necrosis and non-union: Because of the poor blood supply, after a fracture through the neck, the body of the talus becomes avascular. The avascular fragment fails to unite with rest of the bone and gradually collapses, leading to deformation of the bone, and eventually osteoarthritis of the ankle. Osteoarthritis: Besides avascular necrosis of the talus, an associated injury to its articular cartilage may lead to osteoarthritis of the ankle. The patient complains of pain and stiffness. Treatment is mostly by physiotherapy and fomentation. In severe cases, an ankle arthrodesis may be needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Internal tibial torsion Option: C. Internal tibial torsion does not present with an increased Q-angle.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Q-Angle It is formed by the line of pull of the quadriceps mechanism and that of the patellar tendon as they intersect at the center of the patella. This angle is represented by the intersection of a line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the center of the patella with a second line drawn from the center of the tibial tuberosity to the center of the patella. For accurate measurement, the patella is centered on the trochlea by flexing the knee 30 degrees. Normal angle in males 8 to 10 degrees; in females, the normal angle is 15 degrees \u00b1 5 degrees. The factors that can increase this Q angle are genu valgum, increased femoral anteversion, external tibial torsion, a laterally positioned tibial tuberosity, and a tight lateral retinaculum. The factors that increase the Q angle can be a contributing factor in recurrent patellar dislocation Q-angle is the angle formed between the lines joining the ASIS to centre of patella and ano ther line from centre of patella to tibial tubercle. It is increased in genu valgum, femoral anteversion and external tibial torsion. Normal value \u2013 8-10 degrees in males 10- 17 degrees in females</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Q-angle is the angle formed between the lines joining the ASIS to the center of patella and another line from center of patella to tibial tubercle Femoral anteversion presents with an increased Q-angle. Option: B. External tibial torsion presents with an increased Q-angle Option: D. Genu valgum presents with an increased Q-angle</p>\n<p></p>",
