Aetiology: Viral infection (parainfluenza type I and II) affecting children between 6 months and 3 years of age. Male > Female. Secondary bacterial infection by Gram-positive cocci soon supervenes. Pathology : The loose areolar tissue in the subglottic region swells up and causes respiratory obstruction and stridor. If coupled with thick tenacious secretions and crusts, may completely occlude the airway. Symptoms: Presents as upper respiratory infection with hoarseness and croupy/barking cough. Fever of 39\u201340 \u00b0C. Difficulty in breathing and inspiratory/biphasic type of stridor. Management: Once the diagnosis of croup is made, mist therapy, corticosteroids and epinephrine are the usual treatments. Since croup is chiefly viral in etiology, antibiotics play no role. Mist therapy (warm or cool) is thought to reduce the severity of croup by moistening the mucosa and reducing the viscosity of exudates, making coughing more productive. For patients with mild symptoms, mist therapy will suffice For more severe cases, further intervention may be required like oxygen inhalation by mask, racemic epinephrine given by nebulizer, corticosteroids and intubation or tracheostomy.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A.

The recommended hearing screening techniques are either otoacoustic emissions (OAE) testing or auditory brainstem evoked responses (ABRs). OAE testing israpid, easy to administer, inexpensive, and sensitive. It is therefore used for initial screening. Results of OAE are relatively easy to interpret. If hearing loss of more than 30-40 dB is present, OAE testing gives no response. If OAE shows no response, ABR is done as a confirmatory test. ABR test is an auditory evoked electrophysiologic response, that correlate highly with hearing.
