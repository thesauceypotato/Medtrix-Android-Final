      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Tuberculosis of shoulder joint Caries sicca is the classic dry form of tuberculosis of the shoulder where the patient presents with marked shoulder wasting and painful movement restriction. There is no pus formation or joint ankylosis as in another case.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>T.B of other joints Other joints may also be affected by T.B other than spine, hip and knee. Carries sicca: It is dry T.B of the shoulder. Dry as there is no exudate (Pus) Spina ventosa: It is T.B dactylitis (T.B of the phalanges) T.B infection of metacarpals, metatarsals and phalanges of hand and feet is known as tuberculous dactylitis. These are more common in children and usually the middle of bone in affected. The first inoculation of the infection is lodged in centre of marrow cavity and is seen as spinal shaped extension of bone Treatment The mainstary is ATT. Rest to the part in functional position and starting early exercise is promoted. Amputation may be needed in cases of ankylosis of more than joint. Healing in tuberculosis The healing in cases of tuberculosis of which ever joint it is occurs by ankylosis (pathological fusion of the joints). This ankylosis can be bony or fibrous. Investigation Radiograph For initial few days they may be negative. Later on they may show soft tissue edema, widening of the joint space. In late stages the joint destruction, osteomyelitis, Osteoarthritis or joint fusion may be seen. USG There can be used to detect fluid collection in joints CT and MRI CT may show soft tissue swelling. Joint effusion and abscess formation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is a type of osteonecrosis due to disruption of blood supply to the proximal femur. Option: C. Osteoarthritis is also known as degenerative joint disease. It is often associated with wear and tear related to aging. It can also affect other joints besides the shoulder and is the most common form of arthritis. Option: D. Frozen shoulder, also called adhesive capsulitis, involves stiffness and pain in the shoulder joint.</p>\n<p></p>",

Early arthritis The articular cartilage is involved: the spasm of muscle pulls the limb, so appear shorter Flexion, adduction, internal rotation (apparent shortening Rarefaction with osteopenia, femoral head erosions at margins, acetabulum or both, Joint  space maintained. 3. Advanced arthritis Destruction cartilage and the joint is destroyed Flexion, adduction, internal rotation, (true shortening) Along with the above features there is destruction of articular surface and reduction in joint space 4. Advanced arthritis with subluxation/dislocation (stage with sequale and complications) Flexion, adduction,  internal rotation (gross shortening Gross destruction and reduction of joint space, wandering acetabulum Difference in apparent / true shortening / lengthening When both ASIS are placed at same position then limbs are of equal length. In true shortening, when both ASIS are at same position the affected limb will be shorter as compared to the normal limb. Investigation- All investigation will be same as discussed with Pott's spine.

Route of spread may be hematogenous or from surrounding focus. Pott's spine Spine is the most common site of skeletal tuberculosis (followed by hip and knee) Any level of spine may be involved, the lower thoracic region being the most common, next in decreasing order of frequency are lumbar, upper dorsal cervical sacral region (dorsolumbar region (T11-L1) is the usually most commonly involved segment). Types of involvement of the spine Paradiscal: destruction of end plates with intervertebral disc involvement. This is the most common type of involvement. Anterior type: infection spreads under anterior longitudinal ligament and localized to anterior part of vertebral body Central: Cystic type of tuberculosis involving the body of vertebra and leads to early collapse of diseased vertebra Posterior: Pedicle, transverse process, lamina/spinous process. This type involves posterior elements of spine. Paradiscal is the most common type as the vertebra develops from the sclerotome which lie on either side of the Notochord. The lower half of upper vertebra and upper half of lower vertebra with intervening disc they have same blood supply and therefore, the most common route of spread is hematogenous, these all are involved most commonly. Pathology The involvement of contigous area of the adjaent vertebra causes destruction of the vertebra. This may causes two types of vertebral collapse Wedge collapse Concentric collapse The abscess so formed in tuberculosis is known as cold abscess and it has following features: It is due to exudative reaction There are no signs of inflammation It is composed of WBC, serum, caseous material, bone debris, tuberculosis bacilli Abscess of thoracic spine may rupture into mediastinum (bird's nest abscess) or may reach to anterior chest wall in parasternal area through intercostal vessels Other area of spread of abscess Cervical spine Para spinal region in back Post/Ant cervical triangles Along brachial plexus Along inter costal space Dorsal or Lumbar spine Iliac fossa (It's the psoas abscess which can be felt at iliac region) Lumbar triangle Below inguinal ligament May go upto knee If bilateral psoas abscess is there it can lead to bilateral hip flexion or pseudo hip flexion deformity of hip.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B.
