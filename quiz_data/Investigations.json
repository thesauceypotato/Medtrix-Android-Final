She has not noticed any changes in the right breast. She has no history of serious illness. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), her pulse is 80/min, her respirations are 13/min, and her blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. Examination shows a palpable, mobile, tender mass in the left upper quadrant of the breast. Ultrasound shows a 1.75 cm, well-circumscribed anechoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement. The patient says she is very concerned about breast cancer and wishes for further diagnostic testing. Which is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient?",

Breast cysts are almost always benign, and further diagnostic steps are not routinely required. However, symptomatic patients, such as this patient, should undergo fine needle aspiration. Fine needle aspiration can be diagnostic and therapeutic for breast cysts (e.g., aspiration of a clear, non-bloody fluid resulting in a wholly collapsed lesion).

A mammogram is indicated to evaluate breast mass in p atients > 30 years of age . In younger patients, however, breast tissue is hypersensitive to radiation exposure and very dense, thus limiting the utility of mammography. In addition, this patient's ultrasound findings suggest a simple cyst, rendering a mammogram dispensable. Option: C. Reassurance and follow-up is an appropriate approach for patients with an asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic breast cyst on ultrasound. However, further diagnostic and therapeutic steps should be performed if the patient is concerned about symptoms. Option: D. Core needle biopsy is indicated in patients with a suspicious solid breast mass on ultrasound or mammography and those with malignant features on fine needle aspiration (e.g., a mass that does not wholly resolve upon aspiration). This patient's ultrasound findings, however, suggest a benign breast cyst.</p>\n<p></p>",

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology cannot provide information about the tissue architecture or receptor status. Also, false negatives occur mainly through sampling error, and invasive cancer cannot be distinguished from in situ disease. FNAC has been superseded by a more sensitive and specific modality in patients with a palpable breast lump and suspicious findings on imaging. The primary role of FNA nowadays is the evaluation of nonsuspicious cystic lesions in women younger than 30. Option: B. Excisional biopsy (e.g., via lumpectomy) is an invasive procedure and is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosing breast cancer. It may, however, be used for diagnosis in this patient if the appropriate next step is inconclusive but imaging shows a suspicious lesion or if the appropriate next step cannot be performed (e.g., lack of facilities or expertise for ultrasound-guided procedures).

In turn, persistent or severe mastitis can lead to a focal collection of purulent fluid (abscess). Mastitis and breast abscess are typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus , which enters the breast through nipple trauma (e.g., chafing/blistering).

Lactational mastitis occurs when bacteria from the infant's nasopharynx or the maternal skin are transmitted through the nipple and multiply in stagnant milk.
