The first step following resuscitation and administration of appropriate antibiotics is to undertake urgent USG. This will demonstrate whether there is intra- or extrahepatic ductal dilatation. If a fluid collection is present in the subhepatic space, drainage catheters may be required. These can be inserted under radiological control or, if this expertise is not available, at open operation. The anatomy may need to be defined by MRCP or ERCP. The latter is undertaken when therapeutic maneuver are planned, such as the removal of an obstructing stone or the insertion of a stent across a biliary leak. Small biliary leaks will usually resolve spontaneously, especially if there is no distal obstruction.

Similarly, the left lobe artery may be augmented or replaced by a branch of the left gastric artery running in the lesser omentum from the lesser curve of the stomach.

In the small bowel, the cysts hatch and a large number of trophozoites are released and carried to the colon, where flask-shaped ulcers form in the submucosa. The trophozoites multiply, ultimately forming cysts, which either enter the portal circulation or are passed in the faeces as an infective form that infects other humans as a result of insanitary conditions. Having entered the portal circulation, the trophozoites are filtered and trapped in the interlobular veins of the liver. They multiply in the portal triads, causing focal infarction of hepatocytes and liquefactive necrosis as a result of proteolytic enzymes produced by the trophozoites. The areas of necrosis eventually coalesce to form the abscess cavity. The typical patient with an amoebic liver abscess is a young adult male with a history of insidious onset of non-specific symptoms, such as abdominal pain, anorexia, fever, night sweats, malaise, cough and weight loss. These symptoms gradually progress to more specific symptoms of pain in the right upper abdomen and right shoulder tip, hiccoughs and a non-productive cough. A past history of bloody diarrhoea or travel to an endemic area raises the index of suspicion. The abscess cavity contains chocolate colored, odorless, \u2018anchovy sauce\u2019-like fluid that is a mixture of necrotic liver tissue and blood. On ultrasonography, an abscess cavity in the liver is seen as a hypoechoic or anechoic lesion with ill-defined borders; internal echoes suggest necrotic material or debris. The investigation is very accurate and is used for aspiration, both diagnostic and therapeutic. When there is doubt about the diagnosis, a computed tomography (CT) scan may be helpful. Diagnostic aspiration is of limited value except for establishing the typical colour of the aspirate, which is sterile and odorless unless it is secondarily infected Medical treatment is very effective and should be the first choice in the elective situation, with surgery being reserved for complications.</li><li>\u27a4 The organism enters the gut through food or water contaminated with the cyst.

It is seen more frequently in the elderly and in women. Frequently an episode of acute cholecystitis leads to erosion of inflamed tissues, resulting in a cholecysto-intestinal fistula. A majority of small gallstones pass through the intestines spontaneously. However, gallstones of size 2\u20135 cm get impacted, usually in the terminal ileum or at the ileocecal valve owing to the relatively narrow lumen and less active peristalsis here. Less common locations include the stomach and the duodenum (Bouveret\u2019s syndrome). Impacted stones may lead to necrosis and perforation followed by peritonitis. Clinical manifestations include acute, intermittent or chronic episodes of partial or complete gastrointestinal obstruction. Physical examination may be non-specific or may show signs of obstruction: dehydration, abdominal distension and tenderness, with high-pitched bowel sounds, and obstructive jaundice. A plain abdominal radiograph shows: Partial or complete intestinal obstruction Pneumobilia or contrast material in the biliary tree An aberrant rim-calcified or total-calcified gallstone A change in the position of such a gallstone on serial films (\u2018tumbling sign\u2019).

Echinococcus granulosus , the causative agent of hydatid disease , has a life cycle that involves dogs (definitive host) and sheep (intermediate host). Humans become accidental intermediate hosts by ingesting ova through contaminated food, water, or direct contact with dog feces . Once ingested, the eggs hatch in the intestines, and the larvae can migrate through the portal vein (PV) to various organs, most commonly the liver, where they form hydatid cysts. This is considered a dead-end in the parasite's life cycle because humans are not a part of the natural transmission cycle.</li><li>\u2022 Option A: Man is the dead-end host, Option D: Echinococcus is causative.

It is more common in females. It is caused by extravasation of bile into the gallbladder wall from rupture of the Rokitansky\u2013Aschoff sinuses or by mucosal ulceration as a result of a focal or diffuse destructive inflammatory process, with accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages (xanthoma cells), fibrous tissue and acute and chronic inflammatory cells. USG shows gallbladder wall thickening (diffuse or focal, with intact mucosal lining), intramural hypoechoic nodules or bands and often the presence of gallstones. CT shows 5- to 20-mm intramural hypo attenuating nodules and poor/heterogeneous contrast enhancement. As with acute cholecystitis, early enhancement of the adjacent liver parenchyma may occur. Extension into the liver along with enlarged hepatoduodenal lymph nodes closely mimics gallbladder carcinoma. Diagnosis is difficult and depends on pathological examination. Intraoperatively, frozen-section examination should be carried out to differentiate xantho-granulomatous cholecystitis from carcinoma of the gallbladder (coexistence of gallbladder cancer 2.3\u201313.3%). Because of diagnostic difficulties if there is preoperative suspicion of xantho-granulomatous cholecystitis open cholecystectomy should be considered.</li><li>\u27a4 Xantho-granulomatous cholecystitis is an uncommon inflammation of the gallbladder, more frequently seen in India and Japan.

Percutaneous drainage to the exterior is not the treatment of choice due to high recurrence risk , and alternative drainage methods should be considered if intervention is required.</li><li>\u27a4 Pancreatic pseudocysts</li><li>\u27a4 episode of acute pancreatitis</li><li>\u27a4 contain high amylase and low CEA levels</li><li>\u27a4 Percutaneous drainage</li><li>\u27a4 exterior is not the treatment of choice</li><li>\u27a4 high recurrence risk</li><li>\u27a4 A pseudocyst is a collection of amylase-rich fluid enclosed in a well-defined wall of fibrous or granulation tissue. Pseudocysts typically arise following an attack of acute pancreatitis. Formation of a pseudocyst requires 4 weeks or more from the onset of acute pancreatitis. More than half have communication with the main pancreatic duct. Fluid from a pseudocyst typically has a low CEA level, and levels above 400 ng/ml are suggestive of a mucinous neoplasm. Pseudocyst fluid usually has a high amylase level. Pseudocysts usually resolve spontaneously, but complications can develop. Pseudocysts that are thick walled or large (>6 cm in diameter), have lasted for a long time (over 12 weeks) or have arisen in the context of chronic pancreatitis are less likely to resolve spontaneously. Therapeutic intervention is advised only if the pseudocyst causes symptoms, complications develop, or distinction has to be made between a pseudocyst and a tumor. There are three possible approaches to draining a pseudocyst: percutaneous, endoscopic and surgical. Percutaneous drainage to the exterior under radiological guidance should be avoided. It carries a very high likelihood of recurrence. Moreover, it is not advisable unless one is certain that the cyst is not neoplastic and that it has no communication with the pancreatic duct (or else a pancreatico-cutaneous fistula will develop). A percutaneous transgastric cyst o gastrostomy can be performed under imaging guidance, and a double-pigtail drain placed with one end in the cyst cavity and the other end in the gastric lumen. Endoscopic drainage usually involves puncture of the cyst through the stomach or duodenal wall under endoscopic ultrasound guidance, and placement of a tube drain with one end in the cyst cavity and the other end in the gastric lumen. Occasionally, ERCP and placement of a pancreatic stent across the ampulla may help to drain a pseudocyst that is in communication with the duct. Surgical drainage involves internally draining the cyst into the gastric or jejunal lumen. The approach is conventionally through an open incision, but laparoscopic cysto-gastrostomy is also feasible. Pseudocysts that have developed complications are best managed surgically.</li><li>\u27a4 A pseudocyst is a collection of amylase-rich fluid enclosed in a well-defined wall of fibrous or granulation tissue.
