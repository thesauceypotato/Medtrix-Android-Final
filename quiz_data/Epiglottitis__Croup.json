He was given no medications and had no known allergies, although his younger brother was recently diagnosed with a severe peanut allergy. Temperature is 39.4 C, blood pressure is 100/65 mm Hg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 46/min. His oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. The patient appears anxious, drooling with inspiratory stridor, and has a hot potato-muffled voice. He seems most comfortable when sitting upright with his neck extended.
