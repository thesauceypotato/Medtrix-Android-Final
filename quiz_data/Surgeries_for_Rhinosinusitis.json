A 2 cm long horizontal incision is made in the superomedial aspect of the orbit below the eyebrow . Floor of the frontal sinus is exposed and a hole drilled with a burr. Pus is taken for culture and sensitivity, and a plastic tube inserted and fixed. Sinus can now be irrigated with normal saline two or three times daily until the frontonasal duct becomes patent. This can be determined by adding a few drops of methylene blue to the irrigating fluid and its exit seen through the nose. Drainage tube is removed when the frontonasal duct becomes patent.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect Option:s:- Option: A. Antral lavage.
