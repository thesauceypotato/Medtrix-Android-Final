The miliary pattern gets its name from the resemblance of the granulomas to millet seeds. Miliary TB can occur when TB lung lesions erode pulmonary veins or when extrapulmonary TB lesions erode systemic veins. This results in hematogenous dissemination of tubercle bacilli producing myriads of 1\u20132 mm lesions throughout the body in susceptible hosts. Miliary spread limited to the lungs can occur following erosion of pulmonary arteries by TB lung lesions.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria Triad IV hemolysis Pancytopenia Increase risk of venous thrombosis Pathophysiology PNH occurs in patients who are unable to bind the regulatory proteins, DAF (CD55), HRF or MIRL (CD59) on their red cell surfaces. Spontaneous complement\u2013mediated lysis of erythrocytes occurs. Hemolysis in PNH is due to an intrinsic abnormality of the red cell which makes it exquisitely sensitive to activated complement whether it is activated through the alternative pathway or through an antigen-antibody reaction. The former mechanism is mainly responsible for intravascular hemolysis in PNH. The latter mechanism explains why the hemolysis can be dramatically exacerbated in the course of a viral or bacterial infection. Hypersusceptibility to complement is due to deficiency of several protective membrane proteins, of which CD59 is the most important because it hinders the insertion of C9 polymers into the membrane. The molecular basis for the deficiency of these proteins is due to the shortage of a unique glycolipid molecule, GPI, which, through a peptide bond, anchors these proteins to the surface membrane of cells. The shortage of GPI is due in turn to a mutation in an X-linked gene called PIG-A required for an early step in GPI biosynthesis. Two kinds of membrane proteins: Transmembrane and Glycosyl- phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked. The latter are anchored to cell membranes through a covalent attachment to a Glycosyl- phosphatidylinositol moiety. In PNH, GPI cannot be synthesized, leading to a global deficiency of GPI-linked membrane protein. Clinical Features of PNH Intravascular hemolysis Most of the clinical features of PNH can be attributed to intravascular hemolysis. The hemolysis is paroxysmal and usually occurs in the night. During sleep at night, we all tend to retain CO 2 leading to mild respiratory acidosis the pH of the blood gets slightly reduced, low pH leads to activation of the complement. Activation of the complement in turn causes intra-vascular hemolysis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia (Pancytopenia) . This is also the basis for Ham\u2019s acidified serum test which is used to diagnose PNH. When the blood is placed  in acidic medium, it undergoes hemolysis. Splenomegaly is not a feature. Thrombosis Platelets are decreased in PNH. But despite the presence of thrombocytopenia, PNH is associated with an increased incidence of thrombosis. Budd-Chiari syndrome is one of the common clinical manifestations of thrombosis, it occurs due to hepatic vein thrombosis. Ascites with acute hepatomegaly with pain in abdomen, without previous liver disease. Diagnosis of PNH Tests Ham\u2019s test is based upon susceptibility of RBC\u2019s to complement mediated lysis in patients with PNH. Sucrose lysin test. Flow cytometry is the gold standard in diagnosis. Analysis GPI-linked proteins CD59, DAF Bone Marrow in PNH Normoblastic hyperplasia is the characteristic finding in PNH (Pancytopenia with normoblastic hypercellular BM). At some stage of disease BM may become hypocellular or even aplastic (25% cases \u2013 aplastic). Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase in PNH is decreased. Other: Hb\u2193 MCV\u2191 Complications Aplastic anemia can occur AML can occur in (10%) cases Causes of Deaths Venous thrombosis (most common cause of death in PNH is cortical vein thrombosis) Infection Bleeding. Treatment FA, Blood transfusion, BMT. New Drug Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the complement protein C5, thus inhibiting terminal complement mediated intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients. It is also useful in rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory diseases, e.g. nephritis.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Cat-scratch disease Cat-scratch disease ( CSD ) is a common and usually benign infectious disease caused by the bacterium Bartonella- henselae. It is most commonly found in children following a scratch or bite from a cat within about 1 to 2 weeks. Signs and symptoms: It commonly presents as tender, swollen lymph nodes near the site of the inoculating bite or scratch or on the neck, and is usually limited to one side (regional lymphadenopathy) and occurs 1\u20133 weeks after inoculation. A vesicle or an erythematous papule may form at the site of initial infection. Most patients also develop systemic symptoms such as malaise, decreased appetite, and aches. Other associated complaints include headache, chills, muscular pains, joint pains, arthritis, backache, and abdominal pain. It may take 7 to 14 days, or as long as 2 months for symptoms to appear. Most cases are benign and self-limiting, but lymphadenopathy may persist for several months after other symptoms disappear. The disease usually resolves spontaneously with or with- out treatment in one month. In rare situations, CSD can lead to the development of serious neurologic or cardiac sequelae such as meningoencephalitis, encephalopathy, seizures, or endocarditis. Endocarditis associated with Bartonella infection has a particularly high mortality. Parinaud\u2019s oculoglandular syndrome is the most common ocular manifestation of CSD, and is a granulomatous conjunctivitis with concurrent swelling of the lymph node  near  the ear. Optic neuritis or neuroretinitis is one of the atypical presentations. Immunocompromised patients are susceptible to other conditions associated with B. henselae and B. quintana, such as bacillary angiomatosis or bacillary peliosis. Bacillary angiomatosis is primarily a vascular skin lesion that may extend to bone or be present in other areas of the body. Bacillary peliosis is caused by B. henselae that most often affects patients with HIV and other conditions causing severe immune compromise. Diagnosis: The Warthin\u2013Starry stain can be helpful to show the presence of B. henselae, but is often difficult to interpret.henselae is difficult to culture and can take 2\u20136 weeks to incubate. The best diagnostic method currently available is polymerase chain reaction which has a sensitivity of 43\u201376% and a specificity (in one study) of 100%. Histology High-magnification micrograph of CSD showing a granuloma and a microabscess with neutrophils (H and E stain). It   is   characterized   by   granulomatous   inflammation on histological examination of the lymph nodes. Under the microscope, the skin lesion demonstrates a circumscribed focus of necrosis, surround by histiocytes, often accompanied by multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes and eosinophils. The regional lymph nodes demonstrate follicular hyperplasia with central stellate necrosis with neutrophils, sur- rounded by palisading histiocytes (suppurative granulomas) and sinuses packed with monocytoid B cells, usually with- out perifollicular and intrafollicular epithelioid cells.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Lack of differentiation Malignant neoplasms that are composed of undifferentiated cells are said to be anaplastic. Lack of differentiation, or ana- plasia, is considered a hallmark of malignancy. The term anaplasia literally means \u2018backward formation\u2019\u2014 implying dedifferentiation, or loss of the structural and functional differentiation of normal cells. It is now known, however, that at least some cancers arise from stem cells in tissues; in these tumors, failure of differentiation rather than dedifferentiation of specialized cells accounts for their undifferentiated appearance. Recent studies also indicate that in some cases, dedifferentiation of apparently mature cells does occur during carcinogenesis. Anaplastic cells display marked pleomorphism (i.e. variation in size and shape). Often the nuclei are extremely hyperchromatic (dark-staining) and large resulting in an increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio that may approach 1:1 instead of the normal 1:4 or 1:6. Giant cells that are considerably larger than their neighbours may be formed and possess either one enormous nucleus or several nuclei. Anaplastic nuclei are variable and bizarre in size and shape. The chromatin is coarse and clumped, and nucleoli may be of astounding size. More important, mitoses often are numerous and distinctly atypical; anarchic multiple spindles may produce tripolar or quadripolar mitotic figures. Also anaplastic cells usually fail to develop recognizable patterns of orientation to one another (i.e. they lose normal polarity). They may grow in sheets with total loss of communal structures such as glands or stratified squamous architecture.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>In minutes Hyperacute rejection occurs within minutes to a few hours after transplantation in a Pre sensitized host and typically is recognized by the surgeon just after the vascular anastomosis is completed. In contrast with a nonrejecting  kidney  graft which regains a normal pink color and tissue turgor and promptly excretes urine, a hyper acutely rejecting kidney rapidly becomes cyanotic, mottled, and flaccid and may excrete only a few drops of bloody fluid. The histologic picture is characterized by widespread acute arteritis and  arteriolitis,  vessel thrombosis, and ischemic necrosis, all resulting from the binding of preformed antibodies to graft endothelium. Virtually all arterioles and arteries exhibit characteristic acute fibrinoid necrosis of their walls with narrowing or complete occlusion of the lumens by precipitated fibrin and cellular debris. Acute rejection may occur within days to weeks of transplantation in a non immunosuppressed host or may appear months or even years later, even in the presence of adequate immuno- suppression. It is caused by both cellular and humoral immune mechanisms, and in any one patient, one or the other may predominate, or both may be present. On histologic examination, cellular rejection is marked by an interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrate with associated edema and parenchymal injury, whereas humoral rejection is associated with vasculitis. Acute cellular rejection most commonly is seen within the first month after transplantation and typically is accompanied by clinical signs of renal failure. Histologic examination usually shows extensive interstitial CD4+ and CD8+     T cell infiltration with edema and mild interstitial hemorrhage. Glomerular and peritubular capillaries contain large numbers of mononuclear cells which also may invade the tubules leading to focal tubular necrosis. In addition to tubular injury, CD8+ T cells also may injure the endothelium causing an endothelitis. Cyclosporine (a widely used immuno suppressive agent) is also nephrotoxic and induces so called arteriolar hyaline deposits. Renal biopsy is used to distinguish rejection from drug toxicity. Accurate recognition of cellular rejection is important because patients typically respond promptly to increased immunosuppressive therapy. Acute humoral rejection (rejection vasculitis) caused by anti donor antibodies also may participate in acute graft rejection. The histologic lesions may take the form of necrotizing vasculitis with endothelial cell necrosis; neutrophilic infiltration; deposition of antibody, complement, and fibrin; and thrombosis. Such lesions may be associated with ischemic necrosis of the renal parenchyma. Somewhat older subacute lesions are characterized by marked thickening of the intima by proliferating fibroblasts, myocytes, and foamy macrophages. The resultant narrowing of the arterioles may cause infarction or renal cortical atrophy. The proliferative vascular lesions mimic arteriosclerotic thickening and are believed to be caused by cytokines that stimulate prolifera- tion of vascular smooth muscle cells. Local deposition of complement breakdown products (specifically C4d) is used to detect antibody-mediated rejection of kidney allografts. Chronic rejection: Patients present with chronic rejection late after transplantation (months to years) with a progressive rise in serum creatinine levels  (an  index  of  renal  function) over a period of 4 to 6  months.  Chronic  rejection  is  dominated by vascular changes, interstitial fibrosis, and loss of renal parenchyma; there are typically only mild or no ongoing cellular parenchymal infiltrates. The vascular changes occur pre- dominantly in the arteries and arterioles which exhibit intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix syn- thesis . These lesions ultimately compromise vascular perfusion and result in renal ischemia manifested by the loss or hyalinization of glomeruli, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. The vascular lesion may be caused by cytokines released by activated T cells that act on the cells of the vascular wall, and  it may be the end stage of the proliferative arteritis.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>C3b Opsonization involves the binding of an opsonin, e.g. antibody, to an epitope on an antigen. After opsonin binds to the membrane, phagocytes are attracted to the pathogen. The Fab portion of the antibody binds to the antigen, whereas the Fc portion of the antibody binds to an Fc receptor on the phagocyte, facilitating phagocytosis. The core receptor + opsonin complex also creates by-products like C3b and C4b which are important components for the efficient function of the complement system. These components are deposited on the cell surface of the pathogen and aid in its destruction. The cell can also be destroyed by a process called antiphagocytic cell-mediated cytotoxicity in which the pathogen does not need to be phagocytosed to be destroyed. During this process, the pathogen is opsonized and bound with the antibody IgG via its Fab domain. This allows the antibody binding of an immune effector cell via its Fc domain. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated inherent mediation then triggers a release of lysis products from the bound immune effector cell (monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and NK cells). Lack of mediation can cause inflammation of surrounding tis- sues and damage to healthy cells.</p>\n<p></p>",

Acute cellular rejection: T cells destroy graft parenchyma (and vessels) by cytotoxicity and inflammatory reactions. Acute humoral rejection: Antibodies damage graft vasculature.

The mutation alters an amino acid residue in factor V and renders it resistant to protein C. Thus, an important antithrombotic counter-regulatory mechanism is lost. Heterozygotes carry a 5-fold increased risk for venous thrombosis, while homozygotes having a 50-fold increased risk. A single-nucleotide substitution (G to A) in the 3\u2032-untranslated region of the prothrombin gene is a fairly common allele (found in 1 to 2% of the general population). This variant results in increased prothrombin transcription and is associated with a nearly three-fold increased risk for venous thromboses. Less common primary hypercoagulable states include inherited deficiencies of anticoagulants such as antithrombin III, protein C, or protein S; affected patients typically present with venous thrombosis and recurrent thromboembolism in adolescence or early adult life. Congenitally elevated levels of homocysteine contribute to arterial and venous thromboses (and indeed to the development of atherosclerosis).</p>\n<p></p>",

Both cavernous and capillary hemangiomas may be encountered, although the latter often are more cellular than in adults and thus may be deceptively worrisome-appearing. In children, most hemangiomas are located in the skin, particularly on the face and scalp where they produce flat to elevated, irregular, red-blue masses; the flat, larger lesions are referred to as port wine stains. They may enlarge as the child gets older, but in many instances they spontaneously regress. The vast majority of superficial hemangiomas have no more than a cosmetic significance; rarely, they may be the manifestation of a hereditary disorder associated with disease within internal organs, such as the von Hippel-Lindau and Sturge-Weber syndromes. A subset of CNS cavernous hemangiomas can occur in the familial setting; affected families harbor mutations in one of three cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) genes.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Gamma interferon assay Tuberculosis: It is the classic granulomatous infection. The disease is divided into primary and secondary (or reactivation) tuberculosis. Primary tuberculosis: The disease is acquired from the initial exposure to M. tuberculosis, most commonly as a result of inhaling infected aerosols generated when a person with cavitary tuberculosis coughs. Pathology The Ghon complex is the first lesion of primary tuberculosis and consists of a peripheral parenchymal granuloma, often in the upper lobes. When it is associated with an enlarged mediastinal lymph node a Ranke complex is formed. Microscopically, a granuloma with central caseous necrosis shows varying degrees of fibrosis. Apical scarring with the appearance of a fibronodular patch or ill-defined reticular shadow in the upper lung fields on chest X-ray is known as \u2018 Simon\u2019s focus\u2019 . Purl\u2019s lesion: Lesion at the apex of lung in chronic cases. Assmann\u2019s focus : Typically, apical (site of highest oxygen tension) TB Simon\u2019s focus: Early hematogenous seedling in apex of lungs. Ghon\u2019s complex: Parenchymal subpleural lesion + draining lymphatics + enlarged caseous lymph  nodes in primary tuberculosis Ranke complex: Healed lesions in lung parenchyma and hilar lymph nodes undergoing calcification due to TB Rich focus: Tuberculous caseous foci in brain, meninges and spinal cord. Secondary tuberculosis: This stage represents either reactivation of primary pulmonary tuberculosis or a new infection in a host previously sensitized by primary tuberculosis. Pathology A cellular immune response occurs after a latent interval and leads to formation of many granulomas and extensive tissue necrosis. The apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes are most commonly involved. A diffuse, fibrotic, poorly defined lesion develops. Some erode into a bronchus creates a tuberculous cavity. Tuberculous cavities range in size from under 1 cm in diameter to large cystic areas. The tuberculous cavity often communicates freely with a bronchus, and spreads the infection within the lung. Secondary tuberculosis is associated with a number of complications: Miliary tuberculosis refers to the presence of multiple, small (size of millet seeds), tuberculous granulomas in many organs. Hemoptysis Bronchopleural fistula occurs when a subpleural cavity ruptures into the pleural space. In turn, tuberculous empyema and pneumothorax result. Tuberculous laryngitis Intestinal tuberculosis. Testing for Latent Tuberculosis Infection The goal of testing for LTBI is to identify individuals who are at increased risk for the development of active TB; these individuals would benefit most from treatment of LTBI (also termed preventive therapy or prophylaxis). Thus, only those who would benefit from treatment should be tested; a decision to test should presuppose a decision to treat if the test is positive. In general, testing for LTBI is indicated when the risk of development of disease from latent infection (if present) is increased; examples include likely recent infection (e.g. close contact of a person with TB) or a decreased capacity to contain latent infection (e.g. because of immunosuppression, as in the case of young children in contact with those with active TB, people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or otherwise immunosuppressed persons because of medications or conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes). In contrast, screening for LTBI in persons or groups who are healthy and have a low risk of progressing to active disease is not appropriate, since the positive predictive value of LTBI testing is low and the risks of treatment can outweigh the potential benefits. The balance of risk and benefit is also different in high-burden settings, where the risk of reinfection may be high and screening for LTBI will have a low negative predictive value. For children, the risk-to-benefit ratio is more favorable than for adults. There is no diagnostic gold standard for LTBI, and all existing tests are indirect approaches which provide immunological evidence of host sensitization to TB antigens. There are two accepted but imperfect tests for identification of LTBI: The tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) release assay (IGRA). Both tests depend on cell-mediated immunity (memory T-cell response) and neither test can accurately distinguish between LTBI and active TB disease. IGRA: Assay principles IGRAs are in vitro blood tests of cell-mediated immune response; they measure T-cell release of IFN-\u03b3 following stimulation by antigens specific to the M. tuberculosis complex (with the exception of BCG sub strains), i.e. early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP- 10). These antigens are encoded by genes  located  within  the region of difference 1 (RD1) locus of the M. tuberculosis genome. They are more specific than PPD for M. tuberculosis because they are not encoded in the genomes of any BCG vaccine strains or most species of NTM, other than M. marinum, M. kansasii, M. szulgai, and M. flavescens. However, not all NTMs have been studied for cross-reactivity. There is some evidence of cross-reactivity between ESAT-6 and CFP-10 of M.tuberculosis and M. leprae, but the clinical significance of this in settings where leprosy and TB are endemic (e.g. India and Brazil) is poorly characterized. Two commercial  IGRA  are  available  in  many   countries: the QuantiFERON-TB Gold in tube (QFT) assay (Cellestis/ Qiagen, Carnegie, Australia) and the T-SPOT.TB assay (Oxford Immunotec, Abingdon, UK). Both tests are approved by the US food and drug administration (FDA) and Health Canada and are Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (CE) marked for use in Europe. The QFT assay is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based, whole-blood test that uses peptides from the RD1 antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10 as well as peptides from one additional antigen (TB7.7 [Rv2654c] which is not an RD1 anti- gen) in an in-tube format. The result is reported as quantification of IFN-\u03b3 in international units (IU) per milliliter. An individual is considered positive for M. tuberculosis infection if the IFN-\u03b3 response to TB antigens is above the test cutoff (after subtract- ing the background IFN-\u03b3 response of the negative control). The T-SPOT. TB assay is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay performed on separated and counted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that are incubated with ESAT-6 and CFP-10 peptides. The result is reported as the number of IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells (spot-forming cells). An individual is considered positive for M. tuberculosis infection if the spot counts in the TB antigen wells exceed a specific threshold relative to the negative control wells. Indeterminate IGRA results can occur due to a low IFN-\u03b3 response to the positive (mitogen) control or a high background response to the negative control.</p>\n<p></p>",
