Lumbar epidural analgesia offers a safe and effective method of pain relief during labor and is the mainstay of labor anal\u00adgesia.

The alkalinization of urine with bicarbonate enhances the renal excretion of phenobarbital. Other barbiturates are excreted unchanged by the kidney only in trivial amounts.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. It is lipid soluble. Because of its lipophilicity , relatively large volume of dis\u00adtribution, and low rate of hepatic clearance, thiopental can accumulate in tissues, especially if given in large doses over a prolonged period. Option: B. It achieves maximum concentration in the brain after an IV infusion. Drugs with high lipid solubility and a low degree of ioniza\u00adtion cross the blood-brain barrier rapidly, producing a fast onset of action. Approximately 50% of thiopental is nonionized at physiologic pH, which accounts partly for the rapid accumulation of thiopental in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after IV administration. Option: C. Adipose tissue uptake and metabolic clearance (elimination) play only a minor role in the termination of the effects of the induction dose. This is a result of the minimal perfusion ratio of adipose tissue compared with other tissues and the slow rate of removal.</p>\n<p></p>",
