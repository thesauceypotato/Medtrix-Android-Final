Classical Mixed cellularity Nodular sclerosis Lymphocyte rich Lymphocyte depleted Nodular Lymphocyte predominant Important points about Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma: Mixed Cellularity: Most common Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma in India. Associated with HIV and EBV. Males > Females. Constitutive or B symptoms are more common. Microscopy: Mononuclear variants of RS cells. Nodular Sclerosis: Most common Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma in the world. 2nd best prognosis. Not associated with EBV. Females > Males. Microscopy: Lacunar variants and collagen bands were seen. Lymphocyte Rich: Seen in older males. Lymphocyte Depleted: Maximum EBV association. Worst prognosis. Microscopy: Pleomorphic RS cells and Mummified RS cells. Nodular Lymphocyte Predominant: Best prognosis. No EBV association. Microscopy: Popcorn RS cells.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. T cell.
