Congenital curvatures are due to anomalous development of the vertebrae (failure of formation and/or segmentation). In most cases, congenital scolioses are non-hereditary. It is believed to be related to an insult to the fetus during spine embryological development (between the 5 th -8 th week of gestation). 25% of curves are non-progressive, 25% mildly progressive and 50% highly progressive and will require treatment. The mainstay of treatment is either observation or surgery. The rigidity of the curve is assessed, and the rib hump measured. Associated malformations must be looked for clinically: look for foot or leg asymmetry, craniofacial malformation, a Klippel-Feil web neck, and cardiac and urinary malformations. Full-body-width Postero-anterior (PA) and lateral X-rays are essential. After 1 year of age, X-rays should be taken standing, with the legs in extension and the pelvis level, to compensate for any leg length discrepancy. The Cobb angle will be measured. CT scans shows a bony bar. Congenital scoliosis can be classified into defect of formation or defect of segmentation: Fully segmented hemivertebra (two growth plates) with a contralateral bar Unilateral unsegmented bar Two consecutives fully segmented hemivertebrae Fully segmented hemivertebra Semi segmented hemivertebra Wedge vertebra (partial failure of formation) Incarcerated hemivertebra (smaller and induce little deformity as the hemivertebra sits in a non-growing block; the alignment of the pedicles usually remains straight)</li><li>\u2022 Congenital scoliosis is the most frequent congenital deformity of the spine.</li><li>\u2022 Congenital curvatures are due to anomalous development of the vertebrae (failure of formation and/or segmentation).</li><li>\u2022 In most cases, congenital scolioses are non-hereditary.</li><li>\u2022 It is believed to be related to an insult to the fetus during spine embryological development (between the 5 th -8 th week of gestation).</li><li>\u2022 25% of curves are non-progressive, 25% mildly progressive and 50% highly progressive and will require treatment.</li><li>\u2022 The mainstay of treatment is either observation or surgery.</li><li>\u2022 The rigidity of the curve is assessed, and the rib hump measured.</li><li>\u2022 Associated malformations must be looked for clinically: look for foot or leg asymmetry, craniofacial malformation, a Klippel-Feil web neck, and cardiac and urinary malformations.</li><li>\u2022 Full-body-width Postero-anterior (PA) and lateral X-rays are essential.</li><li>\u2022 After 1 year of age, X-rays should be taken standing, with the legs in extension and the pelvis level, to compensate for any leg length discrepancy.</li><li>\u2022 The Cobb angle will be measured.</li><li>\u2022 CT scans shows a bony bar.</li><li>\u2022 Congenital scoliosis can be classified into defect of formation or defect of segmentation: Fully segmented hemivertebra (two growth plates) with a contralateral bar Unilateral unsegmented bar Two consecutives fully segmented hemivertebrae Fully segmented hemivertebra Semi segmented hemivertebra Wedge vertebra (partial failure of formation) Incarcerated hemivertebra (smaller and induce little deformity as the hemivertebra sits in a non-growing block; the alignment of the pedicles usually remains straight)</li><li>\u2022 Fully segmented hemivertebra (two growth plates) with a contralateral bar Unilateral unsegmented bar Two consecutives fully segmented hemivertebrae Fully segmented hemivertebra Semi segmented hemivertebra Wedge vertebra (partial failure of formation) Incarcerated hemivertebra (smaller and induce little deformity as the hemivertebra sits in a non-growing block; the alignment of the pedicles usually remains straight)</li><li>\u2022 Fully segmented hemivertebra (two growth plates) with a contralateral bar</li><li>\u2022 Unilateral unsegmented bar</li><li>\u2022 Two consecutives fully segmented hemivertebrae</li><li>\u2022 Fully segmented hemivertebra</li><li>\u2022 Semi segmented hemivertebra</li><li>\u2022 Wedge vertebra (partial failure of formation)</li><li>\u2022 Incarcerated hemivertebra (smaller and induce little deformity as the hemivertebra sits in a non-growing block; the alignment of the pedicles usually remains straight)</li><li>\u2022 Treatment: Treatment consists of either observation of the curve or surgery, or, rarely, bracing. Observation should be applied only for non-progressive curves with a balanced spine. Bracing is inefficient in congenital scoliosis. It may be indicated for long flexible curves or to control the compensatory lumbar curve or help rebalancing the spine, or it may be used after an operation, for instance, until the fusion is solid. Surgery is the mainstay of care. Prophylactic surgery: surgery that will prevent further worsening or allow progressive correction over time. These operations are in situ fusion and hemi epiphysiodesis. In situ fusion can be done with a single posterior fusion, with or without instrumentation or with an anterior fusion, or a 360\u00b0 fusion.</li><li>\u2022 Treatment: Treatment consists of either observation of the curve or surgery, or, rarely, bracing.

There is a genetic component, but the etiology is multifactorial. It is grouped by age. In children age 3 and younger, it is called infantile scoliosis. In age 4-10, it is called juvenile scoliosis. In age >10, it is called adolescent scoliosis. Structural curve becomes more prominent on forward bending (Adams test) as opposed to postural scoliosis. Compensatory curve due to limb length discrepancy or sciatic list (due to disc prolapsed) disappear on sitting.  Postural scoliosis disappears on forward bending.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

It may present at any age; and in many cases progresses relentlessly, particularly in patients with more severe neurologic and systemic involvement. Progressive deformity may limit mobility and seating status, and may be associated with primary or secondary effects on cardiopulmonary function over time.

A) Neurocysticercosis</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The MRI brain image shows multiple cyst-like lesions within the brain, which are characteristic of neurocysticercosis, often described as a \"starry sky\" appearance. Neurocysticercosis is an infection caused by the larvae of the pork tapeworm, Taenia solium. These lesions are typically cystic with a scolex (head of the larva) visible within the cysts, which is a diagnostic feature. This condition is common in areas where pork is commonly consumed and sanitation practices are poor, and it can lead to serious neurological symptoms like the ones presented by the patient.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Tuberculoma: Generally appears as well-defined, enhancing masses on MRI, which are not specifically indicated by the cystic nature of the lesions seen in this image.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Tuberculoma:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Toxoplasmosis: Common in HIV patients, but typically presents as multiple ring-enhancing lesions rather than the cystic lesions with a clear scolex seen here.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Toxoplasmosis:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Cryptococcomas: Typically appear as gelatinous masses in the brain and would not usually present with the clear, cystic appearance with scoleces indicative of parasitic infection.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Cryptococcomas:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Neurocysticercosis should be considered in patients presenting with multiple cystic brain lesions, especially in contexts of headache and altered mental status, where the history and radiological findings suggest the presence of cysts with scoleces typical of tapeworm larvae.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
