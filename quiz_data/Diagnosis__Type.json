      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Paranoid The paranoid type of schizophrenia is characterized by preoccupation with one or more delusions (presence of delusions of persecution or grandeur) or frequent auditory hallucinations .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option B: Catatonic Type . The classic feature of the catatonic type is a marked disturbance in motor function ; this disturbance may involve stupor, negativism, rigidity, excitement, or posturing . Sometimes the patient shows a rapid alteration between extremes of excitement and stupor. Associated features include stereotypies, mannerisms, and waxy flexibility . Mutism is particularly common. Option: C. Undifferentiated Type . Frequently, patients who clearly have schizophrenia cannot easily fit into one type or another . These patients are classified as having schizophrenia of the undifferentiated type. Option: D. Residual Type . The residual type of schizophrenia is characterized by continuing evidence of the schizophrenic disturbance in the absence of a complete set of active symptoms or of sufficient symptoms to meet the diagnosis of another type of schizophrenia. Emotional blunting, social withdrawal, eccentric behavior, illogical thinking, and mild loosening of associations commonly appear in the residual type. When delusions or hallucinations occur, they are neither prominent nor accompanied by strong effect.</p>\n<p></p>",
