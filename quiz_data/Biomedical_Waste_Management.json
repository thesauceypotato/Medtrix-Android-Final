      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Safe collection and reuse Although mercury is classified under chemical waste, it is also grouped under toxic, hazardous waste. Hence, its disposal differs from discharge into drains or burial in a secured landfill. Discharge into drains leads to accumulation in the drains of water treatment plants, causing water pollution and very high levels of treated water. Deep burial also leads to environmental pollution. Items containing mercury should never be sent to an incinerator as it causes the release of mercury vapors in the environment, which is toxic. Hence, special norms have been laid down for the disposal of merc,ury which may arise due to the breakage of a thermometer, sphygmomanometer, mercury tube lights, or mercury-containing materials like tooth amalgam generated at dental clinics or thiomersal-containing vaccines.. The best practice suggested for the disposal of mercury is its proper collection using specialized devices containing copper brush with which it forms amalgam, safe storage, and reuse\u2014</p>\n<p></p>",
