      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>DTPA renogram Renal scans provide both functional and anatomic information. preferred modality in infants and children because of reduced radiation exposure compared with CT Renal scans using the radioisotope technetium Tc-99m mertiatide (Tc-99mMAG3) assess renal excretory function. It is the study of choice in differentiating between obstructive and nonobstructive hydronephrosis in infants and children and can also identify a difference in function between the two kidneys Imaging studies- Radionuclide Studies-- Radionuclide studies can measure renal function. Technetium diethylene triamine Penta acetic acid (99mTc \u2013 DTPA) (dynamic renal scan) is freely filtered by the glomerulus and not reabsorbed and is used to estimate GFR. Technetium is dimercaptosuccinic ( 99mTc \u2013 DMSA ) (State renal scan) is bound to the tubules and provides an assessment of functional renal mass . Example the DMSA SCAN OF a 31-month-old girl with recurrent UTI. The right kidney has a normal size with a cortical defect in the lower pole. The left kidney is small-sized with cortical loss in the lower part which can be due to cortical scar or duplicated collecting system. Radioiodinated (131I) ortho iodohippurate is secreted into the renal tubules and assesses renal plasma flow (RPF). Ultrasonography Kidney size can be determined; a kidney less than 9 cm in length indicates significant irreversible renal disease. b. A difference in the size of more than 1.5 cm between the two kidneys is observed in unilateral renal disease. Intravenous Urography (IVP) Rapid sequence IVP is done for Renal artery stenosis CT urography: Urography uses imaging and contrast material to evaluate or detect blood in urine kidney or bladder stones, and cancer in the urinary tract. Urography is often performed using X-ray (IVP), CT, or MRI. Cystoscopy: It is an endoscopy of the urinary bladder via the urethra carried ant with a cystoscope. It can be a flexible or rigid cystoscope.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All of the above Acute GN Acute Poststreptococcal GN Postinfectious glomerulonephritis occurs as a sequela of disease caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and helminths. It is the most common cause of GN in childhood. Nephritis develops 1 \u20133 weeks after pharyngeal (more common in winter) or cutaneous infection with (more common in summer ) \u2018nephritogenic\u2019 strains of group A beta\u2013hemolytic streptococci. Diagnosis depends on a positive pharyngeal or skin culture, rising antibody titers, and hypocomplementemia. Renal biopsy reveals diffuse proliferative GN. Pathology. Diffuse proliferative disease with mesangial and endothelial hypercellularity. Electron microscopy-dense deposits are seen in the subepithelial area (humps), sub-endothelial area, mesangial, and sometimes intra-membranous. Clinical features and diagnosis The typical clinical presentation is a sudden onset of hematuria and edema. The characteristic, but not diagnostic, laboratory profile is azotemia, hypocomplementemia, hematuria, leukocyturia, and proteinuria. Supporting data include elevated titers of antistreptolysin 0, anti-hyaluronidase, and anti-deoxyribonuclease B antibodies, all of which suggest preceding streptococcal infection. Clinical course and diagnosis The typical course of acute disease is recovery, particularly among children. Acute nephritis resolves with amelioration of edema and hypertension 1-3 weeks after onset. Proteinuria may persist for several months, exacerbated by erect posture and exercise. Microscopic hematuria similarly disappears slowly over a period of several months. CKD is rare in childhood PSGN but may be seen in adult-onset PSGN. Investigations Best Initial Test: Urine analysis. Most accurate test: Biopsy (but usually not needed) Indications of Biopsy H/O prior hematuria (as usually, PSGN doesn\u2019t recur, recurrent hematuria should point to a different diagnosis) No improvement within 2 weeks The complement level is decreased ( C3, CH50). Persistently low complement level beyond 6 weeks. Therapy. Hypertension must be treated aggressively, Furosemide or bumetanide is required for the underlying edema-inducing disease. Antibiotic - penicillin. Prophylaxis following post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is not indicated because recurrences are exceedingly rare. Immunosuppressive agents or corticosteroids have no therapeutic role.</p>\n<p></p>",

When they present with lung hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis, they have a pulmonary-renal syndrome called Goodpasture's syndrome. The target epitopes for this autoimmune disease lie in the quaternary structure of the a3 NC1 domain of collagen IV. The epitopes are normally sequestered in the collagen IV hexamer and can be exposed to infection, smoking, oxidants, or solvents. Goodpasture's syndrome appears in two age groups: in young men in their late twenties and in men and women in their sixties and seventies. Younger patients are more likely to present with the full Goodpasture's syndrome, with hemoptysis, a sudden fall in hemoglobin, fever, dyspnea, and hematuria, and older patients are more likely to present with isolated glomerulonephritis. Hemoptysis is largely confined to smokers, and those who present with lung hemorrhage as a group do better than older populations who have prolonged, asymptomatic renal injury.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. - Alports syndrome presents with sensorineural deafness, anterior lenticonus, and glomerulonephritis with characteristic basketweave appearance.
