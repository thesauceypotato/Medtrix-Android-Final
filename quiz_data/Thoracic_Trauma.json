      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All of the above</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Flail Chest : This condition usually results from blunt trauma associated with multiple rib fractures and is defined as three or more ribs fractured in two or more places. The blunt force typically also produces an underlying pulmonary contusion. Diagnosis : The diagnosis is made clinically in patients who are not ventilated, not by radiography. To confirm the diagnosis the chest wall can be observed for the paradoxical motion of a chest wall segment. On inspiration, the loose segment of the chest wall is displaced inwards and therefore less air moves into the lungs. On expiration, the segment moves outwards (paradoxical respiration). Voluntary splinting of the chest wall occurs as a result of pain, so mechanically impaired chest wall movement and the associated lung contusion all contribute to the hypoxia. There is a high risk of developing a pneumothorax or haemothorax. The CT scan remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of this condition. Traditionally, mechanical ventilation was used to \u2018internally splint\u2019 the chest but had a price in terms of intensive care unit (ICU) resources and ventilation-dependent morbidity. Treatment : Oxygen administration, adequate analgesia (including opiates) and physiotherapy. If a chest tube is in place, topical intrapleural local analgesia introduced via the tube can also be used. Ventilation is reserved for patients developing respiratory failure despite adequate analgesia and oxygen. Surgery to stabilize the flail segment using internal fixation of the ribs may be useful in a selected group of patients with an isolated or severe chest injury and pulmonary contusion</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Clinical indicators of potential ongoing bleeding in torso trauma. table,tr,th,td {border:1px solid black;} Physiological Increasing respiratory rate Increasing pulse rate Falling blood pressure Rising serum lactate Anatomical Visible bleeding Injury in close proximity to major vessels Penetrating injury with a retained missile</p>\n<p></p>",

The mediastinum is displaced to the opposite side, decreasing venous return and compressing the opposite lung.

Clinical Presentation : Increasingly restless with tachypnoea, dyspnoea and distended neck veins (similar to pericardial tamponade) Clinical Examination : Tracheal Deviation Hyper-Resonance Decreased or absent breath sounds over hemithorax Management: Treatment should never be delayed for radiological investigation.
