The transmission rate of hepatitis B from mother to newborn is very high , and almost all infected infants will develop chronic hepatitis B. Transmission can be significantly reduced through immunoprophylaxis. This risk is as high as 90% if the mother is also favorable for HBeAg. Symptoms usually begin six weeks to 6 months after exposure to the virus. Hepatitis has an age-dependent prognosis. Children are less likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become infected as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. Window period = Disappearance of HBs antigen & appearance of HBs Ab The first marker to be detected in an infected patient is HBsAg.</p>\n<p></p>",
