The test measures four serum analytes:</li><li>\u2022 Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) Unconjugated estriol (uE3) Free Beta-hCG Inhibin-A</li><li>\u2022 Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP)</li><li>\u2022 Unconjugated estriol (uE3)</li><li>\u2022 Free Beta-hCG</li><li>\u2022 Inhibin-A</li><li>\u2022 This test helps assess the risk of certain chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and trisomy 18, as well as neural tube defects. The quad screen has a lower sensitivity compared to the first trimester combined screening (which includes nuchal translucency and dual marker screening), making it particularly useful for women who present for prenatal care later in pregnancy.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 9-11 weeks : This timeframe is generally used for first trimester screening tests, such as the combined screening, which includes nuchal translucency and the dual marker test (free \u03b2-hCG and PAPP-A).</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 9-11 weeks</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 12-14 weeks : This period is also used for the combined first trimester screening but is not appropriate for the quad screen.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 12-14 weeks</li><li>\u2022 Option D. 22-28 weeks : This period is outside the recommended timeframe for the quad screen.

Menorrhagia refers to heavy menstrual bleeding that occurs in a regular cycle. In adolescents, anovulation, which is the failure of the ovary to release an oocyte during a menstrual cycle, frequently leads to heavy or prolonged bleeding due to the lack of a normal hormonal cycle that regulates the endometrial lining. Without the usual cyclical hormonal fluctuations, the endometrial lining may become excessively thick, leading to heavy bleeding when it sheds. This condition is typical in puberty due to the body's ongoing adjustment to hormonal regulation.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Endometriosis : Endometriosis involves the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which can cause painful menstruation and potentially contribute to menorrhagia. However, it is less common than anovulation as the primary cause of menorrhagia in adolescents.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Endometriosis</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Malignancy : Malignancy is a rare cause of menorrhagia in puberty. While malignancy can lead to abnormal bleeding, it is not the most common cause in this age group.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Malignancy</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. A) Round ligament</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The round ligament is responsible for maintaining the anteversion of the uterus, particularly during pregnancy. It consists of smooth muscle extensions of the uterine corpus and is the homologue of the gubernaculum testis. These ligaments arise from the lateral aspect of the corpus just below and anterior to the origin of the fallopian tubes, extend laterally to the pelvic sidewall, and enter the retroperitoneal space. They pass lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels before entering the inguinal canal through the internal inguinal ring and terminate in the subcutaneous tissue of the labia majora. During pregnancy, the round ligaments stretch to accommodate the enlarging uterus, helping to maintain its anteverted position.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Cardinal ligament : Also known as the transverse cervical ligament or Mackenrodt ligaments, these provide significant support to the uterus and cervix by attaching the lateral aspect of the uterus and cervix to the pelvic walls. However, they do not maintain anteversion.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Cardinal ligament</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Uterosacral ligament : These ligaments insert broadly into the posterior pelvic walls and sacrum and form the lateral boundaries of the cul-de-sac (Pouch of Douglas). They play a role in supporting the uterus but do not contribute to maintaining anteversion.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Uterosacral ligament</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Pubocervical ligament : This ligament forms part of the supportive structure for the uterus and vagina, attaching them to the pubic bone. It provides anterior support but does not maintain the anteversion of the uterus.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Pubocervical ligament</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The round ligament is primarily responsible for maintaining the anteversion of the uterus, especially during pregnancy.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. A) At eight weeks the embryo is bipotent</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 At eight weeks of gestation, the embryo is no longer bipotent. The term \"bipotent\" refers to the embryo's capability to develop into either male or female structures, which is true up until about the sixth week of development. By the eighth week, sexual differentiation is already underway, with the influence of the SRY gene causing the gonads to differentiate into testes in 46XY embryos. This differentiation results in a shift away from bipotency, making the embryo committed to developing male characteristics.</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Wolffian duct develops into epididymis and vas deferens on either side of the body : This statement is true. The Wolffian ducts, under the influence of testosterone, develop into the male reproductive structures including the epididymis and vas deferens.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Wolffian duct develops into epididymis and vas deferens on either side of the body</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Mullerian inhibiting substance inhibits Mullerian duct : This statement is true. Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS), also known as anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), is produced by Sertoli cells in the testes and inhibits the development of the Mullerian ducts, which would otherwise develop into female reproductive structures such as the uterine tubes and uterus.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Mullerian inhibiting substance inhibits Mullerian duct</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Dihydrotestosterone leads to the development of secondary sexual characters and external genitalia : This statement is true. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent metabolite of testosterone, is crucial for the development of male external genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics such as facial hair and a deeper voice.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Dihydrotestosterone leads to the development of secondary sexual characters and external genitalia</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 At eight weeks of gestation, the embryo is no longer bipotent; sexual differentiation has already commenced.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

It affects young women of childbearing age. The renal involvement of the disease can manifest in the form of active lupus nephritis or flare-ups during pregnancy. It can lead to preterm births, preeclampsia, and pregnancy loss while the infant can suffer from neonatal lupus and heart block. Management includes Preconceptionally counseling: Conception during a period of quiescence for at least 6 months determines a successful outcome. Stable remission of renal disease for at least 6 months before conception is recommended. Corticosteroids are useful during episodes of lupus flare and can be used safely in pregnancy. Immunosuppressants such as azathioprine can be continued during pregnancy. It may be used in case of severe SLE Hydroxychloroquine is found to be the best for maintenance and is safe in pregnancy. It can prevent the need for prolonged corticosteroid therapy. Methotrexate and cyclophosphamide are teratogenic and hence they are not safe during pregnancy.</li><li>\u2022 SLE is a chronic autoimmune disorder involving the multisystem.

Treatment is based on prognostication and staging. According to the given scoring system, the parameters such as the time interval since the antecedent pregnancy, beta-hCG levels, and the presence of lung metastases suggest a low-risk choriocarcinoma. For low-risk choriocarcinoma, the recommended treatment is multi-dose single-agent chemotherapy with methotrexate. Methotrexate is administered in a multi-dose regimen (Day 1, 3, 5, 7) alternating with folinic acid (Day 2, 4, 6, 8).</li><li>\u2022 Methotrexate with folinic acid:</li><li>\u2022 < 6: LOW RISK > 7 HIGH RISK</li><li>\u2022 < 6: LOW RISK</li><li>\u2022 > 7 HIGH RISK</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

EMACO regimen: The EMACO regimen, which includes etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine, is used for high-risk choriocarcinoma.
