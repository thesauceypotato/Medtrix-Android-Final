Ectopic bruising/ Percolated /Migratory contusion:- Blood will track along the fascial planes (or between muscle layers) which form the least resistance and may appear where the tissue layers become superficial. Hemorrhages in the soft tissues around the eyes and the eyelids (spectacle hematoma; black eye), may be caused by Direct trauma, such as a punch in the eye Blunt impact to the forehead, the blood gravitating downwards over the supraorbital bridge Fracture of the floor of the anterior fossa of the skull.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Comminuted fracture In a comminuted fracture, there are two or more intersecting lines of fracture that divide the bone into three or more fragments. They are caused by a significant force striking over a broad area, such as crushing head injuries, vehicle accidents, falls from a height on a hard surface, and from repeated blows by weapons with a large striking surface, e.g., heavy iron bar or poker, an axe, thick stick, etc. They may also result from a kick by an animal or by a bullet. It is often a complication of fissured or depressed fracture. When there is no displacement of the fragment, it resembles a spider's web or mosaic. Fissured fractures may radiate for varying distances from the area of comminution (fragmentation). When the force is great, the broken pieces of bone are displaced and some may enter the brain and others may be lost</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Mandible is definitely fractured The above statement is incorrect as  the mandible is not always fractured in such cases. Ring or Foramen Fractures: (Option A and D): It is fissured fracture which encircles the skull in such a manner that the anterior third is separated at its junction with the middle and posterior third. But usually, the term is applied to a fracture, which runs at about 3 to 5 outside the foramen magnum at the back and sides of the skull and passes forwards through the middle ears and roof of the nose, due to which the skull is separated from the spine. They are rare and occur after falls from a height onto the feet or buttocks. In very severe cases, the spine may be driven into the skull cavity, and the vault of the skull may burst open (explosive type), giving the impression of an original massive fracture. (Option B) A severe blow to the vertex may also cause a ring fracture, but in this case, the fracture of the vault will be depressed. A forceful blow on the chin in a traffic accident may produce a ring fracture. There may be a laceration of skin, but the mandible is not fractured in most cases. They are thought to be produced from forces transmitted into the back of the skull through the mandibular joints. They are also caused by a sudden violent turn of the head on the spine, shearing the vault from the base.</p>\n<p></p>",
