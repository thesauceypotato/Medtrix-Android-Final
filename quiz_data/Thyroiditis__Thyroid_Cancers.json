      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Grave\u2019s disease Grave\u2019s disease is the most common cause of endogenous hyperthyroidism .

Features: Diffuse goitre Hyperthyroidism signs and symptoms: weight loss, heat intolerance, tremors, palpitations, and anxiety Ophthalmopathy ( Graves' ophthalmopathy ) with symptoms such as proptosis, diplopia, and eye irritation Dermopathy ( Graves' dermopathy ) is characterized by the thickening of the skin on the shins and feet Histological findings: Tall, crowded follicular epithelial cells Scalloped colloid</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Pituitary adenoma: This is a cause of endogenous hypersecretion of thyroid hormone, but it leads to secondary hyperthyroidism rather than primary hyperthyroidism, as the excess secretion is due to the adenoma secreting excessive TSH which stimulates the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormone. Option: C. Multinodular goitre: Multinodular goitre can cause hyperthyroidism due to the autonomous production of thyroid hormones by the nodules. However, it is not the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Option: D. Adenomatoid goitre: Adenomatoid goitre is a type of nodular goitre, but it is not a common cause of hyperthyroidism. Like multinodular goitre, it can cause hyperthyroidism due to the autonomous production of thyroid hormone by the adenoma, but this is not the most common cause of hyperthyroidism.</p>\n<p></p>",
