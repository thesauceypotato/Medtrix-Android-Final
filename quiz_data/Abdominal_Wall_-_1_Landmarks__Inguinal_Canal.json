      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>This type of hernia can occur due to patency of processus vaginalis The above clinical scenario with Zieman\u2019s test showing impulse on the index finger placed at the deep inguinal ring suggests an Indirect inguinal hernia that can occur due to patent processus vaginalis. The patient given above has an indirect inguinal hernia. Zieman\u2019s test differentiates between indirect(index finger), direct(middle finger), and femoral hernia(ring finger). The swelling is reduced, then the fingers are placed as mentioned above. Later patient is asked to cough. The impulse felt on the specified finger fetches the diagnosis of the type of hernia. Indirect inguinal hernia can occur due to partial or complete patency of the processus vaginalis, an invagination of the peritoneum. Types of indirect inguinal hernia : Bubonocele. The hernia is limited to the inguinal canal. Funicular. The processus vaginalis is closed just above the epididymis. The contents of the sac can be felt separately from the testis, which lies below the hernia. Complete (synonym: scrotal). A full inguinal hernia rarely occurs at birth but is commonly encountered in infancy. It can also occur in adolescence or in adulthood. The testis appears to lie within the lower part of the hernia.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. The inferior epigastric artery lies lateral to a direct hernia and medial to an indirect hernia. That means In the indirect inguinal hernia, the hernial sac passes lateral to the inferior epigastric artery, NOT MEDIAL as given in option A Option: C. In an Indirect inguinal hernia, the hernial sac passes through the deep inguinal ring with a small diameter. Thus, this type of hernia has a narrow neck. Direct inguinal hernias are less susceptible to strangulation as they have wide channels than indirect hernias. Option: D. Direct hernia is more common in older age, whereas indirect hernia is common in younger generation.</p>\n<p></p>",

Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) CDH is the herniation of bowel contents into the thoracic cavity due to diaphragm defects. Types - This hernia is congenital. Here, the abdominal contents herniate into the thoracic cavity through the posterolateral hernia of Bochdalek. It is an acute presentation in infants.
