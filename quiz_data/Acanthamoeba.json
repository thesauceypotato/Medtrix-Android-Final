In humans, acanthamoeba causes: \u2022 Keratitis; Granulomatous encephalitis ; \u2022 fulminant meningoencephalitis. Mode of Infection Corneal infection with Acanthamoeba results from direct corneal contact with any material or water contaminated with the organism . Risk factors of contamination : Contact lens wearers using home-made saline (from contaminated tap water and saline tablets) is the commonest situation recognised for acanthamoeba infection in western countries. Trauma associated with contaminated matter such as vegetable matter, sail water diving, windblown contaminants. and hot tub use forms the non-contact lens-related situations. Trauma with organic matter and exposure to muddy water are the major (90% of cases) predisposing factors in developing countries. Opportunistic infection . Acanthamoeba keratitis can also occur as an opportunistic infection in patients with herpetic keratitis, bacterial keratitis, bullous keratopathy, and neuroparalytic keratitis. Clinical features: Symptoms: These vary from asymptomatic to foreign body sensation , mild pain to severe pain (out of proportion to the degree of inflammation due to perineural invasion ) , watering, photophobia , blepharospasm, and blurred vision . Signs: Gradual worsening keratitis Epithelial lesions: epithelial roughening and irregularities , Epithelial ridges , Radial keratoneuritis, reported in 50% of cases, seems to be a pathognomonic early sign; pseudodendrites formation occurs, and at this stage, it is commonly mistaken for herpes simplex keratitis. Limbal lesions: limbitis Stromal lesions: patchy and satellite stromal infiltrates \u2022 Ring infiltrates, central or paracentral, with overlying epithelial defects and underlying keratic precipitates Ring abscess Scleritis , usually anterior diffuse or nodular, can be contiguous with keratitis. Laboratory diagnosis : Corneal scrapings may be helpful in some cases, as under: Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is reliable in experienced hands for the recognition of Acanthamoeba cysts. Calcofluor white stain is a fluorescent brightener that stains the cysts of Acanthamoeba bright apple green under a fluorescence microscope. Lactophenol- stained cotton film is also useful for demonstrating of acanthamoeba cysts in the corneal scrapings. Culture on non-nutrient agar (E. coli-enriched ) may show trophozoites within 48 hours, which gradually turn into cysts. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amoebic DNA is reported to be useful. Corneal biopsy, which may be required in non-conclusive cases, may be positive for amoebic cysts. Treatment: Specific treatment Topical antiamoebic agents include: Diamidines: Propamidine isethionate (0.1 %), and hexamidine (0. I%). Biguanides: Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) , 0.02% and chlorhexidine, 0.02%. Aminoglycosides: neomycin and Paromomycin Imidazoles:\u00b7clotrimazole and miconazole. Multiple drug therapy is needed for a long time (3-4 months) for early epithelial lesions and 6-12 months for stromal lesions. Any of the following combinations may be chosen: Propamidine or hexamidine + PHMB (drug of choice ) Chlorhexidine + Neomycin, Paromomycin + clotrimazole,  miconazole or itraconazole . Frequency of instillation: hourly for a week, then taper slowly over 3-4 months for epithelial lesions and 6-12 months for stromal lesions. Oral ketoconazole 200 mg BID, or itraconazole 100 mg BD may be added in advanced cases. Long-term prophylactic therapy with PHMB , twice a day for a year, is recommended .

Aspergillus: For filamentous fungi (Aspergillus and Fusarium) , natamycin (5%) eye drops (drug of choice) or amphotericin B (0.01 to 0.3%), or fluconazole (0.2%), miconazole (IO mg/ml), or voriconazole (10%) eye drops.

A provisional diagnosis of AK can be made using clinical features and confocal microscopy, although a definitive diagnosis requires culture, histology, or identification of Acanthamoeba deoxyribonucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction . Routine use of tissue diagnosis is recommended, particularly for patients unresponsive to treatment for AK . Topical biguanides are the only effective therapy for the resistant encysted form of the organism in vitro, if not always in vivo.</p>\n<p></p>",

This is usually associated with wearing contact lenses for a longer duration than prescribed . Amoebae can be introduced through environmental exposures such as swimming and showering while wearing contact lenses, contaminating lenses or cases with wet hands, \"topping off\" lens solution bottles , or using contaminated contact lens solutions, especially homemade solutions. Rare reports cite radial keratotomies preceding this infection. Medical treatment consists of topical antimicrobial agents, which can achieve high concentrations at the site of the infection. Because the cystic form may be highly resistant to therapy, a combination of agents is generally used.
