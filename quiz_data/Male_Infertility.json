      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Genital tract obstruction Genital tract obstruction is the correct answer here. Azoospermia can occur because of reproductive tract obstruction or inadequate production of spermatozoa. History, physical examination and hormone analysis point toward the cause of Obstructive azoospermia which may be congenital (absence of the vas deferens, idiopathic epididymal obstruction) or acquired (from infection, vasectomy, trauma). Couples in whom the man has congenital reproductive tract obstruction should have cystic fibrosis gene mutation analysis for both partners, as there is a high risk of the male being a CF. Acquired obstruction of the genital tract can be treated using microsurgical reconstruction .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Diagnosis of Male Infertility: In azoospermia, the diagnostic test which can distinguish between testicular failure and obstruction of vas deferens is the Estimation of FSH levels. A very high FSH would indicate a testicular cause . A very low FSH would indicate pretesticular cause . A normal FSH would indicate a post-testicular cause. Cause Lab Test Pretesticular cause -defect lies at the level of hypothalamus or pituitary, hence GnRH decreases, leading to decrease in LH,FSH and Testosterone. LH decreased FSH decreased Testicular volume decreased Testosterone decreased Testicular cause -defect lies at the level of testis hence decreased testosterone, thus negative feedback on FSH is lost-so FSH increases Testosterone decrease So negative feedback on FSH is lost. Therefore FSH is increased. Testicular volume is decreased. Post testicular cause LH/FSH/Testosterone all are normal FSH normal LH normal Testosterone is normal Testicular volume is normal</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A Androgen insensitivity syndrome results from the inability of cells to respond to androgens. In males, this can prevent masculinisation of the genitalia and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. therefore some phenotypic abnormalities, as well as elevated LH levels. Option: C LH is raised in cases of idiopathic testicular failure. Option: D Kallman's syndrome is hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency associated with hyposmia or anosmia. Serum LH and FDH are low.</p>\n<p></p>",

General: height increase in Kallmann and Klinefelter syndrome is due to late closure of epiphyses of the bones. Weight and obesity may point towards hormonal defects. The secondary sexual characters are abnormal in Klinefelter Syndrome, i.e. gynecomastia associated with Tumer-like stigmata. Thyroid enlargement of enlarged breast and hirsutism may be noted. Blood pressure should be checked Local examination includes an examination the of penis and scrotum and surgical scar. After this special investigations should be done : Special investigations comprise the following: Semen analysis. Hormonal assays.
