Clinical features- Transient visual obstruction Pulsatile tinnitus Visual field constriction progressing to Central visual loss 6th nerve palsy may be only focal(false localizing sign) Risk factors- Obesity Recent weight gain Pregnancy Outdated tetracycline Vit A deficiency Hypervitaminosis A Investigations Lumbar tap High opening pressure CSF Normal Fundus examination- Retinal vessel obscured Splinter hemorrhage present. Papilledema means optic disc edema from raised intracranial pressure. This young woman developed acute papilledema, with hemorrhages and cotton-wool spots, as a rare side effect of treatment with tetracycline for acne. -Treatment Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors- Acetazolamide lowers intracranial pressure by reducing the production of cerebrospinal fluid and improving the visual fields . Weight reduction- vital Diet control Bariatric surgery Shunt- Severe/progressive vision loss Fulminant papilledema Optic nerve sheath fenestration - less effective approach does not address other neurologic symptoms. Placement of a stent across the junction of the transverse and sigmoid dural sinuses, where stenosis is usually present, has emerged as a new treatment option.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A.Optic nerve sheath fenestration- is a less effective approach and does not address other neurological symptoms hence acetazolamide is a better option among the given options. Option C.Furosemide -has no role in pseudotumor cerebri. Option D.Send CSF autoimmune panel -There no features suggestive of autoimmune encephalitis and CSF is normal. and hence an autoimmune panel is not necessary.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Papilledema Patient has a history of Recurrent headache , with transient visual loss(Raised ICP) , Fundus shows optic disc swelling. Raised intracranial pressure with Optic disc swelling is known as papilledema.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Papilledema- when a disc swelling is secondary to increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Differential diagnosis- Optic disc edema(swelling alone) Pseudopapilledema(optic disc drusen) Root cause- Brain tumor CNS inflammation Cerebral venous thrombosis Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Symptoms - Headache Transient visual obscurations only one eye or simultaneously in both eyes usually last seconds but can persist longer. Obscurations follow abrupt shifts in posture or happen spontaneously. When obscurations are prolonged or spontaneous, the papilledema is more threatening. Examination- Visual acuity Not affected by papilledema unless the papilledema is severe, longstanding , or accompanied by macular edema and hemorrhage. Visual field testing Enlarged blind spots and peripheral constriction With unremitting papilledema Peripheral visual field loss progresses in an insidious fashion while the optic nerve develops atrophy. Reduction of optic disc swelling is an ominous sign of a dying nerve rather than an encouraging indication of resolving papilledema. Neuroimaging Positive- An intracranial lesion. A dural venous sinus thrombosis An arteriovenous shunt. Negative - The subarachnoid opening pressure should be measured in the lateral decubitus position by lumbar puncture. An elevated pressure, with normal cerebrospinal fluid, points by exclusion to the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect Options: - Option A. Diabetic retinopathy- In advanced diabetic retinopathy, the proliferation of neovascular vessels leads to blindness from vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and glaucoma. OptionB. Glaucoma-Glaucoma is a slowly progressive, insidious optic neuropathy that usually is associated with chronic elevation of intraocular pressure. As fibers are destroyed, the neural rim of the optic disc shrinks and the physiologic cup within the optic disc enlarges leading to pathologic \u201ccupping.\u201d . OptionD. Retinitis pigmentosa -group of rod-cone dystrophies is characterized by progressive night blindness, visual field constriction with a ring scotoma, loss of acuity, and an abnormal electroretinogram (ERG).

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Left eye RAPD The image shows a swinging flashlight test being performed which shows a left eye RAPD (Relative Afferent Pupillary defect) Because In this patient In the dark, the pupils are equal and relatively large. Shining a flashlight into the right eye evokes equal, strong constriction of both pupils. Swinging the flashlight over to the damaged left eye causes dilation of both pupils , although they remain smaller than in the dark. Swinging the flashlight back over to the healthy right eye would result in symmetric constriction.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>RAPD (Relative Afferent Pupillary defect) Pathophysiology of the RAPD includes the following: When light is directed into either eye, both pupils react equally . The brighter the light source, the greater the degree of bilateral pupillary constriction. The amount of pupillary constriction from the same light source directed to either eye should be identical. In unilateral optic nerve (or retinal ganglion cell) dysfunction, the light signal received by the brainstem efferent centers is relatively less than when the same light source is presented to the unaffected eye . Hence, both pupils constrict less when the involved eye is stimulated and more when the normal eye is stimulated. Demonstration of a relative afferent pupil defect (Marcus Gunn pupil) in the left eye, done with the patient fixating on a distant target. With dim background lighting, the pupils are equal and relatively large. Shining a flashlight into the right eye evokes equal, strong constriction of both pupils. Swinging the flashlight over to the damaged left eye causes dilation of both pupils, although they remain smaller than in A. Swinging the flashlight back over to the healthy right eye would result in symmetric constriction back to the appearance shown in B. Note that the pupils always remain equal; the damage to the left retina/ optic nerve is revealed by weaker bilateral pupil constriction to a flashlight in the left eye compared with the right eye</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A. Normal response -This is not a normal response as pupils are not constricting when light is shown to the left eye. Option B.Right eye RAPD \u2013 Shining a light into the right eye evokes a strong equal constriction of both pupils . Therefore this is not a case of right-eye RAPD. Option D. Dry eye-Schirmer's test is used for the diagnosis of dry eye and not swinging flashlight test.</p>\n<p></p>",
