The mechanisms and factors involved remain ill-defined. Increased sodium and water in blood will lead to increased Hydrostatic force in the capillaries leading to increased leakage and the fluid gets collected in the subcutaneous tissue. This edema in renal disorders is first evident around the eyes and face where loose connective tissue is present.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Edema is one of the clinical hallmarks of nephrotic syndrome.

As for the intracellular fluid (ICF), the IVF will not have a direct effect on its volume or osmolarity. This is because the ICF is located inside the cells, which are separated from the bloodstream by cell membranes. Overall, the effect of IVF administration will be an increase in ECF volume and no change in ICF volume or osmolarity. It is important to note that the specific type and rate of IVF administration can also have additional effects on electrolyte balance, acid-base status, and other factors related to fluid and electrolyte homeostasis.</p>\n<p></p>",

The loss of gastric (hydrochloric) acid leads to an increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration and metabolic alkalosis.

Because there is an increased level of bicarbonate in the glomerular filtrate, there will be an increase in bicarbonate reabsorption. The rate of filtration will exceed the rate of H+ secretion, and there will be a continuous loss of bicarbonate. As the plasma bicarbonate falls, the pH will continue to approach the normal of 7.4 and the ventilatory rate will increase gradually. When all the excess bicarbonate has been excreted, the plasma bicarbonate and pH will have returned to normal with a normal respiratory rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Rest all options are explained above.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Some Important facts:- Carbonic acids are substances whose end products of metabolism are CO2 and water, such as triglycerides and carbohydrates. Noncarbonic or fixed acids are substances whose end products of metabolism are nonvolatile, such as phosphoric acid and sulfuric acid produced from phospholipids and protein breakdown. The rate of bicarbonate reabsorption is dependent on the relative rates of bicarbonate filtration and H+ secretion. The rate of urinary acid excretion is limited by the availability of titratable acids and NH3. Ammoniagenesis is the primary adaptive response of the kidney to chronic acidosis. The isohydric principle states that in a mixed solution, all the acid-base pairs are in equilibrium with each other.</p>\n<p></p>",
