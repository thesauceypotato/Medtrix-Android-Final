A defect in the LYST gene results in defective phagolysosome formation , impairing phagocyte function and susceptibility to infections . The main leukocyte abnormalities are neutropenia (decreased numbers of neutrophils), defective degranulation , and delayed microbial killing . Leukocytes contain giant granules , which can be readily seen in peripheral blood smears and are thought to result from aberrant phagolysosome fusion. In addition, there are abnormalities in melanocytes (leading to albinism ), cells of the nervous system (associated with nerve defects ), and platelets (causing bleeding disorders ).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. NADPH oxidase acts via superoxide ions. True . Option: B. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is due to defective phagolysosome formation. True . Option: D. Myeloperoxidase action is mainly due to OCI- True .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Chronic Granulomatous Disease Inherited defects in microbicidal activity . The importance of oxygen-dependent bactericidal mechanisms is shown by the existence of a group of congenital disorders called chronic granulomatous disease , which are characterised by defects in bacterial killing and render patients susceptible to recurrent bacterial infection . Chronic granulomatous disease results from inherited defects in the genes encoding components of phagocyte oxidase (PHOX gene) , the phagolysosomal enzyme that generates superoxide (O 2\u2022), causing a defective Respiratory burst . The most common variants are an X-linked defect in one of the membrane-bound components ( gp91phox ) and autosomal recessive defects in the genes encoding two cytoplasmic components ( p47phox and p67phox ). The Nitroblue tetrazolium test is helpful for screening . Defects in neutrophil function , as in chronic granulomatous disease, increase susceptibility to infections with aureus, some gram-negative bacteria, and fungi .</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Granuloma will be present As it is an acute condition, granuloma will not be formed. Granuloma is seen in chronic inflammation .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>In the usual hematoxylin and eosin preparations, the activated macrophages in granulomas have pink granular cytoplasm with indistinct cell boundaries. They are called epithelioid cells because they resemble epithelia. A collar of lymphocytes surrounds the aggregates of epithelioid macrophages. Older granulomas may have a rim of fibroblasts and connective tissue . Frequently, but not invariably, multinucleated giant cells 40 to 50 \u00b5m in diameter are found in granulomas called Langhans giant cells . They consist of a large mass of cytoplasm and many nuclei , and they derive from the fusion of multiple activated macrophages. In granulomas associated with certain infectious organisms (most classically Mycobacterium tuberculosis ), a combination of hypoxia and free radical-mediated injury leads to a central zone of necrosis .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Neutrophils will be the first to arrive at the lesion. True, because neutrophils have the maximum number among the WBCs in blood, they will first come at the site of inflammation. Option: B. Vasodilation will cause erythema. Due to inflammation, there will be vasodilation which will cause erythema. Option: D. If group A beta-hemolytic bacteria are present, it may cause rheumatic fever. True, infection with group A beta-hemolytic bacteria can cause rheumatic fever.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Grossly , this has a granular, cheesy appearance and is therefore called caseous necrosis . Microscopically , this necrotic material appears as amorphous, structureless, eosinophilic, granular debris with a complete loss of cellular details . The granulomas in Crohn's disease, sarcoidosis, and foreign body reactions tend NOT to have necrotic centres and are said to be noncaseating .
