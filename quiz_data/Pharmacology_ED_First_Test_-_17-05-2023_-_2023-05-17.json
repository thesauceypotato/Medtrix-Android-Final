As a result, their renal clearance is limited.</li><li>\u2022 On the other hand, when the urine pH is alkaline, the renal clearance of a weak acid drug is greater than the GFR. In alkaline urine, weak acid drugs become ionized, which promotes their excretion into the urine.

Phenytoin is primarily metabolized through hepatic oxidation, mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically CYP2C9. It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism rather than acetylation. On the other hand, the other drugs mentioned are metabolized by acetylation: Isoniazid (Choice A) is an antituberculosis medication that undergoes rapid acetylation in the liver. Acetylation plays a significant role in the metabolism of isoniazid, and variations in acetylation rates can impact its therapeutic efficacy and side effects. Hydralazine (Choice B), an antihypertensive drug, is also metabolized by acetylation. Acetylation is a major pathway involved in the elimination of hydralazine from the body. Procainamide (Choice C), an antiarrhythmic medication, undergoes extensive acetylation for its metabolism. Acetylation is a major metabolic pathway for procainamide, and acetylator phenotype variations can affect the drug's efficacy and potential toxicity. Therefore, the drug that is NOT metabolized by acetylation among the options provided is phenytoin (Choice D).

Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires hepatic activation by cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP 2C19, to form its active metabolite. This active metabolite inhibits platelet aggregation and helps prevent further clot formation in patients at risk for stroke. However, some individuals have genetic variations that result in poor metabolism of clopidogrel by CYP 2C19, leading to reduced effectiveness of the drug. This phenomenon is known as clopidogrel resistance. Patients who are poor metabolizers of clopidogrel may have a higher risk of recurrent stroke despite taking the medication as prescribed</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Methyl dopa</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation</li><li>\u2022 Methyldopa is considered a safe and effective antihypertensive agent for use during pregnancy. It has been extensively studied and has a long history of use in pregnant women without significant adverse effects on the fetus. Methyldopa acts centrally by stimulating alpha-2-adrenergic receptors in the brain, leading to decreased sympathetic outflow and a subsequent reduction in blood pressure.</li><li>\u2022 Choice A, bumetanide, is a loop diuretic that is not typically used as first-line therapy for hypertension in pregnancy. Loop diuretics can cause volume depletion and electrolyte imbalances, which may be harmful to both the mother and the fetus.</li><li>\u2022 Choice B, fosinopril, is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and is contraindicated during pregnancy. ACE inhibitors are associated with fetal abnormalities, including renal malformations and impaired fetal growth. They should be avoided in pregnant women due to their potential to cause harm to the developing fetus.</li><li>\u2022 Choice C, hydrochlorothiazide, is a thiazide diuretic that is generally not recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension in pregnancy. Thiazide diuretics may reduce placental perfusion and have the potential to negatively affect fetal growth.</li><li>\u2022 Therefore, methyldopa (Choice D) is the most appropriate antihypertensive agent for initial therapy in this pregnant patient with chronic hypertension. It provides effective blood pressure control while minimizing potential harm to the mother and fetus.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
