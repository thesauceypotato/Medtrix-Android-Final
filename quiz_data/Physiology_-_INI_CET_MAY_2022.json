In non-pregnant women: Plasma fibrinogen averages 300 mg/dL (200-400 mg/dL) In Normal pregnancy plasma fibrinogen concentration increases 50% There is also a decrease in the anticoagulant mechanisms, such as resistance to activated protein C and decreased levels of protein S. In addition, the increased uterine pressure slows down the venous return into the heart, making the blood more likely to clot.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Attachment of ATP on Myosin Head The detachment of the myosin head from actin occurs when ATP (adenosine triphosphate) binds to the myosin head.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Each Myosin: 2 heavy chains + 4 light chains Head Of myosin has ATPase enzyme The motion of muscle shortening occurs as myosin heads bind to actin and pull the actin inwards. This action requires energy, which is provided by ATP. Myosin binds to actin at a binding site on the globular actin protein. Myosin has another binding site for ATP at which enzymatic activity hydrolyzes ATP to ADP, releasing an inorganic phosphate molecule and energy. ATP binding causes myosin to release actin, allowing actin and myosin to detach from each other. After this happens, the newly bound ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate, P i . The enzyme at the binding site on myosin is called ATPase. The energy released during ATP hydrolysis changes the angle of the myosin head into a \u201ccocked\u201d position. The myosin head is then in a position for further movement, possessing potential energy, but ADP and P i are still attached. If actin binding sites are covered and unavailable, the myosin will remain in the high energy configuration with ATP hydrolyzed, but still attached. If the actin binding sites are uncovered, a cross-bridge will form; that is, the myosin head spans the distance between the actin and myosin molecules. P i is then released, allowing myosin to expend the stored energy as a conformational change. The myosin head moves toward the M line, pulling the actin along with it. As the actin is pulled, the filaments move approximately 10 nm toward the M line. This movement is called the power stroke, as it is the step at which force is produced. During contraction: Actin \u2013Myosin interaction takes place (attachment of ADP on Myosin head). During relaxation: Myosin head detached from Actin (attachment of ATP on Myosin head).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option A - Release of ADP and Pi - this occurs for releasing the stored energy in myosin head in the form of a conformational change - and so power stroke is generated.

Statement: 1 and 3: In skin and testes, it helps in temperature regulation ( Countercurrent Heat Exchange ). Blood flowing from the core to the periphery (like the legs & feet) carries heat that can be readily lost through the skin . Similarly for testis, blood that returns from the testes through the plexuses is cooler than the blood in testicular arteries. The arterial blood is cooled by venous blood by a counter-current heat exchange mechanism. Statement: 4: In the Intestine it helps in better absorption of nutrients. Statement: 2: In the kidney it helps in maintaining the Hyperosmolarity of Medullary interstitium.

Option B - this is not by facilitated diffusion - it is a primary active transport. Ca2+ into sarcoplasmic reticulum requires SERCA ( SarcoEndoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Transport ATPase). The pump is found in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In some cases, it is so plentiful that it may make up 90% of the protein there. Powered by ATP, it pumps calcium ions back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum , reducing the calcium level around the actin and myosin filaments and allowing the muscle to relax. Nervous stimulation leads to depolarization of the sarcolemma (muscle membrane) that triggers calcium ions' release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Option C - Glucose - secondary active transport facilitated by Sodium- Glucose transporter. So, this can be ruled out. Option D - ion channel transport - There are ion channels specific for K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Cl\u2013, as well as channels that are nonselective for cations or anions. Each type of channel exists in multiple forms with diverse properties. Most are made up of identical or very similar sub units.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Respiratory Acidosis The physiological adaptation that does not happen at high altitudes is respiratory acidosis. Respiratory alkalosis is the physiological adaptation seen at high altitudes due to hyperventilation and not respiratory acidosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Compensatory mechanisms that are carried out to increase altitude tolerance (acclimatization) include: Hyperventilation causing respiratory alkalosis and shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left (and shifts to right after acclimatization). Increased erythropoietin secretion causing an increasing shift in the number of circulating red blood cells Increased number of mitochondria to provide more energy Increased myoglobin to facilitate the movement of O2 into the tissues Increased tissue cytochrome oxidase Increased sympathetic tone</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option B - Pulmonary vasoconstriction occurs due to the lack of smooth muscles in the pulmonary arteries in response to hypoxia Option A - Polycythemia - Erythropoietin secretion increases on the ascent to high altitude which results in polycythemia Option C - Total barometric pressure decreases as altitude increases, resulting in decreased Po 2 (partial pressure of oxygen) leading to hypoxic hypoxia.</p>\n<p></p>",
