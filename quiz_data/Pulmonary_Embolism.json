D-Dimer assays are highly sensitive for presence of thromboembolic Disease D-Dimer test is useful as a test for exclusion' or a 'rule out test and is not a diagnostic test. 2.CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), Which can show clots down to 5th-order pulmonary arteries (after the 4th branching). This may also be useful for subjects with indeterminant on isotope scans. Now it is the best screening test V/Q scan (look for perfusion defects with no corresponding ventilation defects).

Cardiac tamponade-D dimer has no role to play in the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade as chest Xray and ECG are used for the diagnosis Option: D. Acute myocardial infarction- cardiac troponins and ECG are mainly used for the diagnosis The quantitative plasma d-dimer enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) rises in the presence of DVT or PE because of the breakdown of fibrin by plasmin. Elevation of d-dimer indicates endogenous although often clinically ineffective thrombolysis. The sensitivity of the d-dimer is >80% for DVT (including isolated calf DVT) and >95% for PE. The d-dimer is less sensitive for DVT than for PE because the DVT thrombus size is smaller. A normal d-dimer is a useful \u201crule out\u201d test for PE. However, the d-dimer assay is not specific. Levels increase in patients with myocardial infarction, pneumonia, sepsis, cancer, the postoperative state, and those in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Therefore, d-dimer rarely has a useful role among hospitalized patients, because levels are frequently elevated due to systemic illness.</p>\n<p></p>",
