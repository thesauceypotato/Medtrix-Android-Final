This factor is required for translocation of polypeptidyl-transfer RNA from the acceptor to the donor site on the eukaryotic ribosome. Toxin Fragment A inactivates EF-2 by catalyzing a reaction that yields free nicotinamide plus an inactive adenosine diphosphate-ribose-EF-2 complex (ADP-ribosylation).

PA is a protein that binds to specific cell receptors, and after proteolytic activation, it forms a membrane channel that mediates entry of EF and LF into the cell. EF is an adenylate cyclase; with PA, it forms a toxin known as edema toxin. Edema toxin is responsible for cell and tissue edema. LF plus PA form lethal toxin, which is a major virulence factor and cause of death in infected animals and humans. Invasion of the mucosal epithelial cells (eg, M cells) by induced phagocytosis , escape from the phagocytic vacuole, multiplication and spread within the epithelial cell cytoplasm, and passage to adjacent cells. Microabscesses in the wall of the large intestine and terminal ileum lead to necrosis of the mucous membrane, superficial ulceration, bleeding , and formation of a \u201cpseudomembrane\u201d on the ulcerated area. This consists of fibrin, leukocytes, cell debris, a necrotic mucous membrane, and bacteria. As the process subsides, granulation tissue fills the ulcers, and scar tissue forms</p>\n<p></p>",

Temperature Patterns: Temperature may subside around the third day and rise again about 5-8 days after onset (saddleback form). Rash Appearance: A rash may appear on the third or fourth day and lasts for 1-5 days. Lymph Nodes: Lymph nodes are frequently enlarged. Disease Course: Classic dengue fever is a self-limited disease.

Blood Investigations: Can lead to complications like renal impairment (elevated creatinine) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet levels).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Scrub Typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi): Clinical Resemblance to Epidemic Typhus: Scrub typhus shares clinical similarities with epidemic typhus. Eschar Formation: Feature: Presence of an eschar, a punched-out ulcer covered with a blackened scab. Indication: Marks the location of the mite bite. Clinical Manifestations: Generalized Lymphadenopathy: Common feature. Lymphocytosis: Frequent finding in patients. Severity of Illness: Illness can be severe. Complications: Associated cardiac and cerebral involvement. Mortality: Approximately 30% of patients may experience fatal outcomes. Note: Scrub typhus is caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi and is transmitted by chiggers (larval stage of trombiculid mites). The presence of an eschar is a distinctive feature in its clinical presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Anthrax: Clinical Presentation: Skin lesion in anthrax typically appears as an ulcer with a characteristic black center (eschar). Blood Investigations: Unlikely to cause significant changes in creatinine levels or platelet counts. Option: B. Leptospirosis: Clinical Presentation: May present with fever and skin rash, but skin lesions are typically not a prominent feature. Blood Investigations: Leptospirosis can lead to renal involvement, but the platelet levels might not be as markedly decreased as described. Option: C. Brucellosis: Clinical Presentation: Unlikely to present with a skin lesion as shown. Blood Investigations: While brucellosis can affect various organs, it does not typically cause skin lesions like those seen in the image. In this question, given the skin lesion, fever, elevated creatinine, and decreased platelet levels, the likely diagnosis is D. Scrub Typhus.</p>\n<p></p>",
