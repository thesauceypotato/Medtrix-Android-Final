      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Paralysis of lower facial muscles left side It is a General Rule that: UMN lesion cause - Contralateral paresis and LMN lesion cause - ipsilateral paresis . So, the right upper motor neuron lesion of a facial nerve will lead to paresis/deformity of the left side. (Ruling out options \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d) In Right UMN Palsy \u2013 Facial muscles of the opposite side (left side) will be affected . Upper facial (forehead) muscles will be spared . So patient will have paralysis of the lower facial muscles on the contralateral (left) side.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Forehead receives bilateral innervation and is thus saved in supranuclear paralysis. Emotional movements controlled by thalamo-nuclear fibres are also preserved.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A- As the right UMN is involved so left side will be affected, not the right side. Option B- as the right UMN is involved so left side will be affected, not the right side. Option C- upper/ forehead muscles are spared in UMN palsy.</p>\n<p></p>",
