      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Brachytherapy Brachytherapy refers to a treatment in which a radioisotope is placed onto or inside the volume to be treated.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>One of the key features of brachytherapy is that the irradiation affects only a very localised area around the radiation sources because dose falls off rapidly, obeying the inverse square law. As long as the sources are placed precisely within the tumour, there is minimal exposure to radiation of healthy tissues further away from the sources. This allows very high doses to be administered to the target volume.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B. Teletherapy is the use of radioactive material, such as 60Co , for production of an external beam of gamma rays for treatment at a distance from the radioactive source Option C. External beam radiotherapy constitutes the mainstay of radiation treatment. It uses a radiation beam that originates at a distance from the patient and is directed towards a defined treatment volume. Approximately 85% of all therapeutic radiation exposures are delivered using external beam techniques. Various types and energies of radiation can be delivered in this way, including electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and \u03b3-rays, or particles such as electrons and protons. Higher energies of radiation penetrate deeper into body tissues. Option D. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced type of radiation therapy used to treat cancer and noncancerous tumors. IMRT uses advanced technology to manipulate photon and proton beams of radiation to conform to the shape of a tumor.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Brachytherapy allows targeting a smaller area than external radiation therapy, which directs high-energy x-rays from outside the body. The main benefit of brachytherapy is the ability to destroy cancerous cells in a more efficient way while minimizing the side effects for the patient.</p>\n<p></p>",
