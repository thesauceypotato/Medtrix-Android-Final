Different types of mutations in HGPRTase gene have been identified in patients with Lesch Nyhan syndrome. There is deficiency of HGPRTase. So, the rate of salvage pathway is decreased resulting in accumulation of PRPP and decreased level of inhibitory purine nucleotides. The disease is characterized by self-mutilation, mental retardation, excessive uric acid and nephrolithiasis. Gout develops in later life. The neurological manifestations suggest that the brain is dependent on the salvage pathway for the requirements of IMP and GMP.

It is an inborn error of metabolism. Due to the block in this enzyme, galactose-1- phosphate will accumulate in the liver. This will inhibit galactokinase as well as glycogen phosphorylase. Hypoglycemia is the result. Bilirubin uptake is less and bilirubin conjugation is reduced; so unconjugated bilirubin level is increased in blood There is enlargement of liver, jaundice and severe mental retardation . Free galactose accumulates, leading to It is partly excreted in urine ( galactosuria ). Galactose is reduced to dulcitol (see Chapter 6). The accumulation of dulcitol in the lens results in cataract due to its osmotic effect. This is called congenital cataract and is a very characteristic feature of galactosemia.

Edema of legs, face, trunk and serous cavities are the main features. Palpitation, breathlessness and distended neck veins are observed. Death occurs due to heart failure. Dry beriberi- In this condition, CNS manifestations are the major features. Walking becomes difficult. Peripheral neuritis with sensory disturbance leads to complete paralysis. Infantile beriberi- It occurs in infants born to mothers suffering from thiamine deficiency. Restlessness and sleeplessness are observed. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome- It is also called as cerebral beriberi. Clinical features are those of encephalopathy (ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, cerebellar ataxia) plus psychosis. It is seen only when the nutritional status is severely affected. Polyneuritis- It is common in chronic alcoholics. Alcohol utilization needs large doses of thiamine. Alcohol inhibits intestinal absorption of thiamine, leading to thiamine deficiency.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA WATER SOLUBLE VITAMINS Name Co-enzyme form RDA Main reaction using the co-enzyme Deficiency disease Thiamine Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) 1-1.5 mg Oxidative decarboxylation of alpha keto acids Beriberi Riboflavin Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) 1.5 mg Dehydrogenation, oxidized in ETC (1.5 ATP) Glossitis, angular stomatitis Niacin Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD and NADP) 20 mg Dehydrogenation, oxidized in ETC (2.5 ATP), reductive biosynthetic reactions and hydroxylation Pellagra Pyridoxine Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) 1-2 mg Transamination, decarboxylation of amino acids Seizures, anemia, homocystinuria Pantothenic acid Co-enzyme A, ACP 10 mg CoA derivatives, acyl carrier proteins Burning foot syndrome Biotin Biotin 200-300 mg Carboxylation No specific disease</p>\n<p></p>",

Lactase is present in the brush border of enterocytes. Deficiency of lactase leads to lactose intolerance. In this condition, lactose accumulates in the gut. Irritant diarrhea and flatulence are seen. The causes may be congenital or acquired. As age advances, lactase activity decreases and secondary lactose intolerance occurs. Acquired lactose intolerance can also occur when there is a sudden change to a milk based diet. Lactase is an inducible enzyme. If milk is withdrawn temporarily, diarrhea will be limited. Curd is also an effective treatment, because the lactobacilli present in curd contains the enzyme lactase. Lactase is abundantly seen in yeast, which could also be used in treatment. .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A.

Losses can also occur in hemodialysis. This suggests there may be a vitamin-like dietary requirement for carnitine in some individuals. It is a defect in fatty acid oxidation that leads to hypoketotic hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia. Carnitine transports activated Long chain fatty acids from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria for beta oxidation. Symptoms of deficiency include hypoglycemia, which is a consequence of impaired fatty acid oxidation, and lipid accumulation with muscular weakness.
