      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Mittelschmerz A female giving history of sharp pain in the lower abdomen, every month, 2 weeks before menstruation suggests Mittelschmerz as the diagnosis. Mittelschmerz is synonymous with painful ovulation. Pain is associated with rupture of ovarian follicle at the time of ovulation In most cases, mittelschmerz doesn't require medical attention.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mittelschmerz:mid cycle ovulatory pain Intermenstrual bleeding: bleeding between cycles Heavy menstrual bleeding :bleeding >80 ml , >8 days Hypomenorrhea : bleeding <20 ml / <2 days Oligomenorrhea: regular cycles at an interval of more than 35 days Polymenorrhea: regular cycles at an interval of fewer than 21 days</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Incorrect (Pathologic dysmenorrhea) Secondary dysmenorrhea is painful menstrual cramps due to a macroscopically identifiable underlying pelvic pathologic condition. It should be suspected in older women with no history of dysmenorrhea until proven otherwise. Option: C. Incorrect (Pelvic TB) Genital TB is asymptomatic or can present with a few symptoms among which infertility is the most common. Option: D. Incorrect (Endometriosis) Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue similar to the tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus the endometrium grows outside your uterus. The most accepted theory is Sampson\u2019s theory. It causes dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia and abdominal pain .</p>\n<p></p>",
