Hypertrichosis is often associated. Treatment: Alexandrite Laser</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Drug reaction: Drug reactions occur following intake of a drug. It can either present as a fixed drug reaction or drug-induced hypomelanosis. Drug induced hypermelanosis: Amiodarone Tetracyclines Chloroquine Clofazimine Phenytoin Anti-neoplasticism drugs: Bleomycin, busulfan, cyclophosphamide, etc Psychotropic drugs: Trifluoperazine, imipramine Drugs causing fixed drug eruptions: NSAIDS Cotrimoxazole Tetracyclines Carbamazepine Metronidazole Option C .  Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation: It is a temporary condition that follows injury (burn) or infection or dermatitis. It is aka acquired melanosis. Occur in dark-skinned individuals and is more common in persons with Fitzpatrick skin types IV, V, and VI, especially types IV and V. Hyperpigmentation may result from the following two mechanisms: Increased epidermal pigmentation via increased melanocyte activity Dermal melanosis from melanin dropout from the epidermis into the dermis Features: Lesions of hyperpigmentation tend to be tan to brown and may have a gray hue , caused by dermal melanin. Located at the site of the original disease after it has healed. Treatment: Sunscreen to minimize darkening and cosmetic camouflage. Option D .Congenital melanocytic Nevus: It is a proliferation of benign melanocytes that are present at birth or develop shortly after birth Present as single or multi-shaded, round or oval-shaped pigmented patches Congenital nevi usually enlarge as the child grows but they may sometimes become smaller and less obvious with time Giant melanocytic naevi are associated with increased risk of developing cutaneous melanoma.</p>\n<p></p>",
