It can be used to differentiate scurvy from Healing rickets.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Vitamin C is necessary for hydroxylation of lysine and proline to hydroxylysine and hydroxyproline, two aminoacids crucial for proper cross linking of triple helix of collagen. So deficiency causes failure of collagen synthesis or primitive collagen formation, throughout the body, including in blood vessels, predisposing to haemorrhage. It is also involved in neurotransmitter metabolism (conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine and tryptophan to serotonin), cholesterol metabolism (conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones and bile acids), and the biosynthesis of carnitine. Vitamin C functions to maintain the iron and copper atoms, cofactors of the metalloenzymes, in a reduced (active) state. Vitamin C is an important antioxidant (electron donor) in the aqueous milieu of the body. Vitamin C enhances nonheme iron absorption, the transfer of iron from transferrin to ferritin, and the formation of tetrahydrofolic acid and thus can affect the cellular and immunologic functions of the hematopoietic system. PATHOLOGY In scurvy, there is defective formation of connective tissues and collagen in skin, cartilage, dentine, bone, and blood vessels, leading to their fragility. In the long bones, osteoid is not deposited by osteoblasts, cortex is thin, and the trabeculae become brittle and fracture easily. Clinical Features It develops after 6-12 months of dietary deprivation. For this reason it is not seen in neonates. The early manifestations are irritability, loss of appetite, low-grade fever, musculoskeletal pain, and tenderness in the legs, restlessness and even failure to thrive. These signs and symptoms are followed by leg swelling-most marked at the knees and the ankles-and pseudoparalysis. The infant might lie with the hips and knees semiflexed and the feet rotated outward. Subperiosteal hemorrhages in the lower limb bones sometimes acutely increase the swelling and pain, and the condition might mimic acute osteomyelitis or arthritis. A \"rosary\" at the costochondral junctions and depression of the sternum are other typical features. Rachitic Rosary Scorbutic Rosary Round smooth non tender Sharp and tender Gum changes are seen in older children after teeth have erupted and are manifested as bluish purple, spongy swellings of the mucous membrane, especially over the upper incisors Anemia, a common finding in infants and young children with scurvy, is related to impaired iron absorption and coexistent hematopoietic nutrient deficiencies including iron, vitamin B12, and folate. Hemorrhagic of scurvy include petechiae, purpura, and ecchymoses at pressure points; epistaxis; gum bleeding; and the characteristic perifollicular hemorrhages Other manifestations are poor wound and fracture healing, hyperkeratosis of hair follicles, arthralgia, and muscle.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.Lateral metaphyseal spur at ends of metaphysis is produced by outward projection of the zone of provisional calcification.
