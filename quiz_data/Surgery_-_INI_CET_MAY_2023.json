Appendicitis occurs when the appendix becomes inflamed and filled with pus. Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a finger-shaped pouch that projects from your colon on the lower right side of your abdomen. Continued growth of caecum rotates the appendix in different positions. The vermiform appendix is attached dorsomedially to the end of the cecum, where all three taeniae converge. It is 2 to 15 cm long and lies often intraperitoneally retrocecal (65%) or in the lesser pelvis (30%). The appendix is attached to the posterior abdominal wall by the mesoappendix The appendix positions are Retrocecal/retrocolic: the appendix courses upwardly behind the cecum, and may reach the initial portion of the ascending colon. Most common position Pelvic: the appendix is directed downward, over the psoas major, with its tip surpassing the upper edge of the lower pelvis. Post-ileal: the distal portion of the appendix is in a position posterior-superior to the terminal ileum and directed to the spleen Subcecal: the appendix is located under the cecum, resting on the right iliac fossa and separated from the iliac muscle by a local peritoneal lining Pre-ileal: the distal portion of the appendix is located in a position anterior-superior to the terminal ileum and directed to the spleen Paracecal position: the appendix is situated laterally to the cecum and ascending colon Other (ectopic) positions: the appendix does not fit in any of the positions above described.

It is filled with saliva (spit) that has leaked out of a damaged salivary gland. A mucous extravasation cyst that arises from the sublingual gland that resembles a frog belly Etiology : Local trauma and duct rupture, followed by mucin spillage into the surrounding soft tissues (mucous extravasation phenomenon) Histopathology Mucin accumulation surrounded by granulation and fibrous tissue (mucous extravasation phenomenon) A cyst cavity, filled with mucin and lining by the ductal epithelium (mucous retention cyst) Chronic inflammation of the cyst wall is present. Infiltration by numerous neutrophils, histiocytes, and plasma cells are common Clinical Features Exclusively present on the floor of mouth Usually unilateral, lateral to midline Smooth, dome shape, fluctuating and painless swelling The color is usually bluish, but deep lesions may have a normal color. The size varies from a few to several centimeters in diameter. Very large lesions which may occupy the floor of mouth can also occur Treatment Surgical removal or marsupialization MC structure injured during ranula surgery: Submandibular duct</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Options A: Hemangioma is the most common vascular tumor and is characterized by increased abnormal proliferation of endothelium. Hemangiomas develop in infancy and are usually not visible at birth. They appear red or maroon if superficial, and bluish if deep. Option B: Cystic hygroma is usually seen in neonates and early childhood. They are cystic swellings filled with lymph fluid and are characteristically brilliantly translucent. They occur in the neck and can involve the parotid, submandibular, tongue, etc. The swelling is soft and partially compressible. Definitive treatment is the excision of the swelling. Option C: The branchial cyst develops from the vestigial remnants of the second branchial cleft. Swelling in the neck beneath the anterior border of the upper third of the sternomastoid muscle. It is smooth, soft, fluctuant, and often transilluminate.</p>\n<p></p>",
