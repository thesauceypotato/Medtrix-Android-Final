Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Lateral medullary syndrome, also known as Wallenberg syndrome or posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) syndrome , is a neurological condition caused by a blockage or disruption of blood flow in the PICA, a major artery that supplies the medulla. It results from damage to multiple structures in the medulla, including the nuclei of cranial nerves (such as the nucleus ambiguus), the spinothalamic tract, and the descending sympathetic pathways.</li><li>\u2022 Wallenberg syndrome or posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) syndrome</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Superior Cerebellar Artery: The superior cerebellar artery primarily supplies the superior surface of the cerebellum. Blockage or injury to this artery can lead to symptoms related to dysfunction of the upper cerebellum but is not associated with the classic features of lateral medullary syndrome.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Superior Cerebellar Artery:</li><li>\u2022 Option C . Posterior Superior Cerebellar Artery : The posterior superior cerebellar artery supplies the superior part of the cerebellum and the superior cerebellar peduncle. It is not directly associated with the lateral medullary syndrome. Blockage of this artery can lead to symptoms related to the superior cerebellum but not the specific features seen in lateral medullary syndrome.</li><li>\u2022 Option C</li><li>\u2022 Posterior Superior Cerebellar Artery</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Cerebral Artery: The term \"cerebral artery\" is a broad term that refers to arteries supplying the brain, including the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries. Blockage or issues with these arteries can cause various types of strokes or neurological symptoms, but they are not directly related to lateral medullary syndrome, which specifically involves the medulla and the PICA.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Cerebral Artery:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA) is a major artery that supplies the lateral and posterior parts of the medulla, as well as the inferior surface of the cerebellum. When there is an issue with the PICA, such as a clot or blockage, it can affect the blood supply to the lateral medulla. This leads to the classic symptoms of lateral medullary syndrome, including dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), hoarseness, vertigo, nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), ataxia (loss of coordination), and various sensory disturbances.</li><li>\u27a4 Lateral medullary syndrome, also known as Wallenberg syndrome, typically results from a blockage or disruption of blood flow in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA).</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Current American Cancer Society guidelines advocate colon cancer screening for the average-risk population beginning at age 50 years. Recommended procedures include yearly fecal occult blood testing (FOBT)/fecal immunohistochemical testing (FIT), flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years, or FOBT/FIT and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Visual inspection of the oral cavity has been widely used for screening oral cancer. The target population for oral cancer screening includes those aged 30 years and older who use tobacco and/or alcohol. Advantages of visual inspection include its feasibility, safety, acceptability, accuracy to detect oral precancerous and cancerous lesions, and efficacy and cost-effectiveness in reducing oral cancer mortality. Pap smear is a screening test for cervical cancer. Screening should begin at age 21 years. For women aged between 21-29 years, screening should be done every 3 years with Pap smear examination. For women aged between 30-65 years, screening should be done every 5 years with both HPV and the Pap co-test. Using mammography as a routine screening tool in women has been reported to reduce mortality from breast cancer. The United Kingdom recently established an independent expert panel to estimate the benefits and harms associated with screening women in its national screening program. The panel estimated that breast screening resulted in a 20% reduction in breast cancer mortality. The panel also noted over-diagnosis of breast carcinoma but concluded that breast screening confers significant benefits and should be continued.</li><li>\u27a4 Screening for common cancers using relatively non-invasive tests is expected to lead to early diagnosis, allow more conservative surgical therapies with decreased morbidity, and potentially improve surgical cure rates and overall survival rates.</li><li>\u27a4 Current American Cancer Society guidelines advocate colon cancer screening for the average-risk population beginning at age 50 years.

When a hormone binds to its receptor, the associated heterotrimeric G protein undergoes a conformational change. This change leads to the exchange of GDP for GTP on the G protein's alpha subunit, causing it to dissociate from the beta and gamma subunits.</li><li>\u2022 The activated GTP-bound alpha subunit then interacts with adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme located on the inner membrane of the cell. Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP). The newly formed cAMP acts as a secondary messenger that activates Protein Kinase A (PKA). PKA, in turn, phosphorylates various target proteins, leading to a cascade of cellular responses.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The correct sequence in the G protein-coupled receptor pathway is: Adenylyl cyclase activates the conversion of ATP to cAMP, which then activates Protein Kinase A (PKA).</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
