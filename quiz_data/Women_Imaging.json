      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Unicornuate uterus The given image shows the hysterosalpingogram of a unicornuate uterus. If this anomaly is suspected, 3-D sonography increases diagnostic accuracy, but again MR imaging may be preferred.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>During typical fetal development, two tubelike structures, called the Mullerian ducts, fuse together to create the uterus. The upper portions form the fallopian tubes. If one of the ducts fails to develop, it may result in a single-horned uterus, called a unicornuate uterus.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - The endometrial cavity usually assumes a fusiform (banana type) shape, tapering at the apex and draining into a single fallopian tube. The uterus is generally shifted off the midline. Bicornuate uterus has 2 cornua; but single cervix; while didelphus uterus has 2 cervices, hence other options are excluded</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Rudimentary horns also increase the risk for an ectopic pregnancy within the remnant, which may be disastrous. This risk includes noncommunicating cavitary rudiments, for which transperitoneal sperm migration permits ovum fertilization and pregnancy</p>\n<p></p>",
