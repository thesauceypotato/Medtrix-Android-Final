Autoimmune hypothyroidism is associated with goitre (Hashimoto\u2019s or goitre thyroiditis) Female to male ratio:4:1. In Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, there is marked lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid with germinal centre formation. There is atrophy of thyroid follicles and oxyphils metaplasia. In atrophic thyroiditis, there is fibrosis and thyroid follicles are absent. Marked fibrosis is also seen in igg4-positive plasma cells. It is associated with hla dr3,hladr4 and hladr5 It is associated with ctla4 a t regulatory gene and with type 1 dm, Addison\u2019s disease, pernicious anaemia, and vitiligo. A gene on chromosome 21 is associated with Down\u2019s syndrome. Antibodies to thyroxine peroxidase(TPO) and thyroglobulin. Thyrotropin binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII) measures the binding of antibodies to the receptor. Clinical features: Dry skin, decrease sweating, thinning of the epidermis, hyperkeratosis of the cornea.increased glycosaminoglycans content trap water and give rise to skin thickening without pitting leading to myxedema. Puffy face, edematous eyelids and non-pitting pretibial edema. There is the presence of pallor and yellow tinge due to carotene accumulation. Nail growth retarded, hair becomes dry and brittle and diffuse alopecia. Pt can experience constipation and weight gain, decreased libido, oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, and decrease fertility. There is an increase in stroke volume, bradycardia, increased peripheral vascular resistance, diastolic hypertension, pericardial effusion and pleural effusion. It can cause carpal tunnel syndrome and slow relaxation of tendon reflex-pseudomyotonia. Memory and concentration are also affected. There is a presence of low regional activity in the amygdala, hippocampus and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. Reversible cerebellar ataxia, dementia, psychosis and myxedema coma.
