      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Seen immediately after death Rigor mortis is not seen immediately after death. It starts one or two hours after death. Rigor mortis (death stiffening; cadaveric rigidity) is a state of stiffening of muscles, sometimes with slight shortening of the fibres. Individual cell death takes place in this stage. All muscles of the body, both voluntary and involuntary, are affected. It does not start in all muscles simultaneously (Nysten's rule). It first appears _in involuntary muscles; the myocardium becomes rigid in an hour. In India, it begins one to two hours after death and takes another two hours to develop.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: C . In individual limbs, it disappears in the same order in which it has appeared. Rigor mortis always sets in, increases and decreases gradually. Option: B & D. In India, it usually lasts 24 to 48 hours in winter and 18 to 36 hours in summer. It may begin to disappear in about 12 hours. It lasts for 2 to 3 days in temperate regions.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All muscles of the body are involved The phenomenon doesn't involve all the muscles of the body. It usually is limited to a small group of voluntary muscles. Cadaveric spasm (cataleptic rigidity) is a rare condition. (Option A) In this, the muscles contracted during life become stiff and rigid immediately after death without passing into the stage of primary relaxation. As such, the change preserves the exact attitude of the person at the time of death for several hours afterwards. The spasm is primarily a vital phenomenon that originates from normal nervous stimulation of the muscles. (Option B and D) This is usually limited to a single group of voluntary muscles and frequently involves the hands. Occasionally, the whole body is affected, as seen in soldiers shot in battle, when the body may retain the posture that it assumed at the moment of death. It is not easy to simulate this condition because of the muscles' powerful contraction, which is impossible to recreate artificially.</p>\n<p></p>",
