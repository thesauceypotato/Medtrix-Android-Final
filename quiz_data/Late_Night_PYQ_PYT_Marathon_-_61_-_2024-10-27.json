The striate cortex, also known as the primary visual cortex or V1, is involved in early visual processing, such as processing basic features of visual stimuli like edges, orientation, and motion. It does have connections to the splenium of the corpus callosum, especially for the transfer of visual information between the hemispheres. This connection allows the brain to process visual information from both eyes and integrate it into a cohesive visual experience. The splenium of the corpus callosum primarily connects various regions of the cerebral hemispheres, facilitating communication between the left and right cerebral hemispheres .</li><li>\u2022 The structure marked A in the above image is the splenium of the corpus callosum and it is connected to the striate cortex.</li><li>\u2022 The striate cortex, also known as the primary visual cortex or V1, is involved in early visual processing, such as processing basic features of visual stimuli like edges, orientation, and motion.

Hippocampus:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Optic Chiasma: The optic chiasma is not directly connected to the splenium of the corpus callosum. It is a structure located at the base of the brain where some of the optic nerve fibers from each eye cross over to the opposite side of the brain. This crossover allows for the integration of visual input from both eyes, but it occurs before the information reaches the corpus callosum.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Pons : The pons is a part of the brainstem located above the medulla and below the midbrain. It contains nuclei that deal with sleep, respiration, bladder control, hearing, taste, eye movement, facial expressions, facial sensation, and posture. While the pons does have connections with the cerebellum (mainly through the middle cerebellar peduncle), the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle doesn't happen here.</li><li>\u2022 Option A.</li><li>\u2022 Pons</li><li>\u2022 Option C .

Medulla : The medulla oblongata, commonly referred to simply as the medulla, is the lower part of the brainstem. It's continuous with the spinal cord and contains many important neural pathways and centers for autonomic functions. The medulla does contain decussations, but they are mainly associated with the pyramidal tracts (motor pathways) and not with the superior cerebellar peduncle.</li><li>\u2022 Option D</li><li>\u2022 Medulla</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The midbrain, or mesencephalon, is the uppermost part of the brainstem, lying between the pons and the diencephalon. The superior cerebellar peduncle fibers decussate (cross) in the midbrain to reach the contralateral red nucleus and thalamus. This is why lesions in the cerebellum typically affect the same side of the body: the fibers effectively \"double-cross,\" first decussating in the midbrain and then crossing again at higher levels in the brain.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
