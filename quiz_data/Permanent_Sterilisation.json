Female sterilisation is the most commonly used contraceptive method in the world Child norm for sterilzation in India: 1 child at least 1 year old Husband concert is for sterilzation atom not necessary. M/C method of post partum sterilization- Minilaparotomy M/C method of female sterilzation- Laparoscopic sterilization using falope rings Techniques It can be done laparoscopically (procedure of choice these days) or by mini laparotomy (incision <3 cms) Methods of female sterilization The basic fundamental principle in female sterilization is breaking the continuity of both fallopian tubes by removing a small segment of both tubes. Prerequisites Criteria for Eligibility (Self-declaration by the client should be the basis of this information) Patient should be Female should be below the age of 49 years and above the age of 22 years. The couple should have at least one child whose age is above one year unless the sterilization is medically indicated. Female or her partners must not have undergone sterilization in the past (not applicable in cases of failure of previous sterilization). Clients must be in a sound state of mind so as to understand the full implications of Mentally ill clients must be certified by a psychiatrist and a statement should be given by the legal guardian/spouse regarding the soundness of the client's state of mind. Site of Sterilization Sterilization is done at the junction of promixal and middle third of tube - the loop formed consists mainly of isthmus and part of ampullary region.

Can be done in conditions contraindicated for laparoscopy. Lung lesions, organic heart diseases, intra-abdominal adhesions, extreme obesity. 5. Complication life-threatening Minimal but usually not. Minimal but at times fatal. 6. Hospital stay 3-5 days. 3-4 hours. 7. Failure rate 0.1-0.3% 0.2-0.6% 8. Reversibility Difficult due to adhesions and reduced remnant tubal length. Easier and effective.
