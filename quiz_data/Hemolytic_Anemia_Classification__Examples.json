A positive direct Coombs test indicates the presence of these antibodies or complements proteins. Direct Coombs test is commonly used in the diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and hemolytic disease of the newborn. It can also be positive in ABO incompatibility , where the mother's blood type is incompatible with the baby's blood type, and in autoimmune hemolysis , where the body produces antibodies that attack its own red blood cells. However, the Direct Coombs test is typically negative in aplastic anemia , which is a disorder characterized by a decrease in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. Aplastic anemia is not caused by antibody-mediated destruction of red blood cells, so the Direct Coombs test is not helpful in its diagnosis.

This is because the cause of anemia in intracorpuscular defects, such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, is not related to the destruction of erythrocytes, but rather to a problem with their production or structure . Therefore, the transfused normal erythrocytes should function normally in the recipient's body and provide the needed oxygen-carrying capacity. Option: B. \"Donor cells have normal survival\", is the correct answer This Question is based on the knowledge that in the intracorpuscular defect of RBCs the defect lies in the RBCs itself and not in spleen or vessels and so any erythrocytes (blood \u2013 group matched) that are transfused into a patient will not be destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Blood bag additives and shelf life: Blood bag additives Shelf life Acid Citrate Dextrose 21 days Citrate Phosphate Dextrose Adenine 35 days Saline Adenine Glucose Mannitol 45 days</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

Compared with the most common normal variant, G6PD B, the half-life of G6PD - is moderately reduced, whereas that of G6PD Mediterranean is more markedly abnormal. Because mature red cells do not synthesize new proteins, as red cells age G6PD - and G6PD Mediterranean enzyme activities quickly fall to levels that are inadequate to protect against oxidant stress. Thus, older red cells are much more prone to hemolysis than younger ones.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>G6PD deficiency Abnormalities in the hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt or glutathione metabolism resulting from deficient or impaired enzyme function reduce the ability of red cells to protect themselves against oxidative injuries and lead to hemolysis . G6PD deficiency is a recessive X-linked trait, placing males at much higher risk for symptomatic disease . G6PD mutations cause protein misfolding and breakdown , making it easier for red blood cells to break. As red blood cells age , the G6PD variants become less effective at protecting against oxidative stress , making older cells more likely to break than younger ones. The episodic hemolysis that is characteristic of G6PD deficiency is caused by exposures that generate oxidant stress. The most common triggers are infections, drugs implicated are numerous, including antimalarials (eg: primaquine and chloroquine), sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin , and others. The most frequently cited food is the fava bean, which generates oxidants when metabolized called \u201cFavism\u201d . When G6PD deficient RBCs are exposed to high levels of oxidants , reactive sulfhydryl groups on globin chains cross-link and form Heinz bodies , and dark inclusions are seen in stained red blood cells. These Heinz bodies can damage the red blood cell membrane and cause Intravascular hemolysis or reduced red blood cell flexibility . As the damaged cells pass through the spleen , macrophages remove the Heinz bodies , resulting in some cells retaining a \u2018bitten\u2019 appearance or becoming spherocytes due to loss of membrane surface area . Both types of damaged cells are then removed by phagocytes. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: effects of oxidant drug exposure (peripheral blood smear).

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>PNH The given scenario is suggestive of episodes of hemolysis since birth , so it is probably due to a hereditary cause . Out of the given Option:s, Hereditary Spherocytosis, Sickle cell disease & G6PD deficiency are inherited causes of hemolytic anemia , so they are usually present in early childhood. PNH is due to an acquired somatic mutation in the PIG-A gene , which usually presents in adults. So, PNH is the least likely diagnosis in this cause. REMEMBER: Sickle cell disease usually presents beyond 6 months of age, due to high HbF concentration before that, which prevents sickling.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a disease that results from acquired mutations in the phosphatidylinositol glycan complementation group A gene (PIGA), an enzyme that is essential for the synthesis of certain membrane-associated complement regulatory proteins. It is the only hemolytic anemia caused by an acquired genetic defect. PNH blood cells are deficient in three GPI-linked proteins that regulate complement activity: Decay-Accelerating Factor (DAF), or CD55 Membrane Inhibitor of Reactive Lysis (MIRL), or CD59 C8-binding protein Of these factors, the most important is CD59, a potent inhibitor of C3 convertase that prevents the spontaneous activation of the alternative complement pathway. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). (A) Flow cytogram of blood from a normal individual shows that the red cells express two phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG)-linked membrane proteins, CD55 and CD59, on their surfaces. (B) Flow cytogram of blood from a patient with PNH shows a population of red cells that is deficient in both CD55 and CD59. As is typical of PNH, a second population of CD55+/ CD59+ red cells that is derived from residual normal hematopoietic stem cells also is present. Red cells deficient in GPI-linked factors are abnormally susceptible to lysis or injury by complemen This manifests as intravascular hemolysis , which is caused by the C5b-C9 membrane attack complex . The tendency for red cells to lyse at night is explained by a slight decrease in blood pH during sleep, which increases the activity of complement. Thrombosis is the leading cause of disease-related death in individuals with PNH.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Hereditary spherocytosis. That could be the diagnosis. Option: B. Sickle cell disease. That could be the diagnosis. Option: D. G6PD deficiency. That could be the diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>About 5% to 10% of patients eventually develop acute myeloid leukemia or a myelodysplastic syndrome , indicating that PNH may arise in the context of genetic damage to hematopoietic stem cells. PNH is diagnosed by flow cytometry , which provides a sensitive means for detecting red cells that are deficient in GPI-linked proteins such as CD59. Eculizumab , a monoclonal antibody, effectively blocks complement activation in PNH by preventing the conversion of C5 to C5a. This inhibition reduces hemolysis, lowers transfusion needs, and decreases thrombosis risk by up to 90%.</p>\n<p></p>",
