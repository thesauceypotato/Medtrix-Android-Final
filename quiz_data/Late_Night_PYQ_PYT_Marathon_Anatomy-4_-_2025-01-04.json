Contralateral hemiplegia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The structure marked in the image is the pyramid containing the pyramidal tracts. A lesion here leads to contralateral hemiplegia.</li><li>\u2022 This is because the fibers of these tracts decussate (cross over) in the medulla oblongata. Thus, an injury to the pyramidal tract on one side of the brain or upper spinal cord will affect motor function on the opposite side of the body.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Ataxia : Ataxia refers to uncoordinated movement and is typically related to damage to the cerebellum or sensory pathways, not the pyramidal tracts. The cerebellum plays a crucial role in fine-tuning motor movements and ensuring coordination. So, an injury to the pyramidal tracts does not typically result in ataxia.</li><li>\u2022 Option B.</li><li>\u2022 Ataxia</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Tinnitus : Tinnitus is the perception of noise or ringing in the ears. It's a symptom of an underlying condition, such as age-related hearing loss, ear injury, or a circulatory system disorder. Injury to the pyramidal tracts would not lead to tinnitus, as they are primarily motor tracts and not involved in auditory processing or function.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.</li><li>\u2022 Tinnitus</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Ipsilateral facial palsy : Facial palsy refers to weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face. It is most commonly associated with damage to the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). While the pyramidal tracts do play a role in voluntary facial movements, a direct injury to these tracts would not typically lead to ipsilateral facial palsy. Furthermore, facial movements are controlled by both sides of the brain, so an isolated pyramidal tract lesion might not manifest as overt facial weakness.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.</li><li>\u2022 Ipsilateral facial palsy</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The pyramids in the medulla oblongata, containing the pyramidal tracts, are crucial for voluntary motor control. A lesion here can lead to contralateral hemiplegia due to the crossing over of these tracts within the medulla. This understanding is essential for diagnosing and understanding the implications of brainstem injuries, especially in the context of stroke or other neurological disorders.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

In the lumbar region, lordosis allows for an upright posture and helps to evenly distribute the body's weight and the forces exerted on the spine.

It's important to note that while scoliosis can affect the lumbar spine, it is not the normal anatomical curvature for that region.

Kyphosis:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Recurvatum: Recurvatum typically refers to a backward bending or hyperextension of a joint.

Correct : A blow to the pterion can be very dangerous because the middle meningeal artery runs just deep to this area, on the inner side of the skull.

Correct</li><li>\u2022 Option D. It corresponds to the site of the anterolateral fontanelle of the fetal skull.

This fontanelle usually closes a few months after birth.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.</li><li>\u2022 It corresponds to the site of the anterolateral fontanelle of the fetal skull.

The term \"pterion\" comes from the Greek word \"pteron,\" meaning \"wing,\" because the pterion is located at the point where the sphenoid bone and the temporal bone form a wing-like shape. The pterion is located just above the zygomatic arch and anterior to the ear. The middle meningeal artery, a branch of the maxillary artery, runs underneath the pterion and is at risk of injury in cases of head trauma.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
