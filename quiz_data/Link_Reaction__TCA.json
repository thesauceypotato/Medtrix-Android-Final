The cyclic AMP-independent PDH kinase phosphorylates and, thereby, inhibits E1, whereas PDH phosphatase dephosphorylates and activates E1. The kinase itself is allosterically activated by ATP, acetyl CoA, and NADH. Therefore, in the presence of these high-energy signals, the PDH complex is turned off. Pyruvate is a potent inhibitor of PDH kinase. Therefore, if pyruvate concentrations are elevated, E1 will be maximally active. Calcium is a strong activator of PDH phosphatase, stimulating E1 activity. This is particularly important in skeletal muscle, where the release of Ca2+ during contraction stimulates the PDH complex, thereby energy production. Although covalent regulation by the kinase and phosphatase is key, the complex is also subject to product (NADH, acetyl CoA) inhibition.</p>\n<p></p>",

PDC deficiency can be inherited as an autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive trait. Most cases of congenital lactic acidosis are caused by one or more inherited mutations of genes within the DNA located within the nucleus (nDNA) or within the mitochondria (mtDNA) of cells. Genes carry the genetic instructions for cells. A mutation is a change in a gene located in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA that may cause disease Mutations affecting the genes for mitochondria (mtDNA) are inherited from the mother. mtDNA that is found in sperm cells is typically lost during fertilization.
