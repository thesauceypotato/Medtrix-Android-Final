All three chains are synthesized in the liver, three structural genes involved are on the same chromosome, and their expression is co-ordinately regulated in humans. The amino terminal regions of the six chains are held in close proximity by a number of disulphide bonds, while the carboxy terminal regions are spread apart, giving rise to a highly asymmetric, elongated molecule. The A and B portions of the A\uf061 and B\uf062 chains, designated fibrinopeptides A and B, respectively, at the amino terminal ends of the chains, bear excess negative charges as a result of the presence of aspartate and glutamate residues, as well as unusual Tyrosine-O-sulphate in FPB. These negative charges contribute to the solubility offibrinogen in plasma and also serve to prevent aggregation by causing electrostatic repulsion between fibrinogen molecules.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>HGPRT (A more than C) Hyper galactosemia is associated with the following 3 enzyme deficiencies: 1. Galactokinase converts galactose togalactose-1-phosphate and is not a common deficiency. 2. Uridine diphosphate (UDP) galactose-4-epimerase epimerizes UDP galactose to UDP glucose and is also uncommon. 3. Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) is responsible for hereditary galactosemia and is the most common deficiency. This enzyme catalyzes conversion of galactose-1-phosphate and UDP glucose to UDP galactose and glucose-1-phosphate. Individuals with GALT deficiency manifest abnormal galactosetolerance. Hereditary galactosemia is among the most common carbohydrate metabolism disorders and can be a life- threatening illness during the new born period. Parents often complain to physicians about various feeding difficulties with their newborn, most notably, vomiting. Almost all infants on a lactose-containing diet manifest poor weight gain. Physical Examination: Untreated infants with severely deficient galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) activity typically present with the following variable findings: Poor growth with in the first few weeks of life Jaundice Bleeding from coagulopathy Liver dysfunction and/orhepatomegaly Cataracts (sometimes as early as the first few days of life) Lethargy Hypotonia Sepsis (E. coli) Seizures Brainedema Surprisingly, ascites may also be detected during early infancy. In some patients, ascites is detected as early   as the first few days of life. Surprisingly, ascites may also be detected during early infancy. In some patients, ascites is detected as early   as the first few days of life. In an infant or child with cataracts, galactosemia must be excluded. If unsure, consult an ophthalmologist because some cataracts,especially congenital cataracts,are visible only by using as litlamp. Vitreous hemorrhage is a known complication of galactosemia, although its prevalence is unknown. An enigmatic linkage of E. coli sepsis with galactosemia is noted. Galactosemia should be high on the differential diagnosis of term infants with sepsis caused by infection with this pathogen. Learning problems and speech and language deficits are common;language acquisition may be delayed. The most common findings in adults include hypergonadotropic hypogonadism or primaryovarian insufficiency in women, although some women have become pregnant, most notably blacks who probably have variant disease, but also white women with classic galactosemia. Short stature and neurologic abnormalities (e.g. tremor, ataxia, dystonia) also occur in a minority of patients.</p>\n<p></p>",

Biology of Phenylketonuria Phenylketonuria or PKU is the inability of the body to Metabolize pheynlamine. Phenylaline builds to toxic levels in the tissues, particularly damaging the nervous system. PKU is a chronic disease, but it is possible to greatly reduce the probability of further damage by following a strict low-protein diet PKU is autosomal recessive and carried on chromosome 1 2 Symptoms: Often have lighter skin, hair, and eyes than brothers or sisters without the disease. Other symptoms include: Eczema Recurrent vomiting Jerking movements in arms and legs Tremors & Mood disorders, Microcephaly A birth defect that causes an amino acid called phenylalanine to build up in the body. PKU is an autosomal recessive metabolic genetic disorder. PKU is characterized by homozygous or compound heterozygousmutations in the gene for the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). rendering it nonfunctional. This enzyme is necessary to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) to the amino acid tyrosine (Tyr). When PAH activity is reduced, phenylalanine accumulates and is converted into phenylpyruvate (phenylketone), which can be detected in the urine. PAH gene is located on chromosome 12 in the bands 12q22-q24.1. More than 400 disease-causing mutations have been found in the PAH gene.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Choline Fish odor syndrome, more correctly known asTrimethylaminuria, is a metabolic disorder first described in1970.It is characterized by abnormal excretion of trimethylamine in the urine, breath, sweat and vaginal secretions. It may be primary in origin or secondary to liver or kidney damage, or it may becaused by an increase in the precursors of trimethylamine, such as choline,lecithinor carnitine in the diet. The primary syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The defective enzyme is Flavin-containing monooxygenase 3, the gene for which (FMO3) is located in chromosome region 1q23\u201325. Trimethylamine is derived from the intestinal bacterial degradation of foods rich incholine, lecithin and carnitine. Trimethylamine produced within the intestinal tract is rapidly absorbed and is converted within the liver, by the action of Flavin-containing monooxygenase 3, to trimethylamine N-oxide, which is then excreted in the urine. Affected individuals have a reduced capacity to metabolize trimethylamine into trimethylamine N-oxide. Excessive amounts of the volatile molecule are therefore excreted in the body fluids,which give off a strong fishy smell. The biochemical diagnosis is established by measuring the ratio of trimethylamine N-oxide to trimethylamine in the urine. Among people without Trimethylaminuria, more than 97% of excretion occurs as trimethylamine N-oxide. In patients with the condition,theratiois reduced. Treatment includes counselling and dietary modifications. An explanation of the biochemical nature of the disorder and the exacerbating factors such as menstruation may assist in relieving patients\u2019 anxiety. Behavioral counseling may help with depression and other psychological symptoms. Genetic counseling should be considered if the patient has the primary form of the syndrome. Dietary adjustments include avoidance of choline-rich foods such as egg yolk, liver, kidney, peas, soybeans and seafish. Expert opinion suggests that a short course of low-dose neo- mycin or metronidazole can be used to suppress production   of trimethylamine in the gut. The use of mildly acidic soaps may help to reduce the odor in some patients. Flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 is known to be involved   in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate\u2013depend- ent oxidation and metabolism of a number of drugs such as tamoxifen, ketoconazole, Sulindac sulphide and benzydamine. Given this involvement, case reports of exacerbation of fish odor syndrome in association with these drugs and other medications might be expected, because patients with primary tri- methyl aminuria may have a reduced ability to metabolize these compounds. However, restricting dietary choline can have important repercussions. Choline deficiency may result in hepatocellular injury, neurological disease, and even a predisposition to cancer. Notably, pregnant women have an increased choline require- ment so restricting intake may be even less desirable in this demographic.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase Type 1 tyrosinemia also known as hepatorenal tyrosinemia or tyrosinosis the most severe form of tyrosinemia, is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme fumarylace to acetatehydrolase. Type 1 tyrosinemia typically presents in the infancy as failure to thrive and hepatomegaly. The primary effects are progressive liver and kidney dysfunction. The liver disease causes cirrhosis, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, elevated AFP, hypoglycemia and coagulation abnormalities. This can lead to jaundice, ascites and hemorrhage. There is also an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The kidney dysfunction presents as Fanconi syndrome: Renal tubular acidosis, hypophosphatemia and aminoaciduria. Cardiomyopathy, neurologic and dermato- logic manifestations are also possible. The urine has an odor of boiled cabbage or rancid butter. Type 1 tyrosinemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Pathophysiology: Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase catalyses the final step in the degradation of tyrosine-fumarylacetoacetate   to fumarate, acetoacetate and succinate. Fumarylacetoacetate accumulates in hepatocytes and proximal renal tubal cells and causes oxidative damage and DNA damage leading to cell death and dys functional gene expression which alters metabolic processes like protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis. The increase in fumarylacetoacetate inhibits previous steps in tyrosine degradation leading to an accumulation of tyrosine in the body. Tyrosine is not directly toxic to the liver or kidneys but causes dermatologic and neuro developmental problems. The primary treatment for type 1 tyrosinemia is Nitisinone (Orfadin) (also used for the treatment of alkaptonuria) and restriction of tyrosine in the diet. Nitisinone inhibits the conversion of 4-OH-phenylpyruvate to Homogentisic acid by 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, the second step in tyrosine degradation. By inhibiting this enzyme, the accumulation of the fumarylacetoacetate is prevented. Previously, liver transplantation was the primary treatment option and is still used in patients in whom Nitisinone fails.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Secondary active transport In many situation, the active transport of Na+ is coupled to the transport of other substances (secondary active transport). For example, the luminal membranes of mucosal cells in the small intestine contains a symport that transports glucose into the cell only if Na+ binds to the protein and is transported into the cell at the same time. From the cells the about 24% of the energy utilized by cells, and in neurons it accounts for 70%. Thus, it accounts    for a large part of the basal metabolism. A major payoff for this energy use is the establishment of the electrochemical gradient   in cells.</p>\n<p></p>",
