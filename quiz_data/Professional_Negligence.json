Ordinarily, the professional negligence of a physician must be proved in Court by the expert evidence of another physician.

The patient has to merely state what according to him the act of negligence was. Conditions to be satisfied: That in the absence of negligence the injury would not have occurred ordinarily; That the doctor had exclusive control over the injury-producing instrument or treatment; That the patient was not guilty of contributory negligence. This enables the patient's lawyer to prove his case without medical evidence. Examples: Prescribing an overdose of the medicine produces ill effects. Giving poisonous medicine carelessly. Failure to give anti-tetanic serum in cases of injury causing tetanus. Bums from the application of hot water bottles or from X-ray therapy. Breaking of needles.

Hospitals have an independent duty to their patients to investigate the adequacy and review the competence of staff physicians, This theory is based on the principle that hospitals are in a far better position than their patients to supervise a physician's performance and provide quality control. This legal theory has been used to attack the allegedly negligent selection, retention, or supervision of its participating physicians, which is negligent credentialing. It is the failure of those persons who are responsible for providing the accommodation, facilities, and treatment to follow the established standard of conduct.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Options: A, B, & C. It occurs when the hospital provides defective equipment or drugs, selects or retains incompetent employees, or fails in some other manner to meet the accepted standard of care, and such failure results in injury to a patient to whom the hospital owes a duty. In the corporate sector (hospital, nursing home, etc.)., where more than one person at more than one level fails to render appropriate service to the patient, may result in some damage to the patient.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Last clear chance doctrine LAST CLEAR CHANCE DOCTRINE : If the doctor fails to prevent damage resulting from the negligent act of the patient, even after getting clear time, he cannot plead contributory negligence in civil cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options :- Option: A. Res judicata (S. 300, Cr.P.C.). If a question of negligence against a doctor has already been decided by a Court in a dispute between the doctor and his patient. The patient will not be allowed to contest the same question in another proceeding between himself and the doctor on the same set of facts. Only appeals can be made. Option: C. Res ipsa Loquitur : A doctrine or rule of evidence in a civil negligence case that permits an inference or presumption that the doctor was negligent in an accident injuring the patient on the basis of circumstantial evidence if the accident was of a kind that does not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence. Option: D. 'NOVUS ACTUS INTERVENIENS: (Breaking the chain): It refers to the idea that causal connections are deemed to finish. Even if the doctor can be shown to have acted negligently, there will be no liability if some new intervening act breaks the chain of causation between that negligence and the loss or damage sustained by the patient.</p>\n<p></p>",
