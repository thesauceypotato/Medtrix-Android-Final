Stapedial artery hemorrhage has been found to be the genetic basis by experiments in animals. Option B. Treacher Collin syndrome Mandibulofacial dysostosis also known as treacher Collins syndrome due to the involvement of first and second arch components of the cranial neural crest, is characterized by incomplete orbits, reduced jaw, conductive hearing loss, external and middle ear fistula, and results due to mutations in the TCOF1 gene Option C. Craniofrontonasal syndrome Deletion of the EFNB1 gene leads to craniofrontonasal syndrome. It is characterized by a broad forehead, hypertelorism, central nasal groove, premature fusion of coronal sutures and is occasionally associated with cleft lip, and cleft palate. This dysmorphic anomaly of face and palate can occur due to defective embryonic development. Option D.
