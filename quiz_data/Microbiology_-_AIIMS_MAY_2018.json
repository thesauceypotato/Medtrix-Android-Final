Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococci) is inhibited by the small amount of bacitracin in the disk; other beta-hemolytic streptococci usually are not. Some laboratories do not recommend the use of 0.04 U bacitracin disk as Lancefield Group C and G streptococci may occasionally also show susceptibility to bacitracin. PYR reaction can confirm the isolate as S. pyogenes as it is the only beta-hemolytic streptococci that gives positive PYR reaction. Expected results of Bacitracin test: Sensitive: Any zone of inhibition around the disk Resistant: No zone of inhibition Quality control organisms used in Bacitracin test: Test for identifying Streptococcus pyogenes.

At the completion of the sterilization process based on this technology, no toxic residues remain on the sterilized items. The technology is particularly suited to the sterilization of heat and moisture sensitive instruments since process temperatures do not exceed about 50\u00b0C (140\u00b0F) and sterilization occurs in a low moisture environment. Total process time is about 1 hour. The efficacy of the process has been demonstrated against a broad spectrum or microorganisms and on a large number of substrates used in medical instruments. The Sterrad system offers a short cycle (averaging 75 minutes), low temperature and humidity, no aeration requirement, no chemical residues, negligible environmental impact, and wide compatibility with materials. Its drawback is an inability to process liquids, powders, or strong absorbers (e.g., cellulosic)</p>\n<p></p>",

Rate of pneumonia in pediatric intensive care units (PICU) is lower than in adult intensive care units (ICU). In neonates, the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia is inversely proportional to birth weight. Children with artificial airways, such as a tracheostomy tube for management of chronic respiratory failure or an endotracheal tube for acute airway management, are at risk for VAP. It is difficult to diagnose VAP. They have classified it into three types: Clinically defined, Pneumonia with laboratory findings, and Pneumonia in immune-compromised patients. Note: Infants and children are usually classified to the first category. Tracheitis Clinical signs of purulent tracheal discharge, fevers, respiratory distress, and the presence of bacteria and white blood cells in the tracheal aspirate without radiological signs of pneumonia. VAP Clinical signs of purulent tracheal discharge, fevers, respiratory distress, and micro-biological signs of the presence of microorganisms along with white blood cells in the tracheal aspirate along with radiological evidence of pneumonia. VAP is typically bacterial and from a single organism. However, polymicrobial infections are increasing. MC organisms are Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram negatives. Artificial airways become colonized with pathogenic bacteria soon after intubation or tracheostomy, and the major pathogens include both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: S. aureus (including MRSA), aeruginosa, and Klebsiella and Enterobacter species. Patients in an NICU have a risk of Enterococcus species and Group B Streptococcus as well. Other pathogens include the Streptococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Acinetobacter species. Anaerobic bacteria are an uncommon cause of ventilator-associated pneumonia but can play a role in polymicrobial infections, particularly when pneumonia is due to aspiration. Nosocomial viruses and fungi are rare causes of pneumonia in immunocompetent hosts. Early pneumonia \u2022  Less than 4 days after admission to the hospital \u2022  Due to antibiotic-sensitive community-acquired organisms Late pneumonia \u2022  More than 4 days \u2022  Due to antibiotic-resistant organisms. Study from AIIMS Surgical Department and ICUs shows that the Acinetobacter is nowadays the most common and most specific cause for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).</p>\n<p></p>",

Whereas in the other 3 conditions, the estimation of viral load is an important part of the management of the diseases and helps predict the response to the treatment.</p>\n<p></p>",
