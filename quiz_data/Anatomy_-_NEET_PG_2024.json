Option: B. Mucosa of the nasal cavity The nasal mucosa detects sensations in the nose through a complex system of nerves and sensory structures: Olfactory Nerve Responsible for the sense of smell, the olfactory nerve is one of the main interpreters of chemosensory information. The olfactory mucosa, a specialized part of the nasal mucosa, contains receptors for smell. Trigeminal Nerve The ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve provide sensory innervation to the nasal mucosa. When activated, these nerves can cause sensations of pain or irritation, which can lead to sneezing. Option: D.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Obturator Nerve The adductor portion of the adductor magnus is innervated by the posterior division of the obturator nerve (L2-L4). The adductor magnus hamstring portion is so named due to its similarity in structure, proximal attachment, and innervation to the hamstring muscles.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The adductor magnus muscle is innervated by two nerves: Obturator nerve- The posterior division of the obturator nerve supplies the adductor portion of the muscle. The obturator nerve originates from the L2 to L4 nerve roots of the lumbar plexus. Tibial division of the sciatic nerve- The tibial division of the sciatic nerve supplies the hamstring portion of the muscle.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option: A. Common peroneal nerve The common peroneal nerve innervates the short head of the biceps femoris muscle. Option: B. Tibial nerve The tibial nerve innervates the semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and long head of the biceps femoris muscles. The common peroneal branch of the sciatic nerve innervates the short head of the biceps femoris. Option: C. Femoral nerve The femoral nerve innervates the following muscles: Quadriceps femoris : This group of muscles, which includes the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and vastus intermedius, extends the leg at the knee joint. The rectus femoris also helps to steady the hip joint and flex the thigh. Iliacus : This hip flexor muscle is innervated by the femoral nerve. Pectineus : This muscle is innervated by the femoral nerve. Sartorius : This knee extensor muscle is innervated by the femoral nerve.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Lower limb muscles with dual nerve supply Muscle Nerves Adductor magnus Adductor part - posterior division of obturator nerve Hamstring part -tibial part of sciatic nerve.
