This process starts with the mitotic division of the stem cells located close to the basement membrane of the tubules. The spermatogonium undergoes mitotic division to form two primary spermatocytes (largest germ cells). The primary spermatocytes undergo first meiotic division (reduction division) to form two secondary spermatocytes. The secondary spermatocytes thus have a haploid number of chromosomes. Each secondary spermatocyte immediately undergoes second meiotic division (i.e., mitotic division) to form two spermatids, each with haploid number of chromosomes. Each spermatid gradually changes its stage to become spermatozoa or sperm. This transformation of circular spermatid into an elongated spermatozoon is called spermiogenesis. Thus from one primary spermatocyte four spermatozoa are formed; two with 22 autosomes and one X chromosome (22 + X, 22 + X) and two with 22 autosomes and one Y chromosome (22 + Y, 22 + Y).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Spermatogenesis</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- The sequence of formation of cells in spermatogenesis is as follows: Spermatogonia \u2192 Primary spermatocytes \u2192 Secondary spermatocytes \u2192 Spermatids \u2192 Sperms.

The Couinaud classification of liver anatomy divides the liver into eight functionally independent segments. Each segment has its own vascular inflow, outflow and biliary drainage. In the centre of each segment there is a branch of the portal vein, hepatic artery and bile duct. Functional liver segment</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The liver is divided into right and left anatomical lobes by the attachment of the falciform ligament anteriorly and superiorly; by the fissure for the ligamentum teres inferiorly; and by the fissure for the ligamentum venosum posteriorly .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- The structure that divides the liver in Couinaud\u2019s classification system is the portal vein, therefore option B, C and D are incorrect answers.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The liver occupies the whole of the right hypochondrium, the greater part of the epigastrium, and extends into the left hypochondrium reaching up to the left lateral line. From the above, it will be obvious that most of the liver is covered by ribs and costal cartilages, except in the upper part of the epigastrium where it is in contact with the anterior abdominal Wall.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Middle finger The Middle Finger has two dorsal interossei. The four dorsal interossei muscles are bipennate in nature First two attach to radial side of proximal phalanx of index and middle finger & blend with dorsal digital expansion The third & fourth to ulnar side of the proximal phalanx of middle and ring finger & blend with dorsal digital expansion. Second and third are attached to the radial & ulnar sides of the middle finger. Dorsal Interossei causes Abduction of fingers from the Middle/3rd finger.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The palmar interossei are a group of paired intrinsic muscles of the hand located between the metacarpals. They consist of four, and sometimes three, palmar muscles that adduct fingers. The palmar interossei also assists in flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints and extension of the interphalangeal joints.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- The Middle Finger has two dorsal interossei, therefore Option A, B and D are incorrect answers.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Functions of the lumbricals include flexion at the respective metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint and extension at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. Interestingly, the lumbricals arise from their partial antagonist, the flexor digitorum profundus.</p>\n<p></p>",
