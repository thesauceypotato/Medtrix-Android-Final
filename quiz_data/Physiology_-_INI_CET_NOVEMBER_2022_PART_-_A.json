Excessive distention or irritation of the duodenum provides a strong stimulus for vomiting. Area postrema constitutes the vomiting centre. In the early stage, reverse peristalsis begins often minutes before vomiting. It begins far down in the ileum and travels up the intestine. This process pushes a large share of lower small intestine contents to the duodenum and stomach. Relaxation of the pyloric sphincter occurs during this process. At the onset of vomiting, strong intrinsic contractions are seen in the duodenum and stomach. Once the vomiting centre has been stimulated, inspiration occurs against the closed glottis. It prevents the flow of vomitus into the lungs. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is open and the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) is closed at this stage. The muscles of the abdominal wall contract, building intra-gastric pressure. Finally LES relaxes completely and US also relaxes allowing the expulsion of the gastric contents.</p>\n<p></p>",

It involves injecting a known volume of cold saline into the bloodstream and measuring the change in temperature as it mixes with the blood. By analyzing the temperature change, cardiac output can be determined. d) Fick's Principle: Fick's principle is a method based on the principle of conservation of mass. It involves measuring the difference in oxygen content between arterial and venous blood, along with oxygen consumption. Cardiac output can be calculated by dividing the oxygen consumption by the arteriovenous oxygen difference.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Myoglobin The curve 'A' shows a hyperbolic curve that is characteristic of oxygen dissociation in myoglobin . Myoglobin is an iron-containing component of the skeletal muscle. Myoglobin can bind only to one oxygen molecule and hence lacks cooperative binding. It has a higher affinity to oxygen than hemoglobin and hence releases oxygen only at low PO2 values. This leads to a leftward shift in the myoglobin oxygen dissociation curve.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The oxygen\u2013hemoglobin dissociation curve, also called the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve or oxygen dissociation curve (ODC), is a curve that plots the proportion of hemoglobin in its saturated (oxygen-laden) form on the vertical axis against the prevailing oxygen tension on the horizontal axis.

CO Poisoning :- Carbon monoxide (CO) reacts with hemoglobin to form carbon monoxyhemoglobin (carboxyhemoglobin or COHb). The affinity of hemoglobin for CO is 210 times its affinity for 02, and COb liberates CO very slowly. An additional difficulty is that when COHb is present, the dissociation curve of the remaining Hb02 shifts to the left, decreasing the amount of 02 released. Option: D.

Decreases ATP production and breaks the link between globin chains: This option is not correct because 2,3-BPG does not directly affect ATP production or break the link between globin chains. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the energy currency of cells and is not directly influenced by 2,3-BPG. Additionally, the link between globin chains in hemoglobin is primarily stabilized by covalent bonds and does not involve the action of 2,3-BPG. Option: B. It increases ATP production: This option is not correct because 2,3-BPG does not increase ATP production. ATP is generated through cellular processes such as glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, or other metabolic pathways. 2,3-BPG is actually produced as a byproduct of glycolysis and serves as an allosteric regulator of hemoglobin, affecting its oxygen-binding affinity, but it does not have a direct role in ATP synthesis. Option: D. Inhibit Taut state: This option is not correct because 2,3-BPG does not inhibit the Taut (taut state) of hemoglobin. The Taut state refers to the low-affinity state of hemoglobin where it has a reduced ability to bind oxygen. In fact, 2,3-BPG binds to hemoglobin and stabilizes the Taut state, leading to the release of oxygen from hemoglobin. This stabilization of the Taut state by 2,3-BPG is essential for efficient oxygen delivery to tissues.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Transmembrane proteins are integral proteins that span across the plasma/ endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. They are classified into types 1 to 4. Type 1 membrane proteins have a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence outside the cell, a transmembrane sequence that is usually situated close to the C-terminus and the C-terminus facing inside the cell, e.g., low-density lipoprotein receptor. Type 2 membrane proteins have the -terminal towards the cytosol and the C-terminal towards the exterior, e.g., transferrin receptor. Type 3 membrane proteins are identical to type 1 but have a shorter N terminal, e.g., cytochrome P450 enzyme complexes. Type 4 membrane proteins consist of 7 alpha helices traversing the membrane, e.g., glucose transporters and G-protein-coupled receptors.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for other options: - Option B: At the C-terminal This option is incorrect because the C-terminal region of a type 2 membrane protein typically faces the extracellular space or lumen of a cellular compartment. Option C: Both inside the membrane and at the C-terminal This option is incorrect because the signaling sequence is not typically located at both inside the membrane and at the C-terminal region.

Option D: The signalling sequence in a type 2 membrane protein is located inside the membrane not At the N- terminal.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Generally, the N-terminal that is synthesized first in a ribosome acts as the signal peptide to target the protein to move across the ER membrane. The internalized peptide is cleaved by the signal peptidase within the cell. This leads to the separation of the N-terminal from the protein, and only the protein enters the cytosol/interior. But a membrane protein must be retained within the membrane and is not translocated into the interior. So, in type 1 transmembrane proteins, the protein is retained within the membrane after the N-terminal is cleaved. This is facilitated by the stop-transfer sequence. All the other membrane proteins (types 2, 3, and 4) lack the N-terminal signal sequence. Instead, they have an internal sequence that is uncleaved and has a center cluster of hydrophobic amino acids. This uncleaved signalling sequence is retained inside the membrane.</p>\n<p></p>",
