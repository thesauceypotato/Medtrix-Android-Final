It may be detected within a few days of the death of the fetus, but often takes much longer time, sometimes even two to three weeks.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The lung margins are sharp If the baby died in utero and no signs of live birth were present at delivery, then the margins of the lung are sharp, which become rounded even when the breathing is feeble. In a minimally respired lung, the anterior margin shows partial expansion; the lingula, anterior or diaphragmatic margin, and medial edge of the lower lobe are sometimes pinker and more expanded than the posterior parts. Glistening bullae appear along the margins when there has been a struggle to breathe due to some mechanical obstruction.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. The Position of the Diaphragm: The abdomen should be opened before the thorax, and the highest point of the diaphragm is noted, which is found about the level of the fourth or fifth rib if respiration has not taken place, and at the level of the sixth or seventh rib after breathing. The position is affected by gases of decomposition. Option: B. The shape of the Chest: Before respiration, the chest is flat and its circumference is one to two cm. less than the abdomen at the level of the umbilicus. After respiration, the chest expands and becomes arched or drum-shaped. Option: C. Changes in the Stomach and Intestines: - Air is swallowed into the stomach during respiration. Hence, the stomach and intestines are removed after tying double ligatures at each end. They float in water if respiration has taken place, otherwise, they sink. This is known as Breslau's second life test or stomach-bowel test. This test is not of much value because air may be swallowed by the child in attempting to free the air passages of fluid obstructions in cases of stillbirth. It is useless when there is decomposition. In a stillborn child or one dying shortly after birth. The stomach will contain grey-white gastric mucin mixed with swallowed amniotic fluid. Sometimes, the infant may swallow maternal blood during delivery. When dissected underwater, the stomach shows mucus, saliva, and air bubbles if respiration has taken place, and only mucus if breathing has not occurred. Blood, meconium, or liquor amnii in the stomach indicates that the child was alive at or shortly before birth. If milk is present in the stomach, it is positive evidence that the child has lived for some time after birth.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Residual air The hydrostatic test is done in a case of infanticide and is based on the principle that the specific gravity of the unrespired lungs varies from 1.04 to 1.05 and that of respired lungs is 0.94, because of an increase in volume due to inhalation of air. The fetal lungs, therefore, sink in water and those that have respired float. Remove the lungs as far as the trachea along with the larynx by tying at the laryngeal end and placing them in a jar of water and note for their floatation. The lungs are then separated and each is tested separately for the presence or absence of floatation. Finally, each lung is then cut into fragments that are again tested for floatation. If in all such events, floatation is present the test is positive (provided putrefaction is absent). If they continue to float even after this compression due to the presence of residual air, the test is positive and respiration has taken place. If some of the pieces sink and some float, it shows feeble respiration owing to the partial penetration of the air.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. If there is some decomposition, then the fragments should be compressed to remove the tidal air. The fragments are again placed in water.) Option: C & D.
