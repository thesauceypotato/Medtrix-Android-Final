      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>TGF- \u03b2 causes endothelial proliferation and migration along with suppression of ECM protein Angiogenesis is the process of new blood vessel development from existing vessels . It is critical in healing at sites of injury , in the development of collateral circulations at sites of ischemia , and in allowing tumours to increase in size beyond the constraints of their original blood supply. Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), mainly VEGF-A , stimulate both migration and proliferation of endothelial cells , thus initiating the process of capillary sprouting in angiogenesis. Angiopoietins 1 and 2 (Ang 1 and Ang 2) are growth factors that play a role in angiogenesis and the structural maturation of new vessels . The growth factors PDGF and TGF-\u03b2 also participate in stabilisation: PDGF recruits smooth muscle cells, and TGF-\u03b2 suppresses endothelial proliferation and migration and enhances the production of ECM proteins .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Angiogenesis in tumor cells: Even if a solid tumor possesses all the genetic aberrations required for malignant transformation, it cannot enlarge beyond 1 to 2 mm in diameter unless it can induce angiogenesis . Angiogenesis is controlled by a balance between angiogenesis promoters and inhibitors ; in angiogenic tumors this balance is skewed in favor of promoters. Hypoxia triggers angiogenesis through the actions of HIF1\u03b1 on the transcription of the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF . Many other factors regulate angiogenesis, e.g., p53 induces synthesis of the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1 , while RAS, MYC, and MAPK signalling all upregulate VEGF expression and stimulate angiogenesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. VEGF stimulates both migration and proliferation of endothelial cells. True . Option: B. Angiopoietin 1&2 play your role in angiogenesis and structural maturation of new vessels. True . Option: C. PDGF recruits smooth muscle cells. True .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The idea that angiogenesis is essential for solid tumors to grow to clinically significant sizes has helped develop new treatment modalities against cancer. A cardinal example is bevacizumab , a monoclonal antibody that neutralises VEGF activity and is approved for treating multiple cancers but is not curative .</p>\n<p></p>",
