Log phase \u2013 The log phase, or the exponential or logarithmic phase, is one of the phases observed in a bacterial growth curve.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>0.5 The resolving power of the light microscope under ideal conditions is about half the wavelength of the light being used. Resolving power is the distance that must separate two point light sources to be seen as two different images. With yellow light of a wavelength of 0.4 \u03bcm, the minor separable diameters are thus about 0.2 \u03bcm (i.e., one-third the width of a typical prokaryotic cell). The useful magnification of a microscope is the magnification that makes visible the smallest resolvable particles. The resolving power of a microscope depends upon the wavelength of illumination and numerical aperture of the objective lens. Resolving Power of microscope = 2 n sin \u03b8 \u03bb, where the wavelength is the refractive index of the medium separating object, and the aperture is the angular separation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options B, C, D.
