A) Golgi Bodies</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The Golgi apparatus (Golgi bodies) functions as the primary sorting and distribution center for cellular proteins. After proteins are synthesized by ribosomes and processed in the endoplasmic reticulum, they are transported to the Golgi apparatus where they undergo further modifications like glycosylation. The Golgi then packages proteins into transport vesicles and directs them to their appropriate destinations within or outside the cell based on specific sorting signals. Localization sequences within proteins serve as molecular \"zip codes\" that the Golgi recognizes to ensure proper targeting to destinations such as the plasma membrane, lysosomes, or for secretion.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Hormone sensitive lipase is a catabolic enzyme present in adipose tissue cells which causes release of fatty acids from stored TG during starvation. So, it is activated by catabolic enzyme Glucagon. Lipoprotein lipase on the other hand is an anabolic enzyme and release FA from TG of VLDL and chylomicrons in fed state. Understanding the regulatory role of insulin in lipase enzymes is essential for medical students. Insulin inhibits hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) to promote fat storage and activates lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to facilitate fatty acid uptake, which helps maintain energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism in the body.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref- Harper 31 st e/p 240, 245</li><li>\u27a4 Ref- Harper 31 st e/p 240, 245</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

They are formed from arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid has (20 C, 4=) and is synthesized from linoleic acid. Eicosanoids (Prostaglandins and leukotrienes) are synthesized from arachidonic acid. So, Linoleic acid is considered as most essential fatty acid.</li><li>\u27a4 Extra Information on PUFAs</li><li>\u27a4 Extra Information on PUFAs</li></ul>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p><ul><li>\u21b3 Reference: Harper\u2019s 31 st ed/pg- 224</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

A) Telomerase</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that maintains the length of telomeres by adding repetitive nucleotide sequences to the ends of chromosomes. This action prevents telomeres from reaching a critically short length, which would trigger cellular senescence or apoptosis. Telomerase is particularly active in stem cells and most cancer cells, enabling them to divide indefinitely. In most somatic cells, however, telomerase activity is low or absent, leading to eventual senescence.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.
