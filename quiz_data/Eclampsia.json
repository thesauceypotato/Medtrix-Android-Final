Calcium supplementation (2 g/day) reduces the risk of gestational hypertension. Point 2. Regular antenatal check up for early detection of rapid gain in weight or a tendency of rising blood pressure especially the diastolic one. Point 3. Antithrombotic agents: Low-dose aspirin 60 mg daily beginning early in pregnancy in potentially high risk patients is given. It selectively reduces platelet thromboxane production. Aspirin in low doses is known to inhibit cyclooxygenase in platelets thereby preventing the formation of thromboxane A2 without interfering with prostacyclin generation. Point 4. Antioxidants, vitamins E and C and nutritional supplementation with magnesium, zinc, fish oil and low-salt diet have been tried but are of limited benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Also - Heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin is useful in women with thrombophilia and with high risk pregnancy.

Point 4) is a false statement. Water and electrolyte balance: The consensus of opinion is varying degree of salt retention. The precise mechanism is not clear. It is not due to increase in aldosterone which, in fact, is diminished in preeclampsia. The retention is likely due to renal vasoconstriction leading to reduction of GFR. The salt retention increases extracellular fluid volume; increases sensitivity to angiotensin-II and may increase peripheral resistance by causing arteriolar endothelial swelling. The net effect is intravascular dehydration and extravascular over hydration. Thus, there is hemoconcentration and rise in hematocrit value. Immediately following delivery, there is rapid mobilization of sodium and water from the extravascular compartment into the intravascular space. If this mechanism fails, the patient may develop shock (Postpartum vascular collapse).</p>\n<p></p>",

This, generally results in opening up of collateral circulation by means of paravertebral and azygous veins. In some cases (10%) when the collateral circulation fails to open, the venous return of the heart may be seriously curtailed which results in production of hypotension, tachycardia and syncope . Normal blood pressure is quickly restored by turning the patient to lateral position.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>DVT Severe complications of Preeclampsia: Pulmonary edema It is a common complication of severe preeclampsia and eclampsia affecting ~3% of patients. Most cases are a result of aggressive use of crystalloid solutions, for intravascular volume expansion It usually occurs in the post partum period and is characterized by profound respiratory distress, severe hypoxemia and diffuse rales . Treatment: Administering oxygen by nasal prongs. Restriction of I/V or oral fluids. Furosemide 20-40 mg l/v every 6 hours. Acute renal Failure: Oliguria is common in patients with severe preeclampsia It is mostly prerenal in origin. Intracranial bleeding : It is the leading cause of death in preeclampsia . It is seen that main connection of this event is with systolic BP and not with diastolic B/P. Visual disorder: Blindness may occur in patients with severe preeclampsia and eclampsia and may persist for several days, although quick recovery after delivery is the rule. NOTE :As far as DVT is concerned \u2013 I know some of you may think that DIC is a result of preeclampsia which in turn can lead to DVT \u2013 But \u2013 DIC is a complication of eclampsia and HELLP syndrome, perse preeclampsia does not lead to DIC.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1=d, 2=a, 3=b, 4=c In preeclampsia: There is an imbalance in different components of prostaglandins\u2014relative or absolute deficiency of vasodilator prostaglandin (PGI2) from vascular endothelium and increased synthesis of thromboxane (TXA2), a potent vasoconstrictor in platelets. There is increased vascular sensitivity to the pressor agent angiotensin-II. Angiotensinase activity is depressed, following proteinuria with elimination of alpha2 globulin (see scheme for pathophysiology). Nitric oxide: It is synthesized in the vascular endothelium and syncytiotrophoblast from L-arginine. It significantly relaxes vascular smooth muscle, inhibits platelet aggregation and prevents intervillous thrombosis. Deficiency of nitric oxide contributes to the development of hypertension . Endothelin-1 is synthesized by endothelial cells, and it is a potent vasoconstrictor compared to angiotensin-II. Endothelin-1 also contributes to the cause of hypertension. Inflammatory mediators: Cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interleukins (IL-6) and others] derived from activated leukocytes cause endothelial injury Abnormal lipid metabolism\u2014results in more oxidative stress . Lipid peroxides, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide anion radicals \u2014 cause endothelial injury and dysfunction. Platelet and neutrophil activation, cytokines, superoxide radical production and endothelial damage are in a vicious cycle. Imbalance of angiogenic and antiangiogenic proteins in placental vascular bed\u2014there is overproduction of two antiangiogenic factors from the trophoblastic tissue. These two antiangiogenic factors are: (a) soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase I (SFlt-1) and (b) soluble endoglin. SFlt-1 binds with VEGF and placental-like growth factor (PLGF) and causes endothelial cell dysfunction. Others\u2014 mutation of factor V Leiden increases the risk. NOTE:Hence preeclampsia is characterized by endothelial dysfunction and vasospasm. Endothelial dysfunction is due to oxidative stress and the inflammatory mediators. Vasospasm results from the imbalance of vasodilators (PGI2, NO) and vasoconstrictors (Angiotensin-II, TXA2, Endothelin-1).
