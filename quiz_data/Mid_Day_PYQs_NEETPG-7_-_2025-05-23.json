These clinical features are suggestive of advanced cervical cancer. The involvement of the lateral parametrium indicates that the cancer has spread beyond the cervix to the surrounding tissues but not to the pelvic wall or the lower third of the vagina, which classifies it as Stage 2B cervical cancer. The standard treatment for Stage 2B cervical cancer is chemoradiation, which combines chemotherapy with radiation therapy. This approach aims to enhance the effectiveness of the treatment, reduce tumor size, and prevent further spread of the cancer.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy alone is not the standard treatment for Stage 2B cervical cancer. It may be used in conjunction with radiation, but not as a sole therapy in this stage.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Chemotherapy:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Brachytherapy: Brachytherapy, a form of internal radiation therapy, is typically used for early-stage cervical cancer or in combination with external beam radiation therapy for more advanced stages. However, it is not sufficient as a standalone treatment for Stage 2B.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Brachytherapy:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Surgery: Surgery is generally not recommended for Stage 2B cervical cancer due to the extent of the disease spread to the parametrium. The preferred approach is chemoradiation to address both local and regional disease.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

D) Cochlear implants increase tinnitus in patients who had tinnitus before implantation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Cochlear implants do not increase tinnitus in patients who had tinnitus before implantation. In fact, the opposite is true - cochlear implants often help reduce tinnitus in most patients who experience it prior to implantation. The electrical stimulation provided by the implant can mask or suppress the tinnitus sensation. Studies show that cochlear implantation can reduce or even eliminate pre-existing tinnitus in approximately 70-80% of cases.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Cochlear implants lead to improved speech and sound perception : This statement is true. Cochlear implants bypass damaged hair cells in the cochlea and directly stimulate the auditory nerve, allowing for improved detection and discrimination of sounds. This leads to enhanced speech perception and better understanding of environmental sounds.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Cochlear implants lead to improved speech and sound perception</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Cochlear implants offer a better chance of acquiring normal or near-normal verbal skills: This statement is true, especially for children who receive implants early. Early implantation (before 6 years of age in pre-lingual deaf children) allows for better development of auditory pathways and improved chances of developing age-appropriate speech and language skills.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Cochlear implants offer a better chance of acquiring normal or near-normal verbal skills:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Cochlear implants improve sound localization and discrimination : This statement is true. Cochlear implants help improve sound discrimination abilities, allowing recipients to better distinguish between different sounds. Bilateral implantation particularly improves sound localization abilities by providing binaural cues necessary for spatial hearing.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Cochlear implants improve sound localization and discrimination</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Contrary to increasing tinnitus, cochlear implants typically reduce or suppress pre-existing tinnitus in most patients due to the masking effect of electrical stimulation and reorganization of central auditory pathways following implantation.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

A negative antibody test indicates that the woman is not immune to VZV and is susceptible to chickenpox. If a pregnant woman is not immune and has had significant exposure, she is at risk of developing chickenpox and should be administered varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG). VZIG is effective up to 10 days after contact. Symptomatic treatment of chickenpox in pregnancy includes: Oral Acyclovir if within 24 hours of the onset of the rash and if the gestational age is greater than 20 weeks. Intravenous Acyclovir should be given to all pregnant women with severe chickenpox. VZIG has no therapeutic benefit once chickenpox has started. Women who develop chickenpox in pregnancy should be referred to a fetal medicine specialist at 16\u201320 weeks or 5 weeks after infection to look for congenital varicella syndrome. If the infection occurs in the last 4 weeks of pregnancy, there is a risk of varicella infection in the newborn. Planned delivery should normally be avoided for at least 7 days after the onset of the maternal rash to allow for the passive transfer of antibodies from mother to child.</li><li>\u2022 Pregnant women with uncertain or no previous history of chickenpox, who have been exposed to the infection, should have a blood test to determine their immunity to Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV).</li><li>\u2022 A negative antibody test indicates that the woman is not immune to VZV and is susceptible to chickenpox.</li><li>\u2022 If a pregnant woman is not immune and has had significant exposure, she is at risk of developing chickenpox and should be administered varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG).</li><li>\u2022 VZIG is effective up to 10 days after contact.</li><li>\u2022 Symptomatic treatment of chickenpox in pregnancy includes: Oral Acyclovir if within 24 hours of the onset of the rash and if the gestational age is greater than 20 weeks.
