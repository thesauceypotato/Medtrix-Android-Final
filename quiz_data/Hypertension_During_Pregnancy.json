      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>2 and 5 The given clinical scenario points towards pre- eclampsia in pregnancy due to increased BP along with proteinuria occurring for the first time after 20weeks. The pathophysiology is as follows - Point 1. There is increased vascular sensitivity to the pressor agent angiotensin-II . Angiotensinase activity is depressed, following proteinuria with elimination of alpha2 globulin. Point 2. There is an imbalance in different components of prostaglandins \u2014relative or absolute deficiency of vasodilator prostaglandin (PGI2) from vascular endothelium and increased synthesis of thromboxane (TXA2), a potent vasoconstrictor in platelets. 3. Imbalance of angiogenic and antiangiogenic proteins in placental vascular bed \u2014 there is overproduction of two antiangiogenic factors from the trophoblastic tissue . These two antiangiogenic factors are: (a) soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase I (SFlt-1) and (b) soluble endoglin. SFlt-1 binds with VEGF and placental-like growth factor (PLGF) and causes endothelial cell dysfunction. Option 4. Abnormal lipid metabolism \u2014results in more oxidative stress. Lipid peroxides, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide anion radicals \u2014 cause endothelial injury and dysfunction. Platelet and neutrophil activation, cytokines, superoxide radical production and endothelial damage are in a vicious cycle. Point 5. Endothelin-1 is synthesized by endothelial cells, and it is a potent vasoconstrictor compared to angiotensin-II. Endothelin-1 also contributes to the cause of hypertension. Hence points 2 and 5 are false in the given options.</p>\n<p></p>",
