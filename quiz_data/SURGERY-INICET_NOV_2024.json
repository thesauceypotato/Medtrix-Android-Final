Modulating the stress/inflammatory response at the time of surgery may have long-term sequelae over periods of months or longer. For example, \ud835\udf71- blockers are associated with improved short- and long-term survival after major surgery , perhaps by modulating the effects of the hyperadrenergic state induced by surgical stress. In \u2018open\u2019 surgery the use of epidural analgesia to reduce pain, block the cortisol stress response and attenuate postoperative insulin resistance may, via effects on the body\u2019s protein economy, favourably affect many of the patient-centred outcomes that are important to postoperative recovery. However, because of the reduction in wound size and tissue trauma, it should be noted that epidural analgesia is no longer recommended for laparoscopic surgery . Patient-controlled analgesia is usually sufficient and avoids the fluid shifts and hypotension seen with epidurals. Adjuncts such as \u2018one-shot\u2019 spinal diamorphine and/or a 6\u201312-hour infusion of intravenous lidocaine have been suggested to be opiate sparing, to improve gut function and to enhance overall recovery</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Duodenal ulcers are the most common, but jejunal ulceration may also occur presence of jejunal ulcers should raise suspicion for a gastrin-secreting PNET. Abdominal pain is the most common symptom and diarrhea is caused by large volume of gastric acid secretion Ninety percent of gastrinomas are located within the gastrinoma triangle Diagnosis It is considered in all patients with intractable peptic ulcers (especially jejunal ulcers), severe esophagitis, or persistent secretory diarrhea If the pH is <2 and the FSG is more than 10-fold elevated, the diagnosis is confirmed. If the FSG is less than 10-fold higher, a secretin provocation test should be performed False-negative results may be caused by the presence of Helicobacter pylori Treatment Surgical: all patients with sporadic gastrinoma without metastasis should have a surgical operation.

The diagnosis of TEF is considered in an infant with excessive salivation along with coughing or choking experienced at first oral feeding.
