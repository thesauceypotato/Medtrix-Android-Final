Enterogenous cysts are derived from a diverticulum of the mesenteric border of the intestine or duplication of the intestine . They have a thicker wall than chylolymphatic cysts and are lined by mucous membranes, sometimes ciliated. Their mucinous content can be colorless or yellowish-brown due to past hemorrhage. The muscle in their wall and adjacent bowel share a standard blood supply, and their removal always entails resection of the corresponding portion of the intestine.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Mesenteric cysts can be of different types, including chylolymphatic, straightforward (mesothelial), heterogeneous, urogenital remnant, and dermoid (teratomatous cyst).

No apparent cause or known underlying lung pathology characterizes spontaneous pneumothorax or primary spontaneous pneumothorax . There may be contributing factors, such as cigarette smoke, family history, and rupture of the bulla (tiny air-filled sacs in the lung tissue), but these will not cause pneumothorax. Secondary or non-spontaneous or complicated pneumothorax occurs due to an underlying lung pathology such as COPD , Asthma , Tuberculosis , Cystic Fibrosis , or Whooping Cough. A pneumothorax can further be classified as a tension or non-tension pneumothorax.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>A tension pneumothorax is caused by excessive pressure buildup around the lung due to a breach in the lung surface which will admit air into the pleural cavity during inspiration but will not allow any air to escape during expiration. The breach acts as a one-way valve. This leads to lung collapse . The air is removed through the surgical incision by inserting an underwater drain in the pleural cavity. This excessive pressure can also prevent the heart from pumping effectively, which may lead to shock. A non-tension pneumothorax is not considered as severe as there is no ongoing accumulation of air, and therefore there is no increased pressure on the organs and the chest. Treatment options include: Conservative management with observation until the body naturally resorbs the air Simple aspiration Chest tube placement - Simple chest tube placement alone has a high recurrence rate (about 65%) in patients with LAM. Heimlich valve (HV) insertion - a lightweight one-way valve designed for the ambulatory treatment of pneumothorax (with an intercostal catheter) Pleurodesis through a chest tube - a procedure that obliterates the pleural space to prevent future pneumothoraces. Mechanical (using physical abrasion) Chemical (using talc, doxycycline, bleomycin , or other agents) . While chemical pleurodesis through a chest tube can be successful, this may result in incomplete pleurodesis due to the uneven distribution of the chemical. Surgery - Surgical treatment using video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) , is the preferred approach. A wide bore needle in the 5th ICS followed by ICD/ Thoracostomy is the most appropriate approach for this patient in the emergency setting.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The pleural cavity pressure is < the atmospheric pressure The pleural cavity = pressure is the atmospheric pressure The pleural cavity pressure is > the atmospheric pressure Indications for surgical intervention for pneumothorax include: Second ipsilateral pneumothorax First contralateral pneumothorax Bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax Pneumothorax fails to settle despite chest drainage Spontaneous haemothorax: professions at risk (e.g., pilots, divers) Pregnancy</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Bile duct injury can be caused by acute or chronic inflammation, obesity, anatomic variation, bleeding, acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis, cholangitis, and obstructive jaundice . Inadequate surgical technique and failure to identify structures before ligating or dividing them are common causes of significant biliary injury. Intraoperative cholangiography may help limit the extent of bile duct injury but does not prevent it. Symptoms of bile duct injury may include jaundice with or without abdominal pain. Major ductal injuries are often recognized intraoperatively due to bile leakage, abnormal cholangiogram, or late anatomy recognition. Patients may present with cholangitis or cirrhosis months or years after prior surgery due to a biliary tract injury. Diagnosis of bile duct injury involves imaging studies like USG or CT . The patient should be stabilized with immediate parenteral antibiotics, image-guided percutaneous drainage of fluid collections , and Cholangiography done to identify the level and nature of the Postoperative biliary strictures are best diagnosed with PTC , while ERCP is useful for patients with bile duct continuity who require urgent cholangiography and biliary decompression. CT arteriography is useful in preoperatively evaluating patients with benign biliary strictures to detect unrecognized injury to the hepatic artery or a portal vein branch. In patients presenting with late strictures with evidence of liver dysfunction, a CT arteriogram should be performed to evaluate for evidence of portal hypertension.</p>\n<p></p>",

ERCP : standard treatment for a bile duct leak since the bile duct does not dilate, it might be tough to find the exact position of the bile leak from radiological examination. Only about 25% of major bile duct injuries (common bile duct or hepatic duct) are recognized during Most commonly, intraoperative bile leakage, recognition of the correct anatomy, and an abnormal cholangiogram lead to the diagnosis of a bile duct injury. More than half of patients with biliary injury will present within the first postoperative month. The remainder will present months or years later, with recurrent cholangitis or cirrhosis from a remote bile duct injury. In the early postoperative period, patients present either with a progressive elevation  of  liver  function  tests  due  to  an  occluded or a Stenosed bile duct or with a bile leak from an injured duct. Bile leak, most commonly from the cystic duct stump, a transected aberrant right hepatic duct, or a lateral injury to the main bile duct, usually presents with pain, fever, and a mild elevation of liver function tests. A CT scan or an ultrasound will show either a  collection  (biloma)  in  the  gallbladder  area  or  free  fluid (bile) in the peritoneum (Fig. 32-24). Bilious drainage through operatively placed  drains or through  the wounds  is The site of the bile leak can be confirmed noninvasively with a HIDA scan.

Bowel visualization is usually seen within 1 hour in most patients. Nonvisualization of the gallbladder suggests acute cholecystitis . In chronic cholecystitis , a contracted gallbladder can reduce or delay gallbladder visualization. Biliary scintigraphy can aid in diagnosing bile leaks and iatrogenic biliary obstruction.

Clinical signs and symptoms associated with a febrile UTI in neonates may include irritability, persistent high fever, and listlessness.  In cases of VUR and febrile UTI associated with a serious underlying urinary tract abnormality, the neonate could present with respiratory distress, failure to thrive, renal failure, flank masses, and urinary ascites.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Incomplete duplex ureters with a \u2018Y\u2019 ureter arise when the ureteric bud bifurcates after its initial development from the Wolfan duct.</p>\n<p></p>",

Patients with inflammatory carcinoma usually have a history revealing the rapid onset of disease (15 days in the above case) with progression over weeks to 3 months. The hallmark of inflammatory breast cancer is diffuse tumor involvement of the dermal lymphatic channels within the breast and overlying skin, often without an underlying tumor mass. Inflammatory breast cancer manifests clinically as erythema (as shown in the mage), edema and warmth of the breast due to lymphatic obstruction. There may be no abnormality on mammography beyond skin thickening and a palpable mass is not required for the diagnosis. Inflammatory breast cancer i s the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer . The pathologic hallmark of inflammatory cancer is the presence of tumor cells within dermal lymphatics . Axillary nodal metastases are common, and a significant risk exists for distant metastases. Giant fibroadenomas are usually seen in the early reproductive years. These are benign solid encapsulated tumors . It is a slow-growing tumor and presents as a painless lump in the breast. Phyllodes tumor , aka osteosarcoma phyllodes, is generally present as a large tumor with an unevenly bosselated surface. This tumor does not infiltrate the skin though the overlying skin becomes thin and tense due to swelling. Nipple retraction is not seen in this condition. Galactocele usually presents as a solitary subareolar cyst.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Comparison of Inflammatory CA, Giant fibroadenoma, Phyllodes tumor and Galactocele Inflammatory Breast Cancer Giant Fibroadenoma Phyllodes Tumor Galactocele Age of onset Typically in women in their 40s and 50s Typically in young women in their teens or early 20s Typically in women in their 30s to 50s Typically in women who are lactating or recently stopped breastfeeding Presentation Rapid onset of breast swelling, redness, and warmth; skin may appear \"peau d'orange\" A palpable breast mass that may be large and firm A breast lump that may be painless or painful; rapid growth may suggest malignancy A breast lump that is usually painless and slowly enlarging Treatment Mammogram may show diffuse skin thickening and enlarged lymph nodes; ultrasound and MRI can also be used for diagnosis Mammogram and ultrasound may show a well-circumscribed mass; biopsy needed for diagnosis Mammogram and ultrasound may show a heterogeneous mass with cystic spaces; biopsy needed for diagnosis Mammogram and ultrasound may show a well-circumscribed cyst; biopsy needed for diagnosis Prognosis Multimodal therapy including chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation Surgical excision with or without biopsy Surgical excision with wide margins; radiation or chemotherapy may be necessary for malignant tumors Observation or surgical excision if symptomatic; no further treatment needed if benign Prognosis Poor overall survival rate; high risk of recurrence and metastasis Excellent prognosis; low risk of recurrence or malignancy Prognosis varies depending on histology and degree of malignancy; risk of recurrence and metastasis higher for malignant tumors Excellent prognosis; no risk of recurrence or malignancy</p>\n<p></p>",

This carries a risk of injury to the long thoracic nerve (from C5-C7 roots of the brachial plexus). It innervates the serratus anterior muscle, and thus, injury to this nerve during surgery results in paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle leading to winging of the scapula. The external laryngeal nerve is a motor nerve that supplies the cricothyroid muscle. The close relationship of the external laryngeal nerve to the superior thyroid artery puts the nerve at potential risk when the artery is clamped during thyroid surgeries.
