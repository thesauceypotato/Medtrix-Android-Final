While both are primarily unilateral, Bartholin abscesses are often tender to palpation, erythematous, indurated, and may have an area of fluctuance and/or purulent drainage. Treatment Asymptomatic Bartholin cysts do not require further treatment. Bartholin abscesses may be treated with incision and drainage with Word catheter placement due to ease and effectiveness of treatment. Marsupialization is the procedure of choice. Women with recurrent cysts or those who are post-menopausal (risk of malignancy) should have the cyst completely excised.</li><li>\u2022 The physical exam will often reveal asymmetry with a protrusion of one side (left or right) of the inferior aspect of the vulva.</li><li>\u2022 Bartholin gland abscesses, unlike Bartholin cysts, are very painful.</li><li>\u2022 While both are primarily unilateral, Bartholin abscesses are often tender to palpation, erythematous, indurated, and may have an area of fluctuance and/or purulent drainage.</li><li>\u2022 Treatment</li><li>\u2022 Asymptomatic Bartholin cysts do not require further treatment.</li><li>\u2022 Bartholin abscesses may be treated with incision and drainage with Word catheter placement due to ease and effectiveness of treatment.</li><li>\u2022 Marsupialization is the procedure of choice.</li><li>\u2022 Women with recurrent cysts or those who are post-menopausal (risk of malignancy) should have the cyst completely excised.</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Other options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

More recently, there has been an increasing number of reports of resistance to cephalosporins, including ceftriaxone, which is currently the first-line treatment for Gonorrhoea. The development of drug resistance in Gonorrhoea is largely due to the bacterium's ability to acquire resistance genes through horizontal gene transfer and spontaneous mutations.</li><li>\u2022 Gonorrhoea, caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae , is known for developing significant resistance to multiple antibiotics.</li><li>\u2022 Over the years, Neisseria gonorrhoeae has shown resistance to several classes of antibiotics, including penicillin, tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones.</li><li>\u2022 More recently, there has been an increasing number of reports of resistance to cephalosporins, including ceftriaxone, which is currently the first-line treatment for Gonorrhoea.</li><li>\u2022 The development of drug resistance in Gonorrhoea is largely due to the bacterium's ability to acquire resistance genes through horizontal gene transfer and spontaneous mutations.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.
