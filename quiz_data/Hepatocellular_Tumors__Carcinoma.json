Cirrhosis is characterized by the development of fibrosis and the disruption of normal liver architecture.

It can be-portal fibrosis, perisinusoidal fibrosis, or bridging fibrosis. Nodules : The fibrosis can lead to the formation of nodules, which are groups of hepatocytes surrounded by fibrous tissue. The remaining hepatocytes may undergo proliferative changes, leading to the formation of regenerative nodules. Inflammation : Lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages, can be seen in the liver tissue, particularly in the areas of active fibrosis. Distorted architecture : The liver architecture is disrupted, and the normal lobular structure is lost. Hepatocyte damage : Hepatocytes may show signs of degeneration, necrosis, or apoptosis, which can lead to the loss of liver function. Cholestasis : The bile ducts may become damaged or blocked, leading to cholestasis, which is the accumulation of bile acids and bilirubin in the liver tissue and blood. This can cause jaundice and itching.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B . Hepatocellular carcinoma: It is a type of primary liver cancer that can develop in patients with cirrhosis. Option: C. Cholangiocarcinoma: It is a type of cancer that develops in the bile ducts, and it is not commonly associated with chronic alcoholism as the primary etiology. Option: D. Lymphoma: a group of blood and lymph tumors that develop from lymphocytes.</p>\n<p></p>",
