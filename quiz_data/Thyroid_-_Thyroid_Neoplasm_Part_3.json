For this reason, follicular lesions on FNA cannot be diagnosed as malignant without clinical features such as metastases. Multiple foci of follicular carcinoma are seldom seen, and lymph node involvement is much less common than in papillary carcinoma. Blood-borne metastases are more common, and the eventual mortality rate, although still low, is twice that of papillary cancer. H\u00fcrthle cell tumors are a rare variant of follicular neoplasm in which oxyphil (H\u00fcrthle, Askanazy) cells predominate histologically.

Conn\u2019s syndrome: Incidence: Primary hyperaldosteronism (PHA) is defined by hypertension as a result of aldosterone hypersecretion. In PHA, plasma renin activity is suppressed. Among patients with hypertension, the incidence of PHA is approximately 2%. Clinical features: Most patients are between 30 and 50 years of age, with a female predominance. Apart from hypertension, patients complain of non-specific symptoms: headache, muscle weakness, cramps, neurological events, polyuria, polydipsia, and nocturia. Diagnosis : The key feature of the biochemical diagnosis is the assessment of the aldosterone-to-plasma renin activity ratio. Hypokalaemia may be present. Antihypertensive and diuretic therapy , which cause hypokalaemia and influence the renin\u2013angiotensin aldosterone system, must be discontinued. Once the biochemical diagnosis is confirmed, MRI or CT should be performed to distinguish unilateral from bilateral disease. Conn\u2019s adenomas usually measure between 1 and 2 cm and are detected by CT with a sensitivity of 80\u201390%.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Conn's syndrome, also known as primary hyperaldosteronism, is a medical condition characterized by excess aldosterone production by the adrenal glands. In Conn's syndrome, excess aldosterone production increases sodium retention and potassium excretion, which can result in high blood pressure, low potassium levels, and metabolic alkalosis (an elevated pH in the blood). a benign tumor most commonly causes Conn's syndrome in one of the adrenal glands, known as an aldosterone-producing adenoma. It can also be caused by hyperplasia (overgrowth) of the adrenal glands, which can be either unilateral or bilateral. In rare cases, Conn's syndrome can be caused by a genetic mutation that affects the regulation of aldosterone production.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Incidentaloma An adrenal mass found on imaging that was not conducted to diagnose adrenal disease is an incidentaloma. The cause of such a mass can be either a benign or malignant tumor of the cortex or medulla, or it can originate outside the adrenal gland. These tumors may or may not secrete hormones and can be classified as either non-functioning (inactive) or functioning (excess hormone secretion). Option: C. Cushing syndrome Hypercortisolism is caused by excess ACTH secretion due to various factors, including pituitary-dependent and pituitary-independent Cushing's syndrome. ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors are the most common cause. Left untreated, hypercortisolism increases the risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Identifying and treating the underlying cause is essential while minimizing long-term hormonal deficiency or dependence on medication. Option: D. Adrenocortical carcinoma Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare and aggressive cancer that develops in the adrenal cortex. The prognosis for ACC is generally poor, partly due to late diagnosis. ACC can occur sporadically but can also be associated with specific genetic tumor syndromes. Optimal surgery is the best chance for a cure, making preoperative diagnosis and planning crucial for successful treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Treatment for Conn's syndrome typically involves surgery to remove the affected adrenal gland if a tumor or hyperplasia is present. In some cases, medications may also help manage blood pressure and potassium levels.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>MEN 2B MEN 1 is characterized by the triad of tumors in the anterior pituitary gland , mostly presenting as prolactinomas or non-functioning tumors , hyperplasia of the parathyroids causing primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT), and pancreaticoduodenal endocrine tumors (PETs). The syndrome was first described by Wermer in 1954 and is therefore also called Wermer\u2019s syndrome . It is caused by germline mutations in the menin gene located on chromosome 11. MEN 2 is divided into three subtypes : familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), MEN 2A, and MEN 2B . Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) plays a vital role in all subtypes. MEN 2 is caused by germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene located on chromosome 10. MEN 2A is characterized by MTC, pHPT, and mostly bilateral phaeochromocytomas. MTC combined with phaeochromocytomas alone is called Sipple\u2019s syndrome . Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) is characterized by distinct mutations in RET and MTC independently as the clinical manifestation. MEN 2B comprises MTC, phaeochromocytoma, characteristic facial and oral mucosal neurinomas, and intestinal ganglion-pneumatosis , accompanied by a Marfanoid habitus . Besides the different clinical pictures, the most crucial difference between MEN 1 and MEN 2 , besides the other clinical pictures, is that MEN 2 is characterized by a well-understood genotype\u2013phenotype correlation. This means that depending on the particular mutation in the RET proto-oncogene, the phenotypic appearance and the onset of endocrine tumors will be different and can be predicted from the type of mutation. This is not the case in MEN 1 syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>MEN 2B is resulting from RET mutations and is responsible for a prevalence of 0.2 per 100,000 individuals. MEN 2B has an early-onset and aggressive form of MTC (present in 100% of cases), PPGL (present in 59% of cases), a marfanoid habitus, and the presence of ganglioneuromatosis in the oral mucosa and gastrointestinal tract. However, unlike other subtypes, half of MEN 2B cases are due to new mutations not inherited from either parent. Familial MTC (FMTC), a form of MEN 2, only presents with MTC without additional endocrine tumors. When MTC is combined with PCC, the condition is called Sipple's syndrome.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Most individuals affected by MEN 2 develop medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), the main factor determining their survival. Although pheochromocytomas (PCCs) are typically noncancerous and less likely malignant in individuals with MEN 2, they tend to affect both adrenal glands. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in MEN 2 is generally asymptomatic and may not require surgery.</p>\n<p></p>",

Gradually the superior pole is mobilized taking care not to dissect below the cricoid cartilage, at which point the RLN is at risk. The tracheoesophageal groove should not be entered as the RLN is yet identified. RLN is identified and confirmed by the anatomical location, direction of travel, and the nerve monitor, if in use. The pre-tracheal fascia condenses into Berry\u2019s ligament at this stage. Small vessels within the ligament retract if not controlled with bipolar diathermy or ties, and the resulting bleeding can disorientate the surgeon placing the nerve at risk. If total thyroidectomy is indicated the procedure is repeated on the contralateral side. If lobectomy alone is indicated, the isthmus should be divided between clamps and oversewn. Consideration may be given to the reimplantation of parathyroids to the sternomastoid muscle if they appear devascularised. Following complete hemostasis, the strap muscles are loosely reapproximated to avoid a water-tight seal but to the recent adhesion between skin and trachea. The wound is then closed in layers with absorbable suture to platysma and skin closure.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Thyroid surgery involves the removal of part or all of the thyroid gland. The most common surgical approach for thyroidectomy is a collar incision made horizontally across the neck crease . A vertical incision may be used in certain cases, such as when a large goiter or cancer involves the central part of the gland. For lobectomy , the thyroid isthmus is divided, and the lobe to be removed is dissected. The strap muscles are divided to provide greater exposure to the gland but are usually preserved to maintain neck function. Complications of thyroid surgery include bleeding, infection, nerve injury, and hypothyroidism.</p>\n<p></p>",

A lacrimal probe or length of stiff nylon suture is inserted into the duct from which the discharge is emerging. A tennis racquet incision can encompass the entire duct, or a peri-areolar incision can be used and the nipple flap dissected to reach the duct. The duct is then excised. A papilloma is nearly always situated within 4\u20135cm of the nipple orifice. The affected duct may not be visualized, and biopsy systems are currently rudimentary. CONE EXCISION OF THE MAJOR DUCT (HADFIELD/SUBAREOLAR RESECTION): When the duct of origin of nipple bleeding is uncertain or when there is bleeding or discharge from multiple ducts, the entire central duct system can be excised for histological examination without the sacrifice of the breast form. A peri-areolar incision is made, and a cone of tissue is removed with its apex just deep to the surface of the nipple and its base on the pectoral fascia. A series of purse-string sutures may obliterate the resulting defect, although a temporary suction drain will reduce the chance of long-term deformity. It is vital to warn the patient that she will be unable to breastfeed after this and may experience altered nipple sensation.</p>\n<p></p>",
