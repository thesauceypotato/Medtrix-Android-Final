      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>More common in age group of 35-45 years The age of onset for bipolar type I disorder ranges from children of age 5 or 6 years to adults of age 50 years or older; with a mean age of 18 years. The mean age of onset for bipolar type II is 20 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A - Bipolar type 1 disorder has an equal prevalence among men and women. The lifetime prevalence of bipolar type 1 disorder is 0 to 2.4%, while that of  bipolar type 2 disorder is 0.3-4.8%. Option B - Suicide attempt is seen in around 15% of people with bipolar disorder. Option D: The prevalence of bipolar disorder is estimated to be around 1%, which is a true statement.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>It is important to differentiate between bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, as the treatment approaches differ. Lithium is a commonly used medication for the pharmacological management of bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p></p>",

The area marked in red is characteristic of changes seen in REM phase of sleep, since: Zone A shows positive activity (EOG) Zone B shows mixed wave activity (EEG) Zone C shows very minimal activity (EMG)</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B - NREM 1 The low-voltage fast EEG pattern of wakefulness gradually gives way to slower frequencies, as NREM sleep goes from stage N1 (decrease in alpha) to stage N2 (spindles, K-complexes) to stage N3 (increasing amplitude and regularity of delta rhythm). Option C - NREM 2 Stage II is the predominant sleep stage during a normal night's sleep. The distinct and principal EEG criterion to establish stage II sleep is the appearance of sleep spindles or K complexes . The presence of sleep spindles is necessary and sufficient to define stage II sleep. Option D - NREM 3 This is a period of deep sleep where any noises or activity in the environment may fail to wake the sleeping person. During this deep sleep stage, your body starts its physical repairs.</p>\n<p></p>",
