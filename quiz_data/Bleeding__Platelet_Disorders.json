He is most probably suffering from ITP.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura: Acute ITP Acute ITP is mainly a disease of childhood occurring with equal frequency in both sexes . Symptoms appear abruptly, often 1 to 2 weeks after a self-limited viral illness, which appears to trigger the development of autoantibodies through uncertain mechanisms . Unlike chronic ITP, acute ITP is self-limited , usually resolving spontaneously within 6 months . Glucocorticoids are given only if the thrombocytopenia is severe . In about 20% of children, usually those without a viral prodrome, thrombocytopenia persists; these children have a childhood form of chronic ITP that follows a course similar to the adult disease Chronic ITP Chronic ITP is caused by the autoantibody-mediated destruction of platelets . Etiology: Idiopathic (Immune) Secondary Autoimmune diseases Viral infections Autoantibodies , most often directed against platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb\u2013IIIa or Ib\u2013IX , can be demonstrated in the plasma and bound to the platelet surface in about 80% of patients. As in autoimmune hemolytic anaemias, antiplatelet antibodies act as opsonins that are recognized by IgG Fc receptors expressed on phagocytes, leading to increased platelet destruction . Thrombocytopenia is usually markedly improved by splenectomy , indicating that the spleen is the major site of removal of opsonized platelets, but the spleen is of normal size . The marrow reveals a modestly increased number of megakaryocytes . The secondary changes relate to haemorrhage, often in the form of petechial bleeds into the skin and mucous membranes . The peripheral blood often reveals abnormally large platelets (mega thrombocytes), which are a sign of accelerated thrombopoiesis. Occurs most commonly in adult women younger than 40 years of age. The female-to-male ratio is 3:1 There is a history of easy bruising, nosebleeds, gingival bleeding, and haemorrhages into soft tissues from relatively minor trauma. Almost all patients respond to glucocorticoids (which inhibit phagocyte function), but many relapses following the withdrawal of steroids.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.

Infectious mononucleosis is characterized by fever, sore throat, generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and the appearance in the blood of atypical activated T lymphocytes (mononucleosis cells). Some people develop hepatitis, meningoencephalitis, and pneumonitis. Infectious mononucleosis occurs principally in late adolescents or young adults among upper socioeconomic classes in higher-income nations. In the rest of the world, primary infection with EBV occurs in childhood and is usually asymptomatic. EBV is transmitted by close human contact, frequently through saliva during kissing . It is not known whether the source of the virus is B cells, oropharyngeal epithelial cells, or both EBV infects B cells and possibly epithelial cells of the oropharynx. It has been hypothesized that EBV initially infects oropharyngeal epithelial cells and then spreads to underlying lymphoid tissue (tonsils and adenoids), where mature B cells are infected. An EBV envelope glycoprotein binds CD21 (CR2) , the receptor for the C3d component of complement , which is present in B cells .

The most common presenting symptom s are spontaneous bleeding from mucous membranes (e.g., epistaxis), excessive bleeding from wounds, or menorrhagia .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Von Willebrand Disease: Von Willebrand disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder of humans . The bleeding tendency is usually mild and often goes unnoticed until some hemostatic stress, such as surgery or a dental procedure, reveals its presence. The most common presenting symptom s are spontaneous bleeding from mucous membranes (e.g., epistaxis), excessive bleeding from wounds, or menorrhagia . It is usually transmitted as an autosomal dominant disorder , but rare autosomal recessive variants also exist. 3 types are recognised: Type 1 and type 3 von Willebrand disease are associated with quantitative defects in vWF . Type 1 , is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a mild to moderate vWF deficiency. Type 3 disease is an autosomal disorde r usually caused by deletions or frameshift mutations involving both alleles, resulting in little to no vWF synthesis . Because vWF stabilizes factor VIII in the circulation , factor VIII levels are also reduced in type 3 disease and the associated bleeding disorder is often severe . Type 2 von Willebrand disease is characterized by qualitative defects in vWF . It is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder . Patients with von Willebrand disease have defects in platelet function despite having normal platelet counts . The plasma level of active vWF, measured as the ristocetin cofactor activity, is reduced . Persons with types 1 or 2 von Willebrand disease facing hemostatic challenges (dental work, surgery) can be treated with desmopressin (which stimulates vWF release), infusions of plasma concentrates containing factor VIII and vWF , or with recombinant vWF . By contrast, rare patients with type 3 disease must be treated prophylactically with plasma concentrates and factor VIII infusions to prevent severe \u201chaemophilia-like\u201d bleeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. aPTT is normal. False, vWF stabilises factor VIII , which takes part in the Intrinsic pathway . So, in vWD, when vWF is deficient, aPTT is prolonged. Option: B. Bleeding is normal. False, because there is defective platelet adhesion in vWD, there is an increase in bleeding time . Option: C. Most common pattern of inheritance is autosomal recessive. False, the most common pattern of inheritance is Autosomal dominant for vWD type I.</p>\n<p></p>",
