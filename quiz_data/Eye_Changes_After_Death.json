The rectum is the ideal place to record temperature, except in cases of sodomy. The thermometer should be inserted 8 to 10 cm. and left there for two minutes. Variations in rectal temperature: The rectal temperature is between 36.5 to 37.5\u00b0C. Rectal temperature is about 0.6\u00b0C higher than oral. There are individual and daily variations up to 1 to 1.5\u00b0C. Being the lowest in the early morning and highest in the late evening. During sleep, the rectal temperature is half' to one\u00b0C lower.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option : A, B & D.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Sulfhemoglobin The Marbling of Skin: The superficial veins, especially over the roots of the limb, thighs, sides of the abdomen, shoulders, chest and neck, are stained greenish-brown or purplish-red depending on the total amount of sulphhaemoglobin formation within the affected vessels (linear branching pattern) due to the haemolysis of red cells, which stains the wall of the vessel and infiltrates into the tissue, giving a marbled appearance (red, then the greenish pattern in skin resembling the branches of a tree) This starts in 24 hours but is prominent in 36 to 48 hours. The clotted blood becomes fluid, so the position of the postmortem staining is altered, and the fluid blood collects in the serous cavities. Putrefactive effusion of foul -smelling blood stained fluid into the pleural cavities usually ~tarts at about the time when the skin becomes macerated; effusions usually do not exceed 60 to 100 ml. unless death resulted from drowning, when several hundred ml. of drowning medium which oozed out through the lungs and visceral pleura, may be present in the thoracic cavities.

The opacity of the Cornea: This may occur in certain diseases (cholera, wasting diseases) before death. The opacity is due to drying and is delayed for about two hours if the lids are closed after death. Suppose the eyelids are open for a few hours after death. In that case, a film of cell debris and mucus forms two yellow triangles on the sclera at each side of the iris, with the base towards the margin of the cornea and apex towards the medial or lateral canthus of the eye, which become brown and then black called \"tache noir\" within 3 to 4 hours, upon which dust settles, and the surface becomes wrinkled (artefact). Flaccidity of the Eyeball: The eyes look sunken and become softer within minutes due to reduced intraocular tension. During life, the intraocular tension varies between 14 to 25 gm; soon after death, it is less than 12 gm; within half an hour, it is less than 3 gm., and becomes nil at the end two hours. Pupils: Soon after death, pupils are slightly dilated because of the relaxation of muscles of the iris. Later, they are constricted with the onset of rigour mortis of the constrictor muscles and fluid evaporation. Retinal Vessels: Fragmentation or segmentation (tuking or shunting) of the blood columns (Kevorkian sign) in the retinal vessels appear within minutes after death and persists for about an hour. This occurs all over the body due to loss of blood pressure, but it can be seen only in the retina by an ophthalmoscope.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A .
