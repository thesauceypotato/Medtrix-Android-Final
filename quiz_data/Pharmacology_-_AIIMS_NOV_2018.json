Even liposomal preparations of amphotericin B (c AMB, LAMB, ABCD, ABLC) are nephrotoxic, though less as compared to conventional Amphotericin B. More than 90% of vancomycin is excreted through glomerular filtration. In case of renal failure, there may be less excretion which leads to toxicity of Vancomycin due to its striking accumulation in body (ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, red man syndrome). Half-life of vancomycin can increase to 6\u201310 days in case of anephric patients. Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside. Aminoglycosides are most potent to cause both ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides are excreted almost entirely by glomerular filtration. High concentration of aminoglycosides is found in otic fluid and by virtue of the process of elimination: high concentration is found in urinary tract. Dose modification required in renal failure. Cockcroft\u2013Gault equation C Cr = creatinine clearance (expressed in mL/min); S Cr = serum creatinine (expressed in mg/dL) Among tetracyclines, minocycline and doxycycline are safe in renal impairment cases. Doxycycline does not cause nephrotoxicity and is excreted through bile. Other tetracyclines can cause Fanconi syndrome characterized by toxic metabolite accumulation (tetracyclines and epihydrotetracyclines). So, answer is Doxycycline.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Side-effects of drugs Ceftriaxone-cholecystitis Imipenem-seizures Vancomycin-Red man syndrome, mild nephrotoxicity Aminoglycosides- nephrotoxicity & ototoxicity Macrolides- UGI distress Clindamycin- Gl distress, diarrhoea Doxycycline- phototoxicity, teeth discoloration Metronidazole- metallic taste, stomatitis, seizures/encephalopathy with deranged LFT Co-trimoxazole- allergy, photosensitivity, raised Cr.

Sulfamethoxazole is a Sulfonamide, and combination of a Sulfonamide with an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (trimethoprim or pyrimethamine) provides synergistic activity because of sequential inhibition of folate synthesis. Mother taking sulfonamides in third trimester increases the possibility of child suffering from kernicterus (toxic encephalopathy). This occurs due to the affinity of sulfonamides to bind to proteins (PPB > 90%) which displaces bilirubin from its binding site. As a result, bilirubin can cross the immature blood\u2013brain barrier in fetus leading to toxic effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Cotrimoxazole - Uses Uncomplicated infection of the lower urinary tract infection Cystitis (5 tablet dose) chronic and recurrent urinary tract infections (including enterobacteriaceae) - 3-10 days Respiratory tract infection - lower and upper, chronic bronchitis, facio-maxillary infections, otitis media due to gm+ve cocci and H influenzae etc Typhoid Bacterial diarrhoeas & dysentery: due to campylobacter, E coli, Shigella etc. Pneumocystis jiroveci: Severe pneumonia - Prophylactic use in AIDS patients with neutropenia.

S Warfarin is the most active form: Metabolism of S warfarin is by CYP2C9 leading to the formation of 7-OH warfarin Metabolism of R warfarin is by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP3A4 leading to the formation of 6-OH warfarin, 8-OH warfarin, 10-OH warfarin As Carbamazepine is enzyme inducer, it induces metabolism of warfarin and hence warfarin concentration decreases and it can lead to therapeutic failure Rest of drugs: Isoniazid, Amiodarone, cimetidine are microsomal enzyme inhibitors leading to warfarin toxicity and can lead to bleeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA HEPARIN vs. WARFARIN CHEAT SHEET Heparin Warfarin Pathway Affects the intrinsic pathway Affects the extrinsic pathway MOA Inactivates thrombin and factor Xa Inhibits synthesis of clotting factors Route IV or subQ PO Teratogenic Does not cross placenta or into breast milk Crosses placenta (teratogenic) Onset Rapid (minutes) Slow (hours) Duration Brief (hours) Prolonged (days) Drug interactions Few drug interactions Many drug interactions Elimination Eliminated renally Eliminated hepatically Monitoring aPTT PT Antidote Protamine Phytomenadione (Vitamin K)</p>\n<p></p>",
