      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Fat embolism syndrome The presence of respiratory insufficiency and altered mental  status following a long bone fracture(fracture of the femur) is suggestive of fat embolism. Fat embolism syndrome results from the presence of numerous fat emboli within the microcirculation . It most commonly occurs after the fracture of the long bone or pelvis. They present with non-specific symptoms like tachypnea,tachycardia, and fever that manifest within 24-48 hours after the injury. Damage to the microvasculature of various organs leads to: Mild hypoxia to rapidly progressing respiratory failure. Depression of the central nervous system Petechial rashes Hemorrhagic lesions of the retina</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option   A: Acute respiratory distress syndrome is usually associated with pneumonia and sepsis. Option C: Pulmonary embolism usually occurs as a result of deep vein thrombosis of the leg. Dyspnea,syncope,hypotension and cyanosis are present in the present. Option D: Occult pneumothorax is a condition that is not suspected on the basis of the symptoms or plain radiography ,but is detected with CT. It usually follows a thoracic injury.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA According to Gurd and Wilson criteria this is the case of fat embolism as history of fracture is also be present.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Osteoarthritis The most likely diagnosis is osteoarthritis (OA) of the hand. In OA of the hand,the joints involved are the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints (DIP,PIP) and first carpometacarpal joint (base of the thumb), while the wrist,elbow and ankle are usually spared. The nodules palpable in the DIP are called Heberden\u2019s nodes,while those palpable in the PIP are called Bouchard\u2019s nodes.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Osteoarthritis predominantly involves the weight-bearing joints, including the knees, hips, cervical and lumbosacral spine, and feet. Other commonly affected joints include the distal interphalangeal (DIP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and carpometacarpal (CMC) joints. The thumb carpometacarpal joints are involved in 20% of hand OA, but the metacarpophalangeal joints and wrists are usually spared.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION B: Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. OPTION C: Psoriatic arthritis is a form of arthritis that affects some people who have psoriasis \u2014 a disease that causes red patches of skin topped with silvery scales. Most people develop psoriasis years before being diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. But for some, the joint problems begin before skin patches appear or at the same time. Joint pain, stiffness and swelling are the main signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis. They can affect any part of the body, including your fingertips and spine, and can range from relatively mild to severe. In both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, disease flares can alternate with periods of remission. OPTION D: Pseudogout is a disease that causes joint inflammation and arthritis. If someone develops pseudogout, they form and react to calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals. These crystals can deposit in the joints and soft tissues. Pseudogout is also called calcium pyrophosphate disease (CPPD). Chondrocalcinosis is another word used to describe these calcium crystals. It is considered a rheumatologic condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA JOINTS INVOLVED AND SPARED IN ARTHRITIS JOINT DISORDERS JOINTS COMMONLY INVOLVED JOINTS COMMONLY SPARED OSTEOARTHRITIS CERVICAL AND LUMBOSACRAL SPINE,PIP DIP,1ST CMC, HIP,KNEE,1ST MTP ELBOW,WRIST,ANKLE,MCP RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS SHOULDER,WRIST,MCP,PIP,KNEE,MTP DIP ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS SACROILIAC JOINT,INTERVERTEBRAL JOINTS PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS PIP,DIP RAY DISTRIBUTION RAY DISTRIBUTION: Joint involvement tends to follow a pattern with all of the joints of one finger involved sparing the adjacent finger completely.</p>\n<p></p>",
