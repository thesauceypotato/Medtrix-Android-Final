      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Rickets Rickets is a disease of growing bone that is unique to children and adolescents. It is caused by a failure of osteoid to calcify in a growing person. Osteoid throughout the skeleton is incompletely calci\ufb01ed, and the bone is therefore \u201csoftened.\u201d In children there are additional effects on physeal growth and ossi\ufb01cation, resulting in deformities of the endochondral skeleton (rickets). In active rickets there is thickening and widening of the growth plate, cupping of the metaphysis and, sometimes, bowing of the diaphysis. The metaphysis may remain abnormally wide.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The given X-ray shows genu varum which is most commonly seen in rickets.  In toddlers, bow leg or genu varum is one of the most common initial sign of rickets. In older children, genu valgum or coxa vara might be present. The characteristic features of rickets include: Delayed closure of the fontanelles Frontal bossing Craniotabes - soft skull bones Rickety rosary - enlargement of the costochondral junction Harrison sulcus Pigeon chest or pectus carinatum RADIOLOGICAL FEATURES Radiological features of rickets: Loss of provisional zone of calcification: earliest radiological finding of rickets. Delayed appearance of the epiphysis Widening of growth plate: normal width of growth is 2-4mm. It is increased in cases of rickets due to excessive accumulation of uncalcified osteoid at the growth plate. Cupping of metaphysis: normally metaphysis meets epiphysis as a smooth line of sclerosis. But in rickets the line is absent and the metaphyseal ends appear irregular and the cartilage accumulating in the growth plate creates a depression in the metaphysis causing cupping. Fraying: indistinct margins of the metaphysis Bowing of diaphysis, with thinning of cortices In healing rickets, Zone of calcification becomes denser.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - OPTION A,B AND C ARE NOT THE CORRECT ANSWER</p>\n<p></p>",
