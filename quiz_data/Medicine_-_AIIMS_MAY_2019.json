The three principal features of tamponade (Beck's triad) are hypotension, soft or absent heart sounds, and jugular venous distention with a prominent x (early systolic) descent but an absent y (early diastolic) descent. Paradoxical Pulse: This important clue to the presence of cardiac tamponade consists of a greater than normal (10 mmHg) inspiratory decline in systolic arterial pressure. When severe, it may be detected by palpating weakness or even the disappearance of the arterial pulse during inspiration. Because both ventricles share a tight incompressible covering, i.e..., the pericardial sac and the inspiratory enlargement of the right ventricle cause leftward bulging of the interventricular septum, reducing left ventricular volume, stroke volume, and arterial systolic pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Due to abnormality of the proteolipid protein (PLP1) gene locus at Xq22. The leopard skin sign (also knows as tigroid pattern or stripe sign) results from dark-spots or stripes (spared perivascular white matter) within bright demyelinated periventricular white matter on T2W images.
