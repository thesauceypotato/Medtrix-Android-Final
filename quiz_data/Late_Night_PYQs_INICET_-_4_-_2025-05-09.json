This can be identified based on the specific patterns observed in the EEG (Electroencephalogram), EMG (Electromyogram), and EOG (Electrooculogram) readings:</li><li>\u2022 EEG : The EEG during REM sleep shows low-amplitude, high-frequency waves that are similar to the wakeful state. This pattern is characteristic of REM sleep and is often described as \"sawtooth\" waves. EMG : The EMG during REM sleep shows a flat line, indicating muscle atonia. This muscle atonia is a defining feature of REM sleep, where most of the body's voluntary muscles are temporarily paralyzed. This prevents the sleeper from acting out their dreams. EOG : The EOG during REM sleep shows rapid movements of the eyes, which is where REM sleep gets its name. These rapid eye movements are indicative of the intense brain activity occurring during this stage, despite the body's overall lack of movement.</li><li>\u2022 EEG : The EEG during REM sleep shows low-amplitude, high-frequency waves that are similar to the wakeful state.

NREM 3 : Known as slow-wave sleep or deep sleep, NREM 3 is characterized by high-amplitude, low-frequency delta waves on the EEG.
