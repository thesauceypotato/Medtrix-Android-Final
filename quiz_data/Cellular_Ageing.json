Factors leading to cellular ageing- Damaged DNA causes mutations. Damage of proteins causing misfolding of proteins. Plasma membrane damage is caused by phospholipid damage. Lipid peroxidation and injury by free radicals .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Telomere attrition in ageing: One mechanism of replicative senescence involves the progressive shortening of telomeres , which ultimately results in cell cycle arrest . When somatic cells replicate , a small section of the telomere is not duplicated and telomeres become progressively shortened . As the telomeres become shorter, the ends of chromosomes cannot be protected and are seen as broken DNA, which signals cell cycle arrest. Telomere length is maintained by nucleotide addition mediated by an enzyme called telomerase . Telomerase is RNA-dependant DNA polymerase which adds DNA to the 3\u2019 end of the chromosome to avoid loss of genetic material with every duplication.
