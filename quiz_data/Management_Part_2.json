Fibroadenoma in a young patient with no other history is best managed with reassurance . On USG fibroadenomas have smooth contours, round or oval shapes, weak internal echoes, and well-defined anterior and posterior margins. With short-term follow-up, a significant percentage of fibroadenomas decrease in size and are no longer palpable. Only observation & reassurance is required .

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Mastectomy f/b Radiotherapy The given scenario is of Malignant Phyllodes Tumor It is a benign tumour, previously sometimes known as Cystosarcoma phyllodes. Usually occurs in women over the age of 40 years but can appear in younger women. Presents as a large , sometimes massive, tumour with an unevenly bosselated surface. Different entities called Benign phyllodes tumours, Borderline phyllodes tumours, & Malignant phyllodes tumours are known. Treatment of Malignant Disease: Complete surgical excision of the entire tumour with a margin of normal tissue is advised In a large tumour total mastectomy is recommended Radiation therapy is recommended if- Margins are concerning or close, if the tumour involves the fascia or chest wall, if the tumour is very large (>5 cm), or If else only wide local excision is performed. Mastectomy f/b Adjuvant Radiotherapy is the best Treatment for this Patient.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Phyllodes tumour is a rare (< 1% of all breast tumours), large(>3cm), rapidly growing, discrete and firm painless breast lump. They are usually benign, but most of them have malignant potential. They originate from the hormonally responsive stromal cells of the breast. Clinical features: Large breast with the unevenly bosselated surface. Pressure necrosis may cause skin ulceration. They are mobile on the chest wall Mostly seen in 40\u201350 years (premenopausal) age. Phyllodes tumours are fibroepithelial tumours composed of epithelial and stromal components. Biopsy shows a leaf-like appearance under the microscope.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A . Wide Local Excision in a large tumour is not sufficient and must be accompanied by Radiotherapy. Option: B . Mastectomy is done in this case, with Adjuvant Radiotherapy as Size >5cm Option: C . Systemic therapy is not successful in Phyllodes.</p>\n<p></p>",

The Radical Halsted Mastectomy includes excision of the breast, nipple-areola complex, axillary lymph nodes and pectoralis major and minor muscles. It is not done nowadays. Statement 3 . Simple mastectomy involves the removal of only the breast with no dissection of the axilla. LN dissection is not a concern here. Statement 4 . Breast-Conserving Surgery involves the removal of the only tumour plus a margin of normal breast tissue. These operations are usually combined with axillary surgery, usually via a separate incision in the axilla. Sentinel LN Biopsy, & removal of Level 2, or Level 3 LN is also done.</p>\n<p></p>",
