It needs amyl nitrite, sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulphate.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Treatment of cyanide poisoning The principle of the treatment is to reverse the cyanide-cytochrome This is achieved by converting hemoglobin to methemoglobin by giving nitrites. Methaemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide than the cytochrome oxidase  complex, and removes cyanide from the cytochrome oxidase. Cyanides combine with methaemoglobin and form non-toxic cyanmethemoglobin which in the presence of rhodanase  and sulphate donors, such as thiosulphate, converts cyanide  to thiocyanate which is excreted in the urine. Cyanide is directly converted to thiocyanate by the complexing of cyanide  with thiosulphate under the influence of the enzyme rhodanase. Cyanide is also converted to cyanocobalamin (Vit B 12 ) by complexing with hydroxocobalamin (Vit B 12 A).

The procedure should be performed by a competent physician and only in extreme cases by another qualified health care worker. The convictions of both the physician and the patient should be respected. Patients must be supported appropriately and provided with necessary medical and psychological treatment along with appropriate counseling if desired. Physicians have a right to conscientious objection to performing an abortion; therefore, they may withdraw while ensuring the continuity of medical care by a qualified colleague.

The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given consent.

The inner table is unsupported and a cone-shaped piece of bone is detached  forming a crater that is larger than the hole on the outer table, and shows bevelling (sloping surface). Fissured fractures often radiate from the defect. As the bone fragments have to pass through the dura before entering  the brain, lacerations are usually irregular and involve At the point of exit, a punched-out opening is produced in the inner table and beveled opening on the outer table. The wound is funnel-shaped, with the funnel opening up in the direction in which the bullet is traveling both in the entrance  and exit wound. Bevelling is produced when the unsupported diploe everts and fragments on the side where the bullet leaves,  this in contrast to the approach side where the rim of the defect is  supported by the underlying bone.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1-ii, 2-i, 3-iv, 4-v Transvestism or eonism A transvestite (trans = opposite; vesta = clothing) is a person whose whole personality is dominated by the desire to be identified and thought of as a member of the opposite sex. His dress, manner, occupational interests and associations are all designed to increase his feeling of being a woman. Sexuality with him is relatively unimportant except as it promotes his feelings of femininity. It is usually found in the males who obtain sexual pleasure by wearing female dress. Psychologically, it may depend upon an individual's erotic attraction for the opposite sex. Necrophilia In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies. It is said to have a sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell, and coldness act as stimulants. The offense is usually committed on a newly buried corpse or a body awaiting burial. The corpse may be mutilated following intercourse. Murder for the purpose of necrophilia is very rare. Necrophilia and necrophagia are punishable under S. 297 IPC (BNS 301) with imprisonment up to one year and/or fine. Frotteurism: Frotteurism (frottage: toucherism) is contact with another person in order to obtain sexual satisfaction. Sexual satisfaction is obtained by rubbing his private parts against a female's buttocks, thighs, breasts or genital area in crowds. Fantasy is an extensive component, i.e. they think that touching behavior will not offend victims and also victims will find it pleasurable. If they attempt intercourse, they have a premature ejaculation or they are impotent. It is an uncommon perversion and rarely occurs alone. It is an obscene act punishable under S. 294, I.P.C. (BNS 296) with imprisonment up to three months and/or fine up to Rs 1000. Algolagnia In algolagnia, pleasure is obtained by inflicting pain on self or partner. Active algolagnia or sadism In sadism, sexual gratification is obtained or increased from acts of physical cruelty or infliction of  pain upon one's partner. It is seen more commonly in men. To obtain sexual gratification the sadist may bite, beat, whip, produce cuts, cigarette burns, etc., or ill-treat or torture his  sexual partner in many other cruel ways. Passive algolagnia or masochism In masochism, sexual gratification is obtained or increased by the  suffering of pain. Masochists get pleasure from being beaten, abused, tortured, humiliated, enslaved, degraded or dominated by  their sexual partner, and they tend to place themselves repeatedly  in self-defeating situations. Such painful stimuli may entirely replace the ordinary sex stimuli. It is usually found in males but it may be found in females, who may willingly expose themselves  to the risks of severe bodily injury or murder at the hands of brutal  husbands or lovers.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. 1-iv, 2-iii, 3-i, 4-v This is not the right match.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Barium carbonate Barium causes hypokalemia and cardiac arrhythmia.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Barium Mechanism of action Barium induces hypokalemia by two mechanisms: It competitively blocks potassium channels, which are responsible for the efflux of intracellular K+ out of the cell. Directly decreases cell membrane permeability to Na+. This leads to a shift of extracellular potassium into the cell. Intracellular trapping of K+ leads to (i) depolarization and paralysis (ii) decreases vascular resistance and reduces blood flow, hypertension and lactic acidosis. Direct toxicity to skeletal muscle and neuromuscular transmission. Hypokalemia occurs within 2 hours of exposure.

Zinc phosphide Symptoms are similar to those of aluminum phosphide, but are usually slower to start because of the slow release of phosphine. Option: D. Warfarin tablets Warfarin competitively inhibits the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1), an essential enzyme for activating the vitamin K available in the body. Through this mechanism, warfarin can deplete functional vitamin K reserves and thereby reduce the synthesis of active clotting factors.</p>\n<p></p>",
