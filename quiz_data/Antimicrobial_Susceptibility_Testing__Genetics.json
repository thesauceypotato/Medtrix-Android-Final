It uses antibiotic discs to test the extent to which bacteria are affected by those antibiotics . In Kirby-Bauer testing, the lawn culture of the test organism is plated on a solid growth medium and antibiotics disks are placed onto this plate. After allowing the bacteria to grow overnight, areas of clear media (zone of inhibition) surrounding the disks indicate that the antibiotic inhibits bacterial growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B.

Broth dilution is a technique in which containers holding identical volumes of broth with an anti-microbial solution in incrementally (usually geometrically) increasing concentration are inoculated. Option D. Agar dilution method involves the incorporation of varying desired concentrations of the antimicrobial agent into an agar medium (molten agar medium), habitually using serial two-fold dilutions, followed by the inoculation of a defined microbial inoculum onto the agar plate surface.</p>\n<p></p>",

A plasmid is a floating piece of circular DNA in the bacteria separate from its own DNA. During bacterial conjugation, the \"donor\" bacteria donates to the \"recipient\" bacteria new genetic information that may contain genes such as resistance to certain antibiotics.
