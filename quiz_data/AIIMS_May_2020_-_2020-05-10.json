The MMA enters the middle cranial fossa by passing through the foramen spinosum. After entering the skull, it courses laterally to the pterion.</li><li>\u2022 Given the proximity of the MMA to the pterion, trauma to this region can lead to an extradural (epidural) hematoma if the MMA is torn. This is because the MMA runs just deep to the pterion, between the skull and the dura mater.</li><li>\u2022 This makes the MMA the artery most closely related to the pterion, and a fracture at the pterion can lead to rupture of this artery.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options :</li><li>\u2022 Other Options</li><li>\u2022 Option A .

Tuberculomas are focal infections that typically present as ring-enhancing lesions in the brain, often around the brainstem, and can conglomerate. The lipid-lactate peak on MR spectroscopy is indicative of necrosis, which is a feature seen in tuberculomas (and also in conditions like toxoplasmosis). The combination of imaging and spectroscopy findings helps distinguish tuberculomas from other similar conditions.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

Extension and lateral rotation</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The gluteal tuberosity is indicated by the marked area in the photograph. The gluteus maximus, which is implanted here, produces lateral rotation and extension of the hip joint. Extension involves increasing the angle between the femur and the pelvis, essentially the opposite of flexion. Lateral rotation, refers to turning the anterior aspect of the femur away from the midline.</li><li>\u2022 Three-quarters of the gluteus maximus attach to the iliotibial tract, while one-fourth attach to the gluteal tuberosity (marked in image). The inferior gluteal nerve supplies it. At the hip joint, it serves as the primary extensor of the lower limb.

Instead, other muscles, such as the iliopsoas and anterior fibers of the gluteus medius and minimus, play roles in hip flexion and medial rotation.</li><li>\u2022 Flexion is the movement of bending the joint, resulting in a decrease of the angle between the femur and the pelvis.

However, sympathetic fibers that come from the chain (e.g., the carotid plexus) do accompany structures within the sheath, especially the internal and common carotid arteries.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
