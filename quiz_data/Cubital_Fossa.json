      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Antecubital vein The concept for Correct Option- For direct blood investigations, the antecubital vein (median cubital vein) is typically the vein of choice. Antecubital Vein At the roof of the cubital fossa, the median cubital vein connects the cephalic vein with the basilic vein. It is easily accessible because it lies superficial to the bicipital aponeurosis. It is used for IV injections, blood transfusions, and blood withdrawal.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Content from medial to lateral (mnemonic \u2013 MBBR) Median Nerve Brachial Artery Biceps Tendon Radial Nerve</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. The cephalic vein, which begins as a radial extension of the dorsal venous arch and travels over the roof of the anatomical snuffbox, is a radial continuation of the dorsal venous arch. It comes to an end in the axillary vein. The median cubital vein connects it to the basilic vein. It's the best place to put a short-term IV cannula. Option: C. The basilic vein passes through the medial portion of the forearm , draining the ulnar end of the dorsal venous arch. At the lower boundary of the teres major, it pierces the deep fascia at the elbow and joins the venue commutants of the brachial artery to produce the axillary vein. Option: D.  The brachial vein is a deep forearm vein that runs parallel to the brachial artery on both sides. It is generated by connecting the radial and ulnar arteries at their junctions. At the lower boundary of the teres major, it connects the axillary vein.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Clinical Correlations Supracondylar Fracture may lead to posterior displacement of the distal fragment of humerus as well as the radius and ulna.
