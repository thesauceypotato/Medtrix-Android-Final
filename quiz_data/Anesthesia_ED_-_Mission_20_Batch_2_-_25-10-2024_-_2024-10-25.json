It fills with air or oxygen from an attached reservoir or oxygen supply. Expiratory Valve : This allows the exhaled gas to escape the system so that it doesn\u2019t re-enter the patient\u2019s lungs. PEEP Valve : Stands for Positive End-Expiratory Pressure valve , which maintains a small amount of pressure in the lungs to keep the alveoli open at the end of exhalation . Face Mask : Fits over the patient\u2019s nose and mouth to deliver breaths directly into the lungs. Pop-off Valve : A safety feature that prevents the delivery of excessively high pressures which could damage the patient\u2019s lungs. Oxygen Inlet & Tubing : Connects the bag to an oxygen supply to deliver oxygen-enriched air to the patient. Reservoir Bag : Allows a reservoir of oxygen to be available for the patient to ensure the highest possible concentration of oxygen is delivered. Air-inlet One-way Valve & O2 Reservoir Socket : Prevents room air from entering the bag when attached to an oxygen supply and allows for the connection of an oxygen reservoir .</li><li>\u2022 Self-inflating Bag : This component allows the bag to reinflate after being squeezed , without requiring a gas supply .
