The response to iron therapy varies, depending on the erythropoietin stimulus and the rate of absorption. Typically, the reticulocyte count begins to increase within 4\u20137 days after initiation of therapy but it peaks at around 1\u20131\u00bd weeks. Oral iron preparations should be taken on an empty stomach, since food may inhibit iron absorption. Iron replacement therapy, up to 200 mg of elemental iron per day is given, This supports a red cell production level of two to three times normal in an individual with a normally functioning marrow and appropriate erythropoietin (EPO) stimulus. Of the complications of oral iron therapy, gastrointestinal distress is the most prominent and is seen in at least 15\u201320% of patients in the form of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or constipation. The absence of a response may be due to poor absorption, noncompliance or a confounding diagnosis.</p>\n<p></p>",
