The dose can be adjusted based on the plasma concentration.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Therapeutic index Therapeutic index refers to the relationship between toxic and therapeutic dose. Therapeutic index = TD 50 / ED 50 Where: TD50 is the dose of drug that causes a toxic response in 50% of the population and ED50 is the dose of drug that is therapeutically effective in 50% of the population. Therapeutic window \u2013 range of plasma concentration ranging from minimum effective concentration to minimum toxic concentration</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A . Therapeutic window is testing that measures the amount of certain medicines in your blood . It is done to make sure the amount of medicine you are taking is both safe and effective. Most medicines can be dosed correctly without special testing. Option: B. The therapeutic index (TI; also referred to as therapeutic ratio) is a quantitative measurement of the relative safety of a drug. It is a comparison of the amount of a therapeutic agent that causes the therapeutic effect to the amount that causes toxicity. The related terms therapeutic window</p>\n<p></p>",
