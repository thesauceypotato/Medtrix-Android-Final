In the case of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS), sodium and glucose are absorbed together through the Sodium Glucose Linked Transporter (SGLT-1) in the intestines. This is an example of secondary active transport because it relies on the electrochemical gradient of sodium, which is maintained by primary active transport systems like the sodium-potassium pump. Cotransporters can be classified as symporters and antiporters depending on whether the substances move in the same or opposite directions.</li><li>\u2022 Co-transport refers to the process where two substances are simultaneously transported across a membrane in the same direction by a single protein, or symporter.

The correct sequence begins with the contraction of the ischiocavernosus muscle, which aids in the erection of the penis by compressing the base of the penile shaft and obstructing blood flow out of the erect penis, thereby maintaining its rigidity. Following this, the bulbospongiosus muscle contracts, which propels the seminal fluid along the urethra.
