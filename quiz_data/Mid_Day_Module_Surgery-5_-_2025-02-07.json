The lymphatic drainage of the testes is to the para-aortic lymph nodes near the origin of the gonadal vessels. The contralateral para-aortic lymph nodes are sometimes involved by tumour spread, but the inguinal lymph nodes are affected only if the scrotal skin is involved. Teratomas consist of different tissues derived from ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. Immature components are often neuroectodermal or mesenchymal tissue, while more mature tissue is often cystic with epithelial differentiation or consists of smooth muscle, connective tissue or cartilage. All can metastasise. Choriocarcinoma. This is part of a testicular GCT in 25% of tumours in adults. It very seldom appears as the single tumour component.
