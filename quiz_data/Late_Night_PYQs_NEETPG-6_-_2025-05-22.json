The primary cause of pregnancy loss in APS is believed to be due to inhibition of trophoblast function and differentiation, which leads to placental dysfunction. The best management approach for pregnant women with APS includes: Low dose aspirin : Initiated as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Aspirin helps by preventing platelet aggregation and improving blood flow to the placenta. Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) : Started once fetal cardiac activity is detected. LMWH helps prevent blood clot formation, thus reducing the risk of thrombosis and improving pregnancy outcomes.</li><li>\u2022 Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent pregnancy loss, thrombosis, and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies.</li><li>\u2022 The primary cause of pregnancy loss in APS is believed to be due to inhibition of trophoblast function and differentiation, which leads to placental dysfunction.</li><li>\u2022 The best management approach for pregnant women with APS includes: Low dose aspirin : Initiated as soon as pregnancy is confirmed.

Vomiting: Severe vomiting that precedes the onset of pain, leading to esophageal rupture. Dyspnea or Shortness of Breath: Due to leakage of air and fluids into the chest cavity, causing pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Subcutaneous Emphysema: Air leaks from the esophagus into the chest wall, causing a characteristic crackling sensation when the skin is palpated. Shock: Severe cases may lead to shock due to sepsis or hypovolemia.

It is the major pulmonary surfactant (surfactant is a surface-active agent, secreted by type II alveolar epithelial cells) It is a complex mixture of several phospholipids, proteins, and ions. The most important components are the phospholipid dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, surfactant apoproteins, and calcium ions. The surfactant decreases the surface tension in the alveoli 2- to 10-fold, which normally plays a major role in preventing alveolar collapse. However, in a number of conditions, such as in hyaline membrane disease (also called respiratory distress syndrome), which often occurs in newborn premature babies, the quantity of surfactant secreted by the alveoli is so greatly depressed that the surface tension of the alveolar fluid becomes several times normal. This causes a serious tendency for the lungs of these babies to collapse or to become filled with fluid.
