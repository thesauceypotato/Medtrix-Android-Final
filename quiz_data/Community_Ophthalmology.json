Timolol: It is a nonselective beta-1 and beta-2 blocker. It is available as 0.25% and 0.5% eye drops. Option: B. Prazosin: Prazosin inhibits the postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenoceptors. This inhibition blocks the vasoconstricting (narrowing) effect of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) on the vessels, leading to peripheral blood vessel dilation. Option: D.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Trachoma. Follicles: Hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue Generally seen in viral or chlamydial conditions Smooth, pale, pink-to-yellow, elevated lesions surrounded by displaced vessels Trachoma is nearly always a disease of the superior conjunctiva. This is in stark contrast to inclusion conjunctivitis, another chlamydial disease, which is more severe inferiorly. Toxic follicular conjunctivitis secondary to medications and viral keratoconjunctivitis are also more severe.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Ocular Infections caused by Chlamydia</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Chlamydia inclusion conjunctivitis is generally spread by sexual transmission from a genital reservoir of infection. In adults, the organism may be transferred from the genitals by the fingers, but a common mode of infection is through the water in swimming pools; thus, the disease may occur in local epidemics (swimming pool conjunctivitis). It is also commonly transmitted from the mother to the newborn when follicle formation is less evident. Inclusion conjunctivitis is characteristically acute at the onset. The incubation period varies from 5 to 10 days. The follicular hypertrophy is always more prominent in the lower lid than in the upper, although in acute cases, the follicles may be partially obscured by papillary hypertrophy. The exudate, composed principally of neutrophils, may be moderately abundant. The cornea is involved in a superficial punctate keratitis Option: B. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is a type of acute follicular conjunctivitis mostly associated with superficial punctate keratitis and usually occurs in epidemics, hence the name EKC. Pseudomembrane lining the lower fornix and palpebral conjunctiva may be formed in about 3 percent patients with severe inflammation. Follicles of small to moderate size, typically involving the lower fornix and palpebral conjunctiva, form the characteristic feature. Option: D. Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome is a rare condition of chronic low-grade fever, unilateral granulomatous conjunctivitis as seen in the figure with surrounding follicles, and ipsilateral regional (preauricular) lymphadenopathy. It is synonymous with cat scratch disease, although several other causes have been implicated, including tularaemia, insect hairs (ophthalmia nodosa), Treponema Pallidum, sporotrichosis, tuberculosis, and acute C. trachomatis infection.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>I-c, II-b, III-a At a later stage of trachoma , trachomatous pannus develops as a lymphoid infiltration with vascularization of the margin of the cornea, usually limited to the upper half as seen in the figure but tending to spread towards the centre and to involve the whole cornea. The upper part of the margin of the cornea becomes cloudy, and minute superficial vessels, springing from the corneal loops, grow inwards towards the centre. Progressive pannus In progressive pannus, the vessels are mostly parallel to each other and directed vertically downwards, anastomosing little. They extend to a level which forms a horizontal line, beyond which there is a narrow strip of infiltration and haze. Regressive pannus In regressive pannus, the infiltration shows evidence of receding so that the vessels extend a short distance beyond the infiltrated and hazy area. This difference is useful in estimating the results of treatment. Corneal ulcers Corneal ulcers, which may be chronic, occur anywhere but are commonest at the advancing edge of the pannus. They are shallow, a little infiltrated, and cause much lacrimation and photophobia. The pannus may resolve completely, leaving the cornea quite clear apart from the obliterated vessels if treated early, when the pannus has not destroyed Bowman's membrane.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Grading of trachoma McCallan's classification divided the clinical course of the trachoma into four stages: Stage I (Incipient trachoma or stage of infiltration) . It is characterized by hyperaemia of the palpebral conjunctiva and immature follicles. Stage II (Established trachoma or stage of florid infiltration) . It is characterized by the appearance of mature follicles, papillae and progressive corneal pannus. Stage III (Cicatrising trachoma or stage of scarring) . It includes obvious scarring of the palpebral conjunctiva. Stage IV (Healed trachoma or stage of sequelae) . The disease is quiet and cured, but sequelae due to cicatrisation give rise to symptoms.</p>\n<p></p>",
