This protein is highly expressed in barrier tissues such as the intestinal epithelium, blood-brain barrier, and liver, where it limits the absorption of drugs and enhances their excretion, contributing to drug resistance. By actively pumping drugs out of cells, P-gp decreases their therapeutic effectiveness, particularly in cancer treatments. The incorrect statement suggests that P-gp facilitates drug entry into cells, which is not true; instead, it works to expel drugs, reducing their absorption.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. P-glycoprotein functions as a drug efflux pump that reduces intracellular drug accumulation: This statement is correct as P-glycoprotein's primary role is to expel drugs from cells, reducing their intracellular concentration.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. P-glycoprotein functions as a drug efflux pump that reduces intracellular drug accumulation:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. P-glycoprotein is highly expressed in tissues with barrier functions, such as the blood-brain barrier and intestinal epithelium: This statement is correct because P-glycoprotein is prominently located in tissues with barrier functions, helping to limit drug absorption and facilitate excretion.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. P-glycoprotein is highly expressed in tissues with barrier functions, such as the blood-brain barrier and intestinal epithelium:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein enhances the effectiveness of certain chemotherapeutic agents by increasing their intracellular concentration: This statement is accurate because inhibiting P-gp prevents drug efflux, thereby enhancing drug retention within cells and improving the effectiveness of chemotherapy.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein enhances the effectiveness of certain chemotherapeutic agents by increasing their intracellular concentration:</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 P-glycoprotein is a key efflux pump that reduces the intracellular concentration of drugs by actively pumping them out of cells, contributing to drug resistance, especially in cancer treatment.

Vitamin K plays a crucial role in the synthesis of several clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) and, therefore, is generally associated with promoting coagulation rather than inhibiting it.
