      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Impairment of receptor of IGF-1 Septic patients exhibit insulin resistance and hyperglycemia . Cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 , stress-induced hormones (such as glucagon , growth hormone , and glucocorticoids ), and catecholamines all drive gluconeogenesis. At the same time, the pro-inflammatory cytokines suppress insulin release while simultaneously promoting insulin resistance in the liver and other tissues, likely by impairing the surface expression of GLUT-4, a glucose transporter . Hyperglycemia decreases neutrophil function\u2014thereby suppressing bactericidal activity\u2014and causes increased adhesion molecule expression on endothelial cells. Although sepsis is initially associated with an acute surge in glucocorticoid production , this phase may be followed by adrenal insufficiency and a functional deficit of glucocorticoids . This may stem from depression of the synthetic capacity of intact adrenal glands or frank adrenal necrosis resulting from DIC ( Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome )\u2014finally, cellular hypoxia and diminished oxidative phosphorylation lead to increased lactate production and lactic acidosis .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Shock is a state of circulatory failure that impairs tissue perfusion and leads to cellular hypoxia .
