      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression Occurs depending both on the dose and duration of therapy . In time, the adrenal cortex atrophies. Stoppage of exogenous steroid precipitated withdrawal syndrome consisting of malaise, fever, anorexia, nausea, postural hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, weakness, pain in muscles and joints, and reactivation of the disease for which the steroid was used. Subjected to stress, these patients may go into acute adrenal insufficiency leading to cardiovascular collapse.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>HPA axis suppression riskoccurs in the person receiving Hydrocortisone 20-25mg/day or equivalent for longer than 2-3 weeks . Such patients may need protection with a corticosteroid (oral or i.v.) if a stressful situation develops up to one year after withdrawal. Administration of ACTH during withdrawal does not hasten recovery because it has been found that adrenals recover earlier than the pituitary and hypothalamus. If a patient on corticosteroid therapy develops an infection -the steroid should not be discontinued despite its propensity to weaken host defense and delay healing. Rather, the dose may have to be increased to meet the stress of infection. Surgery in such a patient should be covered by intraoperative and postoperative i.v. hydrocortisone till the condition stabilizes, followed by oral prednisolone. Measures that minimize HPA axis suppression are: Use shorter-acting steroids (hydrocortisone, prednisolone) at the lowest possible dose. Use steroids for the shortest period of time possible. Give the entire daily dose at one time in the morning. Switch to alternate-day therapy if the condition does not deteriorate on the \u2018off\u2019 day. It has been found that a moderate dose of a short-acting steroid (e.g. prednisolone) given at 48 hr intervals did not cause HPA suppression, whereas the same total amount given in 4 divided 12 hourly doses produced marked HPA suppression. Alternate-day therapy also resulted in less immunological suppression -lower risk of The longer-acting steroids (dexamethasone , etc.) are not suitable for alternate-day therapy. The only problem with alternate-day therapy is that many steroid-dependent patients are incapacitated on the \u2018off day\u2019. If appropriate, use local (dermal, inhaled, ocular, nasal, rectal, intrasynovial) preparations of a steroid with poor systemic availability (beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide, fluticasone, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Insulin-like effects-Glucocorticoids precipitate insulin resistance and hyperglycemia - anti insulin-like effects. Option: B. Hematopoiesis in the bone marrow- Glucocorticoid increases the number of RBC, platelets, and neutrophils, hence useful in treating This is not an adverse effect seen on discontinuation of corticosteroids. Option: C. Osteoporosis can occur after long-term glucocorticoid therapy, not as a sudden stoppage of glucocorticoid.</p>\n<p></p>",
