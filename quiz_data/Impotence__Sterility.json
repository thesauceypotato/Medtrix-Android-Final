      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Consent of the husband is sufficient for this procedure Consent of husband and wife is required for this procedure</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Types of artificial insemination If the semen of the woman's husband is used, it is known as 'artificial insemination homologous' or \"artificial insemination husband\" (A.I.H). If the semen of some person other than the husband is used, it is known as an \"artificial insemination donor\" (A.I.D). 'Pooled' donor semen is composed of donor semen to which semen from the husband has been added (A.l.H.D.). Option: C. Biological Aspects: Semen is obtained by masturbation and one ml. is deposited by means of a syringe in or near the cervix. The timing of insemination is important as the lifespan of the spermatozoa in the female reproductive tract is short. The ovum can survive in a fertilized form only for about 24 hours, and probably only for 8 to 12 hours after it leaves the ovary. The time of maximum fertility coincides with ovulation. The ovum can survive in a fertilized form for 8 to 12 hours after it leaves the ovary. The usual time taken by sperm to travel from the vagina to the tubes is 6 to 24 hours. The power of sperm to fertilize is usually retained for about 48 hours. Because of the problem of timing, insemination on several successive days in the month increases the chances of pregnancy. The use of frozen semen for AI. D. is becoming increasingly common. This is done by the addition of glycerol, slow cooling, rapid freezing, and storage below minus 79 degree C. Option: B & D. Indications: When the husband is impotent. When the husband is unable to deposit the semen in the vagina due to hypospadias, epispadias, etc. When the husband is sterile. When there is Rh incompatibility between the husband and wife. When the husband is suffering from a hereditary disease. Precautions: Certain recommendations have been made when a donor is used. They are : The consent of the donor and his wife is essential. The identity of the donor must remain secret. The donor should not know to whom the semen is donated and the result of insemination. The donor must be mentally and physically healthy and should not be suffering from any hereditary or familial disease. He should be screened with all available tests including chromosomal studies for possible genetic defects. The donor must not be a relative of either spouse, he should have had children of his own. The race and characteristics of the donor should resemble those of the husband of the woman as closely as possible. The donor should be of the same blood group as that of the husband There should not be any Rh incompatibility between the donor and recipient. The physician should have permission to use his own best judgement in selecting the donor. The couple should be psychologically fit and emotionally stable. The woman to be inseminated and her husband must give consent in writing that an unknown donor should be used. A witness must be present when insemination is done. It is usually wise to use \"pooled\" semen. When the husband's semen is mixed with that of a donor, there is the technical possibility that the husband may, in fact, be the father of the child. The physician who administers artificial insemination should avoid delivering the child. This will avoid the necessity of either falsifying the birth records or disclosing the true paternity in those records. Usually, a single donor's semen is not used to produce more than ten children.</p>\n<p></p>",

Psychic factors may lead to impotence commonly in males. In males, the impotence is passive leading to non-erection, but in females it is of an active nature, leading to vaginismus. Vaginismus is a spasmodic contraction of the vagina due to hyperaesthesia. It is a classical example of a psychosomatic illness. Anatomically, it may affect the perineal muscles exclusively or may be felt as a varying constriction of the levator ani, right up to the vaginal Fornices. Any attempt at intercourse will cause painful reflex spasm of the levator ani, perineal muscles, adductor muscles of thighs and erector spinae muscles Option: D. Emotional disturbances are a common cause of temporary impotence. Fear of impotence or fear of inability to complete the act (first-night impotence/honeymoon impotence in the bridegroom) is common cause of temporary impotence but usually, they are soon overcome. Disgust of the sexual act or dislike of the partner may cause temporary or permanent impotence. Anxiety, guilt sense, timidity, depression, excessive passion, and sexual overindulgence produce temporary impotence. Quoad hoc (as far as this) is an individual who may be impotent with one particular woman but not with others. Nocturnal penile tumescence has revealed that a majority of cases of impotence have organic causes. Vasculogenic impotence is one of the most frequent causes of erectile failure. Vasculogenic impotence may be due to poor arterial inflow into the penis due to arteriosclerotic narrowing of the arteries supplying the penis</p>\n<p></p>",
