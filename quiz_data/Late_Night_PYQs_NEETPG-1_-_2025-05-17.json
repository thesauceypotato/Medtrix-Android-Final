It outlines how the body responds to any demand (stressor) placed upon it, regardless of whether the stressor is physical, psychological, or environmental. The GAS consists of three stages: alarm reaction (fight-or-flight response), resistance (adaptation), and exhaustion. It represents a general biological response to stress rather than being specific to any particular psychiatric condition.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Panic Attacks (Incorrect) : While panic attacks involve physiological stress responses, they represent a specific type of anxiety response rather than the general stress response described by GAS. Panic attacks are acute episodes characterized by intense fear and specific physical symptoms like palpitations, sweating, and shortness of breath. Option B. Depression (Incorrect) : Depression represents a mood disorder with persistent low mood, anhedonia, and other emotional and physical symptoms. While chronic stress can contribute to depression, and there may be HPA axis dysregulation in depression, GAS describes the general stress response rather than the specific pathophysiology of depression. Option C. Anxiety Disorders (Incorrect) : Anxiety disorders involve excessive worry, fear, and physiological arousal. While anxiety certainly involves stress response systems, GAS describes the broader physiological response to any stressor, not just anxiety disorders.</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

In this case, the woman engages in repetitive handwashing (compulsion) likely in response to obsessive thoughts about contamination. Response Prevention involves preventing the person from performing the compulsive behavior (handwashing) when they feel the urge.

Unlike SERMs, fulvestrant has no agonist activity in any tissue. It binds to estrogen receptors and causes their degradation, preventing estrogen receptor dimerization so that ER interaction with DNA is prevented. The ER is thus down-regulated, resulting in complete suppression of estrogen-responsive gene function.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Raloxifene - This is incorrect. Raloxifene is a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM) that exhibits tissue-selective effects. It acts as an estrogen receptor agonist in bone (increasing bone formation and preventing osteoporosis) and blood vessels (improving lipid profile), but acts as an antagonist in breast and endometrial tissues. Option B. Tamoxifen - This is incorrect. Tamoxifen is also a SERM with mixed agonist and antagonist effects. It acts as an antagonist in breast tissue (making it useful for breast cancer treatment) but has estrogenic effects on the endometrium, which can increase the risk of endometrial proliferation and cancer. Option D. Clomiphene - This is incorrect. Clomiphene is a SERM that acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist in the pituitary, which blocks estrogenic feedback inhibition of gonadotropin secretion. This leads to increased FSH and LH secretion, stimulating ovulation. It's used to treat anovulatory infertility.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Raloxifene - This is incorrect.

However, with modern modified ECT using muscle relaxants, this risk is significantly reduced. Option B. Benzodiazepines should be discontinued prior to ECT (Correct) : Benzodiazepines should be discontinued before ECT because they have anticonvulsant properties that can raise the seizure threshold and potentially interfere with the therapeutic efficacy of ECT by reducing seizure duration.

Earlier, raised intracranial pressure was considered an absolute contraindication for ECT, but no longer. The main side effect is memory disturbance, particularly retrograde amnesia, which is usually temporary. Modern modified ECT using anaesthesia and muscle relaxants has significantly improved the safety profile of this effective treatment for severe depression, catatonia, and certain other psychiatric conditions.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

An axillary temperature of 37.5\u00b0C represents a normal body temperature and falls below the fever threshold of \u226538.0\u00b0C, which would indicate infection. A temperature between 36.5\u00b0C and 37.5\u00b0C is considered normal and would not trigger the \"fever\" classification in the IMNCI assessment.</li><li>\u2022 The WHO IMNCI classification system specifically designates fever as temperature \u226538\u00b0C when assessing for possible severe bacterial infection. Without other clinical signs, a temperature of 37.5\u00b0C alone would be classified as \"no fever\" and would not meet criteria for antibiotic therapy or referral.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 50 breaths per minute or more - This is a danger sign in IMNCI assessment. The age-specific respiratory rate cutoffs (\u226560/min for <2 months; \u226550/min for 2-12 months) define fast breathing, which is classified as pneumonia requiring antibiotic therapy or severe pneumonia if accompanied by chest indrawing.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 50 breaths per minute or more</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 10 or more skin pustules - This IS considered a sign of possible severe bacterial infection. The IMNCI guidelines classify multiple skin pustules or a large skin infection as requiring systemic antibiotics due to risk of invasive bacterial disease.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 10 or more skin pustules</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Temperature less than 35.5\u00b0C - This IS a critical danger sign. Hypothermia in young infants strongly suggests sepsis and represents impaired thermoregulation. IMNCI classifies temperature <35.5\u00b0C as a danger sign requiring immediate referral after pre-referral antibiotics.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Temperature less than 35.5\u00b0C</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 In IMNCI assessment, normal temperature (36.5-37.5\u00b0C) does not trigger concern for severe bacterial infection, while fast breathing (age-specific rates), multiple skin infections, and hypothermia (<35.5\u00b0C) all represent important clinical signs requiring prompt antibiotic therapy and possible referral.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
