      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. D. Radial artery</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The Radial artery is the preferred site for invasive blood pressure monitoring for several reasons:</li><li>\u2022 preferred site</li><li>\u2022 Accessibility : The radial artery is superficial and is easily accessible . This makes cannulation of the radial artery relatively straightforward . Collateral Blood Flow : The hand has a dual blood supply , with both the ulnar and radial arteries contributing. This means that if the radial artery becomes occluded, the hand still has a blood supply from the ulnar artery. Before cannulation , the Allen's test can be done to ensure good ulnar artery perfusion . Stable Signal : The radial artery provides a stable and clear pressure waveform , which is essential for accurate monitoring . Low Complication Rate : Complications such as infection , thrombosis, or embolism are relatively lower in the radial artery compared to other sites. Patient Comfort : The wrist's position can be more comfortable for the patient compared to other potential sites for arterial line placement.

Vasoconstrictors like adrenaline reduce the blood flow to the area where the local anesthetic is injected. This decreased blood flow results in reduced absorption of the local anesthetic into the bloodstream , as it limits the rate at which the drug enters the systemic circulation . As a result, the presence of adrenaline in the local anesthetic solution prolongs the duration of action and provides a more profound block , making the anesthesia more effective and longer lasting . This vasoconstrictor action of adrenaline is particularly useful in regional anesthesia techniques like femoral and sciatic blocks , where it helps improve the depth and duration of anesthesia .
