They suppress cytotoxic T-cell function \u2013 Incorrect While IL-10 has immunosuppressive properties and can dampen excessive immune responses, Th2 cells do not directly function to suppress cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells). Instead, regulatory T cells (Tregs) are responsible for suppressing cytotoxic T-cell function by secreting IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2. The primary role of Th2 cells in this scenario is enhancing B cell activity, not suppressing cytotoxic T cells.</li><li>\u2022 D. They primarily secrete IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 \u2013 Incorrect IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 are characteristic cytokines of T-helper 1 (Th1) cells, which are involved in cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens. Th1 cells activate macrophages and cytotoxic T cells to combat viral and bacterial infections, but they are not the dominant players in atopic dermatitis. Since the patient\u2019s immune response is Th2-skewed, with IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 production, this answer is incorrect.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Microscopy does not show yeast or hyphae; instead, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are required for diagnosis. Vaginal pH is usually unchanged or slightly elevated. (D) Trichomoniasis \u2013 Incorrect</li><li>\u2022 Trichomonas vaginalis, a motile protozoan, causes yellow-green, frothy, foul-smelling discharge, not the thick white discharge seen in candidiasis.
