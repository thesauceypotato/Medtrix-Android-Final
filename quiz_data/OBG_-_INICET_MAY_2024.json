This leads to the symptoms of primary amenorrhea, cyclical abdominal pain, urinary retention, and the presence of a suprapubic mass and bluish bulge in the vaginal area due to accumulation. Primary Amenorrhea : The absence of menstruation by age 15 in a girl who has otherwise normal secondary sexual characteristics. Acute Retention of Urine : Can occur due to obstruction of the outflow of menstrual blood. Cyclical Pain Abdomen : Indicative of menstrual blood accumulation. Suprapubic Mass : Likely due to the collection of menstrual blood in the uterus (hematometra) and possibly in the vagina (hematocolpos). Tense Bluish Bulge in the Vagina : Suggests the presence of accumulated menstrual blood behind an obstruction, which is typically seen with an imperforate hymen.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Imperforate hymen : is the urogenital origin.

Diagnosis of ruptured ectopic pregnancy is made based on clinical features: Amenorrhoea for 6-8 weeks followed by bleeding PV Abdominal pain Hemodynamically unstable Urine pregnancy test - positive Surgical treatment of ectopic pregnancy includes salpingectomy or salpingostomy, performed either through laparoscopy or laparotomy. Management of suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy consists of initial resuscitation and stabilization, followed by point-of-care ultrasound (FAST) to identify intraperitoneal free fluid and surgical exploration. For patients wishing to preserve future fertility, if the contralateral fallopian tube is damaged, salpingostomy is preferred.

IV Labetalol : Used to control and lower the blood pressure. Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO4) : Administered to prevent seizures (eclampsia). Expedite Delivery : The definitive treatment for severe preeclampsia is delivery of the baby, as continuing the pregnancy poses significant risks to both the mother and the fetus. Given the severity of the condition and the gestational age of 36 weeks, immediate intervention with IV labetalol, magnesium sulfate, and expedited delivery is warranted to manage the mother's condition and prevent complications In severe pre-eclampsia: If pregnancy < 34 weeks: MgSO4 is given for prophylaxis of eclampsia and pregnancy is terminated . If pregnancy is at 27-34 weeks : expectant management is followed and the baby is delivered at 34weeks, as shown below in the flowchart.</p>\n<p></p>",

But since the quantitative assessment of liquor amnii is impractical. The most commonly used definition is by ultrasound assessment, i.e. when amniotic fluid index (AFI) is > 25 cm or finding of a pocket of fluid measuring 8 cm or more in vertical diameter. Grades of Polyhydramnios- Mild is defined as pockets measuring 8-11 cm in vertical dimension (seen in 80% of cases). Severe is defined as a free-floating fetus found in pockets of fluid of 16 cm or more (seen in 5% of cases). Moderate is defined as a pocket measuring 12-15 cm in vertical dimension (seen in 15% of cases). com COMPLICATIONS OF POLYHYDRAMNIOS: Maternal: During pregnancy \u2014There is an increased incidence of (1) Preeclampsia (2) Malpresentation and persistence of floating head, (3) Premature rupture of the membranes (4) Preterm labo During labor: (1) Early rupture of the membranes (2) Cord prolapse (3) Uterine inertia (4) operative Increased delivery due to malpresentation (5) Retained placenta , postpartum hemorrhage and shock. The postpartum hemorrhage is due to uterine atony. Puerperium : (1) Subinvolution (2) Increased puerperal morbidity due to infection. Fetal: There is increased perinatal mortality.

Precocious Development of the Swallowing Reflex in the Fetus Description: If the swallowing reflex develops too early, the fetus might absorb amniotic fluid more effectively.

Hypoplasia of the Lungs Description: This refers to underdevelopment of the lungs. Mechanism: It is generally associated with oligohydramnios, as less fetal lung development impairs the production of lung fluids that contribute to amniotic fluid.

Maternal Symptoms Maternal symptoms may include increased abdominal size, shortness of breath, and discomfort.
