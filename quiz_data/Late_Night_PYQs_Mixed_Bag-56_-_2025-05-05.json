With this calibration, the Hounsfield units are converted to bone mineral density values. The technique can be used for both peripheral and central BMD measurements, with lumbar spine and hip being preferred locations. DEXA measures the bone mineral density of both the outer (cortical) shell and the inner (trabecular) structure of the bone. QCT, on the other hand, measures only the inner part.

Contracted pelvis: A pelvis that is too small to allow the passage of the fetus. History of Classical Cesarean Section: Classical C-sections involve a vertical incision in the uterus, increasing the risk of uterine rupture. History of 2 or more Lower Segment Cesarean Sections (LSCS): Multiple C-sections also increase the risk of uterine rupture. Malpresentation: Includes breech, transverse, or any non-cephalic presentation of the fetus. Obstructed labor: Labor that does not progress due to physical obstruction. Fetal distress: Signs that the fetus is not well, such as abnormal heart rate patterns. Hypovolemia: Reduced blood volume in the mother, which can complicate the use of oxytocin.</li><li>\u2022 Grand multipara: Women who have given birth five or more times.</li><li>\u2022 Grand multipara:</li><li>\u2022 Contracted pelvis: A pelvis that is too small to allow the passage of the fetus.</li><li>\u2022 Contracted pelvis:</li><li>\u2022 History of Classical Cesarean Section: Classical C-sections involve a vertical incision in the uterus, increasing the risk of uterine rupture.</li><li>\u2022 History of Classical Cesarean Section:</li><li>\u2022 History of 2 or more Lower Segment Cesarean Sections (LSCS): Multiple C-sections also increase the risk of uterine rupture.</li><li>\u2022 History of 2 or more Lower Segment Cesarean Sections (LSCS):</li><li>\u2022 Malpresentation: Includes breech, transverse, or any non-cephalic presentation of the fetus.</li><li>\u2022 Malpresentation:</li><li>\u2022 Obstructed labor: Labor that does not progress due to physical obstruction.</li><li>\u2022 Obstructed labor:</li><li>\u2022 Fetal distress: Signs that the fetus is not well, such as abnormal heart rate patterns.</li><li>\u2022 Fetal distress:</li><li>\u2022 Hypovolemia: Reduced blood volume in the mother, which can complicate the use of oxytocin.</li><li>\u2022 Hypovolemia:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

This scenario highlights the critical balance needed between air delivery to the lungs and blood flow through the pulmonary circulation for effective respiratory gas exchange.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
