The titanium fixture is surgically embedded in the skull bone with an abutment exposed outside the skin. The titanium fixture bonds with the surrounding tissue in a process called osseointegration. The sound processor is attached to the abutment once osseointegration is complete which usually takes 2\u20136 months after implantation.</p>\n<p></p>",
