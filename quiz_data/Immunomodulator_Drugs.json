In low-risk GTN methotrexate is curative as a single drug agent used at 15\u201330 mg/day for 5 days. Methotrexate acts by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFRase), thus blocking the conversion of dihydrofolic acid (DHFA) to tetrahydrofolic acid (THFA). Etoposide & Vincristine are part of the Bagshawe Regimen given in high-risk GTN and cannot be given as single drug therapy. Infliximab is a chimeral monoclonal antibody that inactivates TNF\u03b1. It has proven helpful in refractory rheumatoid arthritis, fistulating Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Etoposide is used to treat different cancers of the blood, lung, and testicles. It is also sometimes used to treat some other kinds of cancer in both men and women. It can be used on its own, or sometimes given together with certain other medicines as part of combination chemotherapy. Option: C. Infliximab is used for the treatment of various inflammatory conditions of the joints (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis), skin (psoriasis), and bowel (ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease). It reduces inflammation in these conditions by blocking TNF alpha. Option: D. Vincristine also known as leurocristine and marketed under the brand name Oncovin among others, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat a number of types of cancer. This includes acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, neuroblastoma, and small-cell lung cancer.</p>\n<p></p>",
