Local anaesthetics may also bind and inhibit calcium, potassium, chloride channels and many other channels. But main action is on Sodium channels. The voltage gated sodium channels exists in 3 states : Resting Activated state and Inactivated state Sodium channels have one larger \u03b1 Subunit and one or two smaller \u03b2 subunits. The LA binds to \u03b1 subunits of sodium channels, thereby preventing their activation and inhibiting influx of sodium.</p>\n<p></p>",

Ethmoidal nerves, which are branches of the nasociliary nerve. Indications Used for anesthesia or analgesia in ophthalmic procedures involving the cornea, iris, and ciliary body . Primarily for nasal surgery, particularly procedures involving the middle or superior nasal turbinates. Procedure By injecting a local anesthetic near the medial canthus of the eye, targeting the nasociliary nerve's path. By injecting a local anesthetic into the nasal mucosa, targeting the ethmoidal nerves as they branch from the nasociliary nerve. Anesthetic Area Provides anesthesia to the upper part of the face, including the forehead, scalp, and upper eyelid. Provides anesthesia to the nasal cavity and adjacent structures. Common Uses Corneal or intraocular procedures. Nasal surgeries and procedures, such as endoscopic sinus surgery.</p>\n<p></p>",
