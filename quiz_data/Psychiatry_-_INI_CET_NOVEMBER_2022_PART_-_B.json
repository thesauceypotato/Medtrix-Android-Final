      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>a, b, c, d Maternal depression and SSRI intake during pregnancy can have various effects on the newborn. The following observations can be made: ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder): Untreated maternal depression is associated with an increased risk of ADHD in newborns. However, it is important to note that the causal relationship between SSRIs and ADHD is inconclusive due to confounding factors. Delayed milestones: Infants exposed to SSRIs during pregnancy may experience temporary delays in reaching developmental milestones. These delays are typically resolved over time. It is worth considering that delayed milestones can also be influenced by the mother's disinterest due to her own depression. Low APGAR score: APGAR scores are a quick assessment of a newborn's overall health immediately after birth. Maternal depression and SSRI intake have been linked to lower APGAR scores in newborns. Persistent pulmonary hypertension: Taking SSRIs during the second half of pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns. This condition affects the blood vessels in the lungs, leading to poor oxygenation and potential complications.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The decision to continue or discontinue SSRI treatment during pregnancy should be made on an individual basis, considering the risks and benefits for both the mother and the unborn child. Close monitoring of the newborn for any potential effects of maternal depression and SSRI exposure is essential for early intervention, if needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>SSRI side effects Non-psychiatric side effects Psychiatric side effects Rare side effects Most common Other \u25cf        Headache \u25cf        Nausea \u25cf        Vomiting \u25cf        Abdominal pain \u25cf        Dry mouth \u25cf        Discontinuation syndrome \u25cf        Sweating \u25cf        Flushing \u25cf        Weight changes \u25cf        Sexual side effects \u25cf        Flu-like symptoms \u25cf        Aches \u25cf        Rash and itchy skin \u25cf        Epistaxis \u25cf        Insomnia \u25cf        Sedation \u25cf        Suicidal ideas and behaviours \u25cf        Hypomania or mania (manic switching \u25cf        Akathisia \u25cf        Agitation \u25cf        Serotonin syndrome \u25cf        Hyponatraemia (probably more of an issue in the elderly) \u25cf        Lowered seizure threshold \u25cf        A motivation syndrome \u25cf        Decreased projected \u25cf        growth \u25cf        Increased anxiety \u25cf        Irritability \u25cf        Hypersensitivity \u25cf        Anger \u25cf        Worsening of depression \u25cf        Tremor \u25cf        Crying</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Generalised anxiety disorder Generalised anxiety disorder produces fear, worry, and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. Generalised anxiety disorder is characterised by persistent, excessive, and unrealistic worry about everyday things. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalised anxiety disorder</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Low serotonin system activity and elevated noradrenergic system activity are responsible for GAD. Therefore Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are the first-line agents for its treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Adjustment disorder : This diagnosis is not appropriate as the woman's symptoms are not specifically related to a stressful event or situation. Option C. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder : While intrusive thoughts are present, the woman's primary symptom is excessive worry rather than the characteristic obsessions and compulsions seen in OCD. Option D. Panic disorder : Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent panic attacks, which are sudden and intense episodes of fear or discomfort. The woman's symptoms do not align with the criteria for panic disorder.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>GAD often coexists with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression or substance use disorders. Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth Edition (DSM-V) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying The anxiety results in significant distress or impairment in social and occupational areas The anxiety is not attributable to any physical cause</p>\n<p></p>",
