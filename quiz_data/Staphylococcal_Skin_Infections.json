This patient has comorbidities such as diabetes, and renal disease making her more prone to such infections.

Option B. CT myelogram, which can diagnose spinal stenosis or other vertebral pathology (including osteomyelitis), is performed by injecting contrast into the lumbar spine before CT imaging. However, it is more invasive than MRI and usually reserved for patients who cannot undergo MRI (eg, those with a pacemaker, or metallic implants). Option C. Lumbar puncture is typically used for diagnosing meningitis and has a low yield for diagnosing vertebral osteomyelitis.

Adults who develop the condition are more likely to have vertebral involvement and frequently have a predisposition to bacteremia due to risk factors such as IV drug abuse or indwelling vascular catheters. The presenting symptoms of hematogenous osteomyelitis are vague, and a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis. Initial symptoms such as malaise and fevers are non-specific. As the infection progresses, infants and younger children may refuse to move the affected extremity. Older children often complain of pain over a long bone.

Streptococcus pneumoniae are lancet-shaped, gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic bacteria with more than 100 known serotypes. Most S. pneumoniae serotypes can cause disease, but only a minority of serotypes produce the majority of pneumococcal infections. Options A, B, and D.

T he target PBP is altered and thereby the drug is unable to bind. This is controlled by the mecA gene. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates are often resistant to other classes of antibiotics (through different mechanisms) making treatment options limited, and this has led to the search for new compounds active against these strains.

Bacteriophage transduction greatly increases the speed and ease of S. aureus studies by allowing the movement of chromosomal markers and plasmids between strains.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B. Transformation - Bacterial transformation is a process of horizontal gene transfer by which some bacteria take up f oreign genetic material (naked DNA) from the environment. It was first reported in Streptococcus pneumoniae by Griffith in 1928. Option C. Bacterial conjugation also referred to as bacterial sex via a pili, is a major horizontal gene transfer mechanism through which DNA is transferred from a donor to a recipient bacterium by direct contact. Option D. Transfection is the process by which foreign DNA is deliberately introduced into a eukaryotic cell through non-viral methods including both chemical and physical methods in the lab.</p>\n<p></p>",
