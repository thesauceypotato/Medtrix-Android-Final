It appears more localized compared to a fusiform aneurysm, which involves the full circumference of the vessel wall. CT Angiogram Findings : On contrast-enhanced CT or CT angiography (CTA) , a saccular aneurysm presents as a well-demarcated, rounded or lobulated outpouching from the aortic wall. The wall of the aneurysm may be thin , and there may be calcifications present in the wall in chronic cases. The presence of an intraluminal thrombus can appear as a non-enhancing area within the aneurysm sac. Image source - Researchgate (A) Preoperative CT scan showing a saccular aneurysm in the distal aortic arch (arrow). (B) Postoperative CT scan performed 5 days after the TEVAR showing that the endograft conformed to the curvature of the thoracic aorta. (C) Six months after the TEVAR. The curvature of the aortic arch had been straightened by the implantation of the endograft (compared). Also, aneurysmal changes were detected at the distal edge of the endograft. Associated Findings : Surrounding compression : The aneurysm may compress adjacent structures, leading to symptoms such as chest pain or hoarseness. For example, compression of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve leads to Ortner\u2019s syndrome , causing hoarseness. Signs of potential rupture : A large aneurysm or one with irregular walls is at risk for rupture, and on imaging, extravasation of contrast or areas of low attenuation surrounding the aneurysm may suggest leakage or impending rupture. Differential Diagnosis : The differential for saccular aneurysms includes pseudoaneurysms (which result from trauma), which have similar appearances but different etiologies.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Double ring sign Radiograph shows a circular object (probably button battery) lodged in the esophagus . A button battery shows two concentric rings or radiopaque circles on X-ray, differentiating it from a simple coin. Importance: Immediate identification is crucial as button batteries can cause tissue damage due to electrical discharge and chemical injury.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Common Types of Foreign Bodies : Coins : The most common foreign body ingested by children, appearing as a radiopaque circular object on radiographs. They are typically seen in the coronal plane when located in the esophagus. Button batteries : These can be mistaken for coins but are distinguished by the double ring sign on X-ray. This is critical to differentiate as batteries can cause severe injury to the esophagus. Sharp objects (e.g., bones, needles): These are highly dangerous due to the risk of perforation. They appear as linear radiopaque objects on imaging. Radiographic Appearance : X-rays (Plain Radiographs) are the first-line imaging modality used to identify foreign bodies in the esophagus. They can provide details about the size, shape, and location of the foreign object. For coins , anteroposterior (AP) radiographs will show the flat surface of the coin if it is lodged in the esophagus, with the round radiopaque shape oriented towards the coronal plane. In the trachea, the coin typically appears in the sagittal plane. Button batteries appear as a circular radiopaque object, but the distinguishing feature is the double ring or halo sign (due to the battery casing), seen in the AP view. Sharp objects will appear linear and can sometimes be partially embedded into the esophageal wall, which may complicate retrieval. Complications Esophageal perforation : If the foreign body has been lodged for an extended period, there might be signs of perforation, such as air in the mediastinum (pneumomediastinum) or in severe cases, pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema. Battery ingestion : Rapid tissue necrosis can occur within 2-4 hours, and imaging may show signs of esophageal erosion or ulceration around the foreign body. Air-fluid levels or dilation : Prolonged retention of a foreign body can cause esophageal distension or secondary infection, resulting in air-fluid levels visible on a chest X-ray. A round metallic foreign body lies in the midline just above the aortic knob, suggestive of a coin within the esophagus, the coin exceeds the diameter of the trachea, also on the lateral view, the trachea appears anterior to the coin, so that it can not lie within it.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

The patient presents with fatigue, facial congestion, dilated neck veins, and breathlessness , indicative of superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction caused by a mediastinal mass. Thymomas typically occur in the anterior mediastinum , where they can compress surrounding structures, including the SVC.

Location : Anterior mediastinum is the most common site for thymomas, and they are often seen adjacent to the heart and great vessels, such as the superior vena cava (SVC) . Their location predisposes them to cause SVC obstruction or compress nearby structures, resulting in symptoms like facial swelling , dilated neck veins , and dyspnea , as in the case of this patient. CT Imaging Features : Non-contrast CT (NCCT) : Thymomas appear as well-defined masses in the anterior mediastinum. They are often homogeneous but may contain calcifications or cystic areas if they are larger or more advanced. Contrast-enhanced CT : On contrast-enhanced CT , thymomas generally enhance homogeneously but may have areas of necrosis or hemorrhage in advanced cases. These tumors may also invade adjacent structures, such as the pleura or pericardium . CT is critical for assessing the degree of invasion. Thymomas can have smooth or lobulated contours , and large tumors may demonstrate irregular borders due to local invasion . MRI Features : T1-weighted images : Thymomas are typically iso- to hypointense compared to muscle. T2-weighted images : Thymomas tend to be hyperintense due to their soft tissue composition and potential cystic changes. MRI is particularly useful in assessing the extent of invasion into adjacent structures, such as the great vessels (e.g., SVC), pericardium, or lungs.

May visualize dilated common bile duct or cystic dilatations depending on the type. Doppler can help rule out vascular origin of the cystic structure.

Clearly delineates the type and extent of the cystic dilatation. Can assess for associated complications like strictures, stones, or pancreatitis.
