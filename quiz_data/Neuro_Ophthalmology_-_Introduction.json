Complete homonymous hemianopia involves the complete visual hemifields of both eyes and can occur with any large enough lesion posterior to the optic chiasma. Visual field examination alone cannot further localize the lesion in such cases. Incomplete homonymous hemianopia is due to smaller lesions in the visual pathway posterior to the optic chiasm. They are further divided into congruous and incongruous depending on the extent to which the defects in the two half fields match each other exactly. Because of a relative disorder among axon bundles in the immediate post-chiasmal region, diseases in this location produce rather incongruent lesions. Options: A and B .More posteriorly, the axon bundles of the corresponding areas of the two hemifields are more closely aligned and hence, lesions of the occipital cortex produce congruous homonymous hemianopia while incongruous homonymous hemianopia is more likely seen with optic tract lesions.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Connection of Visual Cortex Primary visual cortex (V1)-Input from LGN and output to all other levels.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>45-50mm The optic nerve is about 47-50 in length , and can be divided into 4 parts : intraocular (1 mm), intraorbital (30 mm), intracanalicular mm) and intracranial (10 mm) . The intraocular part starts from the optic disc and pierces the choroid and sclera (converting into a sieve-like structure the lamina cribrosa) the back of the eyeball it becomes continuous with the intraorbital part. The intraorbital part extends from the back of the eye to the optic foramina. This part is slightly sinuous given the play for the eye movements. Posteriorly, near the optic foramina, it is closely surrounded by the Annu of Zinn and the origin of the four rectus muscles Some fibres of the superior rectus muscle adhere to its sheath here, and account for the painful ocular movements seen in retrobulbar neuritis. Anteriorly the nerve is separated from the ocular muscles by the orbital fat. The intracanalicular part is closely related to the ophthalmic artery which lies inferolateral and crosses obliquely over it, as it enters the orbit, to lie on its medial side. Sphenoid and posterior ethmoidal sinuses lie medial to them and are separated by a thin bony lamina. This relation accounts for retrobulbar neuritis following infection of the sinuses. The intracranial part of the optic nerve lies above the cavernous sinus and converges with its fellow (over the diaphragm sellae) to form the optic chiasma.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Optic Nerve Disorders : Glaucoma- Is a group of diseases that are the leading cause of blindness.
