      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Pelvic assessment Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) is the disparity in the relation between the head of the fetus and the pelvis. Both the fetus and pelvis are normal, but disproportionate. The best predictor of CPD is the trial of labour . A trial of labour is done only for mild CPD at the level of the pelvic inlet . If CPD is expected at the level of cavity or outlet \u2013 a trial of labour is not attempted. Clinically: By per abdomen examination/bimanual examination (Muller- munrokerr method). The bimanual method is superior to the abdominal method as pelvic assessment can be done simultaneously. Other options are also used to assess but pelvic assessment is the best method.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Limitations of clinical assessment: It can assess the disproportion of the brim and not of the mid pelvis or outlet. The fetal head can be used as a pelvimeter to elicit only the contraction in the anteroposterior plane of the inlet. (If contraction affects the transverse diameter of the inlet, it is of less use).</p>\n<p></p>",

Apart from pelvic capacity, there are several other factors involved in successful vaginal delivery. These are the fetal size, presentation, position and force of uterine contractions. X-ray pelvimetry cannot assess the other factors. It cannot reliably predict the likelihood of vaginal delivery neither in breech presentation nor in cases with previous cesarean section. X-ray pelvimetry is useful in cases with a fractured pelvis and for the important diameters which are inaccessible to clinical examination.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Hazards of X-ray pelvimetry include radiation exposure to the mother and the fetus. With conventional X-ray pelvimetry radiation exposure to the gonads is about 885 millirad . So it is restricted to selected cases only.</p>\n<p></p>",
