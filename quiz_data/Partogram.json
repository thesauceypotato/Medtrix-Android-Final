For the progress of labour and salient conditions of the mother and fetus. It was developed and extensively tested by the world health organisation. Objectives: Early detection of abnormal progress of labour. Prevention of prolonged labour. Recognise cephalopelvic disproportion long before obstructed labour. Assist in early decisions on transfer, augmentation, or termination of labour. Increase the quality and regularity of all observations of the mother and fetus. Early recognition of maternal or fetal problems. The partograph can be highly effective in reducing complications from prolonged labour for the mother (postpartum haemorrhage, sepsis, uterine rupture and its sequelae) and for the newborn (death, anoxia).</p>\n<p></p>",

The fetal heart rate is dropping and not reassuring as it is below the normal cut-off - around 90 bpm. Option: B . As it is a case of second-phase arrest, hence the cervix dilatation is not adequate and has crossed the action lin e, so prompt intervention is required. Option: D .
