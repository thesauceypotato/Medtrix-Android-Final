Amiloride does not affect TGF. Option C: Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic that inhibits NKCC and interferes with Na+, K+, and Cl- reabsorption in the TAL. The macula densa is located at the junction between the TAL and the distal tubule, so furosemide treatment inevitably exposes the macula densa to an increased NaCl load . One might thus expect the AA to constrict via TGF, but TGF relies on a functional NKCC. With NKCC blocked by furosemide, macula densa cells can no longer sense tubule NaCl levels and TGF is interrupted.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Vasovagal syncope An interesting vasodilatory reaction occurs in people who experience intense emotional disturbances that cause fainting. In this case, the muscle vasodilator system becomes activated and, at the same time, the vagal cardioinhibitory center transmits strong signals to the heart to slow the heart rate markedly. The arterial pressure falls rapidly, which reduces blood flow to the brain and causes the person to lose consciousness. This overall effect is called vasovagal syncope.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Vasovagal syncope occurs when a vagus nerve to the heart overreacts to certain situations like extreme heat, anxiety, hunger, pain, or Blood pressure drops very quickly (orthostatic hypotension), making you feel dizzy or faint. Vasovagal syncope is triggered by an exaggerated sympathetic response to a situation; in other words, sympathoexcitation precedes the onset. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex plays an important role in the onset of this type of syncope.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. The fight or flight response is an automatic physiological reaction to an event that is perceived as stressful or frightening. Option C. Normally during exercise, blood pressure increases to push the flow of oxygen-rich blood throughout the body. Option D. The diving response demonstrates a cessation of breathing, decreased heart rate, and an increase in peripheral vascular resistance leading to a redistribution of blood flow to adequately perfuse the brain and heart.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Activation of chemosensitive vagal C fibers in the cardiopulmonary region (e.g., juxta capillary region of alveoli, ventricles, atria, great veins, and pulmonary artery) causes profound bradycardia, hypotension, and a brief period of apnoea followed by rapid shallow breathing. This response pattern is called the Bezold\u2013Jarisch reflex and can be elicited by a variety of substances including capsaicin, serotonin, phenyl biguanide, and veratridine. The Bezold\u2013 Jarisch reflex is activated during certain pathophysiologic conditions. For example, this reflex may be activated during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion as a result of increased production of oxygen radicals and by agents used as radiocontrast for coronary angiography. This can contribute to hypotension which is frequently a stubborn complication of heart disease. Activation of cardiopulmonary chemo-sensitive receptors may also be part of a defense mechanism protecting individuals from toxic chemical hazards. Activation of cardiopulmonary reflexes may help reduce the amount of inspired pollutants that get absorbed into the blood, protecting vital organs from the potential toxicity of these pollutants, and facilitating their elimination. Finally, the syndrome of cardiac slowing with hypotension (vasovagal syncope) has also been attributed to the activation of the Bezold\u2013Jarisch reflex. Vasovagal syncope can occur after prolonged upright posture that results in the pooling of blood in the lower extremities and diminished intracardiac blood volume (also called postural syncope). This phenomenon is exaggerated if combined with dehydration. The resultant arterial hypotension is sensed in the carotid sinus baroreceptors, and afferent fibers from these receptors trigger autonomic signals that increase the cardiac rate and contractility.</p>\n<p></p>",

Ventricular muscle initially shortens relatively little, but intraventricular pressure rises sharply as the myocardium presses on the blood in the ventricle. This period of isovolumetric (isovolumic, isometric) ventricular contraction lasts about 0.05 s until dying pressures in the left and right ventricles exceed the pressures in the aorta (80 mm Hg) and pulmonary artery (10 mm Hg) and the aortic and pulmonary valves open. During isovolumetric contraction, the AV valves bulge into the atria, causing a small but sharp rise in atrial pressure. When the aortic and pulmonary valves open, the phase of ventricular ejection begins. Ejection is rapid at first, slowing down as systole progresses. The intraventricular pressure rises to a maximum and then declines somewhat before the ventricular systole ends. Peak pressures in the left and right ventricles are about 120 and 25 mm Hg, respectively.

(skeletal action potential = 5-10 msec. cardiac action potential = 250 msec) Since the ARP lasts nearly as long as the muscle contraction itself, the membrane is capable of being stimulated again only after the twitch force has fallen nearly completely.

This hormone has two major effects on the heart. First, it decreases the rate of the rhythm of the sinus node, and second, it decreases the excitability of the A-V junctional fibers between the atrial musculature and the A-V node, thereby slowing the transmission of the cardiac impulse into the ventricles. Also, remember Strong stimulation of the vagi can stop the rhythmical excitation by the sinus node. The ventricles may stop beating for 5 to 20 seconds, but then some small area in the Purkinje fibers, usually in the ventricular septal portion of the A-V bundle, develops a rhythm of its own and causes ventricular contraction at a rate of 15 to 40 beats per minute. This phenomenon is called a ventricular escape. Sympathetic Stimulation Increases the Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction. First, it increases the rate of sinus nodal discharge. Second, it increases the rate of conduction, as well as the level of excitability in all portions of the heart. Third, it greatly increases the force of contraction of all the cardiac musculature.

Sometimes the electrical activity of the ventricular papillary muscle is out of phase with the rest of the ventricles and will record as a \u201cU\u201d wave that shows after the T wave.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Conduct impulses more slowly than either atrial or ventricular cells The atrial conduction system is organized so that the cardiac impulse does not travel from the atria into the ventricles too rapidly; this delay allows time for the atria to empty their blood into the ventricles before a ventricular contraction begins. It is primarily the A-V node and its adjacent conductive fibers that delay this transmission into the ventricles.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>CAUSE OF THE DELAY FROM ATRIA TO THE VENTRICLES The impulse, after traveling through the inter-nodal pathways, reaches the A-V node about 0.03 seconds after its origin in the sinus node. Then there is a delay of another 0.09 seconds in the A-V node itself before the impulse enters the penetrating portion of the A-V bundle, where it passes into the ventricles. A final delay of another 0.04 seconds occurs mainly in this penetrating A-V bundle. Thus, the total delay in the A-V nodal and A-V bundle system is about 0.13 seconds. This delay, in addition to the initial conduction delay of 0.03 seconds from the sinus node to the A-V node, makes a total delay of 0.16 seconds before the excitatory signal finally reaches the contracting muscle of the ventricles.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Conduction speed in Cardiac tissues Tissue Conduction Rate (m/s) SA node 0.05 Atrial pathways 1 AV node 0.05 Bundle of His 1 Purkinje system 4 Ventricular muscle 1</p>\n<p></p>",

Thus, this prepotential in pacemaker potential triggers the next impulse. At the peak of each impulse, I K begins and brings about repolarization. I K then declines, and a channel that can pass both Na + and K + is activated. Because this channel is activated following hyperpolarization, it is referred to as an \u201ch\u201d channel; however, because of its unusual (funny) activation, this has also been dubbed an \u201cf\u201d channel. As I h increases, the membrane begins to depolarize, forming the first part of the prepotential. Ca 2+ channels then open.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The tendency for the action potential of cardiac cell membranes to drift towards the threshold following repolarization.
