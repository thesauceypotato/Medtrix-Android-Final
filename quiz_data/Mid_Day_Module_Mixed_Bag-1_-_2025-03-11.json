However, within a week of discontinuing the treatment, the itching returned and the rash spread. She denies any new products or environmental exposures. Physical examination reveals poorly demarcated, erythematous plaques with slight scaling scattered over her face, as shown in the image below.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. C) Tinea incognito</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Tinea incognito is a fungal infection that has been altered by the inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids. This condition often presents with atypical features compared to a classic dermatophyte infection. The history of initial improvement with a topical ointment (likely a corticosteroid) followed by a return and worsening of symptoms after discontinuation is characteristic of tinea incognito. The poorly demarcated erythematous plaques with slight scaling observed on physical examination support this diagnosis. The use of corticosteroids suppresses the inflammation and itching temporarily but allows the fungal infection to proliferate more aggressively once the treatment is stopped.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Tinea corporis : This typically presents with well-demarcated, annular, scaly plaques with central clearing and an active border, which is not the case here.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Tinea corporis</li><li>\u2022 Option B.

Tinea cruris</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Tinea capitis : This affects the scalp and hair, presenting with scaly patches, hair loss, and sometimes black dots. The facial distribution and presentation described do not match tinea capitis.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
