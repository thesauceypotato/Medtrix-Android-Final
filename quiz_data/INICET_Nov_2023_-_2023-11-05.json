This is because they have a distinctive two-layer structure which shows up clearly on radiographs. The appearance in the X-ray  is characteristic of a button battery, with a clearly visible double rim.

Here, the patient scores at least 3 points (confusion, tachypnea, age \u2265 65), indicating a need for hospital admission and potentially ICU care.</li><li>\u2022 In managing CAP with a high CURB-65 score, empirical antibiotic therapy typically includes a combination of a beta-lactam (like ceftriaxone) and a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (like levofloxacin).

Admit and give IV levofloxacin:</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Treat at home with oral Amox-clav: Given the patient's high CURB-65 score, home treatment is inappropriate.

The elevated pCO2 of 60 mmHg (normal: 35-45 mmHg) points to a respiratory cause of the acidosis, specifically respiratory acidosis. In COPD patients, chronic CO2 retention is common, leading to increased bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels as a compensatory mechanism. However, in acute respiratory acidosis, the metabolic compensation is typically inadequate, as seen by the HCO3- level of 28 mEq/L (normal: 22-28 mEq/L).

Each has its strengths and particular clinical situations where it might be the preferred choice.</li><li>\u2022 Tc Sestamibi SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography technique also utilizes Technetium-99m sestamibi but combines it with CT imaging to provide three-dimensional imaging. This makes SPECT more sensitive than a plain sestamibi scan for locating parathyroid tumors, especially when they are ectopic or embedded deep within the neck or chest.</li><li>\u2022 Tc Sestamibi SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Tc Sestamibi Scan : This is a nuclear medicine scan that uses a small amount of a radioactive compound , typically Technetium-99m sestamibi, which is absorbed by active parathyroid tissue more than normal tissue. While sensitive, it provides a two-dimensional view which can sometimes make precise localization of smaller or deeper tumors challenging.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Tc Sestamibi Scan</li><li>\u2022 Option C. USG (Ultrasound): Ultrasound is useful for imaging the parathyroid glands due to its non-invasive nature and ability to detect lesions in real-time. It is particularly effective for glands located in typical positions near the thyroid. However, its effectiveness diminishes for ectopic glands or in obese patients where acoustic windows may be poor.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. USG (Ultrasound):</li><li>\u2022 Option D. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging): MRI can provide detailed images and is useful in complex cases, such as when other imaging modalities fail or in surgical planning. However, its sensitivity is generally lower than Sestamibi SPECT for detecting parathyroid adenomas, and it is less commonly used primarily due to higher costs and limited availability.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

Its primary function is to regulate calcium homeostasis in the body, ensuring that blood calcium levels remain within a narrow and critical range. Increase in Blood Calcium: PTH increases blood calcium levels by stimulating various physiological processes: Stimulation of Osteoclasts: PTH activates osteoclasts, specialized bone cells responsible for breaking down bone tissue. This results in the release of calcium from the bones into the bloodstream. Enhanced Calcium Reabsorption: PTH enhances the reabsorption of calcium by the kidneys. This means that less calcium is excreted in urine, conserving it for use in the body. Activation of Vitamin D: PTH indirectly stimulates the production of active vitamin D (calcitriol) in the kidneys. Calcitriol helps increase calcium absorption from the digestive tract, further contributing to higher blood calcium levels. Negative Feedback Loop: The regulation of PTH secretion is tightly controlled by a negative feedback loop. When blood calcium levels drop below the normal range, the parathyroid glands release PTH, which acts to raise calcium levels.

TSH is the most sensitive indicator of thyroid function because even minor changes in thyroid hormone levels cause significant changes in TSH levels due to the feedback mechanism between the thyroid gland and the pituitary gland. Elevated or suppressed TSH levels provide clear insight into whether the thyroid gland is underactive (hypothyroidism) or overactive (hyperthyroidism). Given the patient's symptoms of weight loss, anxiety, tachycardia, and restlessness, hyperthyroidism is suspected, making TSH the appropriate initial test.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. B. CO2 embolism</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 In the scenario described, a sudden decrease in end-tidal CO2 (etCO2) to 8 mm Hg, along with a drop in blood pressure (BP) to 80/50 mm Hg and oxygen saturation (SpO2) to 90%, but with normal peak airway pressure (18 mm Hg), strongly suggests a CO2 embolism. During laparoscopic procedures, CO2 is used for insufflation to create a pneumoperitoneum, which can occasionally enter a blood vessel and cause a CO2 embolism. This event leads to a rapid decrease in etCO2 due to reduced return of CO2 to the lungs, hypoxemia, and cardiovascular collapse. The normal peak airway pressures help differentiate it from other causes of acute respiratory distress.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Pneumothorax : A pneumothorax, or collapsed lung, could occur due to barotrauma from mechanical ventilation or surgical complications. However, it typically causes an increase in peak airway pressures due to increased resistance to ventilation. The absence of increased peak airway pressures makes pneumothorax less likely in this case.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Pneumothorax</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Endobronchial Intubation : Endobronchial intubation occurs when the endotracheal tube is inserted too far and intubates one of the main bronchi, typically the right main bronchus. This can lead to hypoventilation of one lung, causing a decrease in etCO2 and SpO2. However, peak airway pressures might be higher due to one-lung ventilation, which was not observed here.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Endobronchial Intubation</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Bronchospasm : Bronchospasm involves the constriction of the muscles in the walls of the bronchioles, leading to narrowed airways. This would usually present with an increase in peak airway pressures due to the narrowed airways, which is not consistent with the normal peak airway pressures reported in this scenario.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
