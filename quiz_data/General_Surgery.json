Mandibular resection: Decisions regarding management of the mandible when tumour lies close to, abuts or invades the bone are critical. If there is evidence of infiltrative bone invasion, either segmental or rim resection of the involved mandible is required. Management of the neck: In patients with clinical and/or radiographic evidence of cervical metastases, treatment of the neck in the form of a therapeutic neck dissection is indicated (primary radiotherapy is less common). In patients with early-stage disease and in whom there is no clinical or radiographic evidence for cervical metastases, there is now strong evidence showing that patients who have an up-front or elective neck dissection have better overall and disease-specific survival relative to patients who have a \u2018watch-and-wait\u2019 policy and a therapeutic neck dissection only when a metastasis becomes apparent. SLNB can be utilised as a staging investigation to better guide the indications for a neck dissection in the setting of a small tumour where occult metastases may still be present Chemoradiation: Adjuvant therapy is given based on pathological features of the tumour. Radiotherapy is administered typically via external beam radiotherapy. In high-risk cases, chemotherapy (usually cisplatin-based) is included as a radiosensitiser within the adjuvant regime for suitably fit patients. High risk tumors (warranting adjuvant CRT): Lympho-vascular invasion, Extra-nodal extension (ENE), peri-neural invasion.

The commonest cause for this is in patients with short bowel syndrome related to massive intestinal resection or a significant reduction in functional small bowel, often related to intestinal fistulation. Commonly provided by the hospital pharmacy in the form of a 3-litre bag containing a lipid emulsion with a mixture of essential and non-essential amino acids, glucose, electrolytes, trace elements and vitamins. Usually administered directly into the central venous system (the superior vena cava [SVC] or the right atrium) to minimise the risk of venous thrombophlebitis, through either a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) or central venous catheter. Femoral lines should be avoided for parenteral nutrition because of the high risk of infection. In patients who are likely to require long-term parenteral nutrition, an implantable port or a Hickman line may be more appropriate. These are implanted via fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance with a subcutaneous port or cuff and a catheter attachment sitting within the SVC. Line misplacement can also occur and is diagnosed on chest radiograph, which is mandatory following central line insertion.

The PSN is usually sensory in the early phase \u2013 classically in a stocking distribution and renders the patients at high risk of soft-tissue injury and its subsequent neglect. The PSN may extend to the joints of the foot and ankle, resulting in loss of nociceptive and proprioceptive protective reflexes and a repeated cycle of joint injury and bony destruction. Motor involvement causes an imbalance between flexors and extensor muscle groups of the foot, promoting altered foot biomechanics and abnormal pressure loading, which result in thick callosities developing on the sole of the foot.

Indications are - Prostatectomy, cardiac valve repair, gynecological operations The current era of surgical robots is dominated by the da Vinci\u00ae surgical system, which was first approved for clinical use in 2000. The system offers a number of advantages, including 3D surgical vision, EndoWrist\u00ae precision instruments, tremor reduction, and motion scaling and improved ergonomics. Improved maneuvering as a result of the \u2018robotic wrist\u2019 in some systems allows for up to seven degrees of freedom, thus improving dexterity for the surgeon The enclosed console system of many robotic systems also provides the advantage of surgical isolation from external distractions that may impact on the operator\u2019s concentration.

To complete the cycle, the current then passes through the tissues and returns via a very large surface plate (the indifferent electrode or dispersive cable) back to the earth pole of the generator. The passage of current through the body tissues can interfere with cardiac pacemaker. In bipolar diathermy, the two active electrodes are usually represented by the limbs of a pair of diathermy forceps, blades of scissors or graspers. Both forceps ends are therefore active and current flows between them and only the tissue held between the limbs of the forceps heats up. This form of diathermy is used when working in sensitive areas (e.g. near the recurrent laryngeal nerve in thyroid surgery) or in patients with implantable electrical devices, as current can interfere with these devices. A separate return electrode (the indifferent electrode) to return current is not needed. Burns are the most common type of diathermy accidents and occur when the current flows in some way other than that which the surgeon intended; they are far more common in monopolar than bipolar.</li><li>\u27a4 In monopolar surgery , the electrical current created in the Electro-Surgical Unit (ESU) passes through a single electrode (diathermy pencil) to the tissue, causing the desired tissue effect (cut or coagulation).

The feedback-sensing technology incorporated in the instrument is designed to manage the energy delivery in a precise manner and results in automatic discontinuation of energy once the seal is complete. Ultra-sonic: The harmonic scalpel is an instrument that uses ultrasound technology to cut tissues while simultaneously sealing them. It utilizes a hand-held ultrasound transducer and scalpel that is controlled by a hand switch or foot pedal. During use, the scalpel vibrates in the 20 000\u201350 000-Hz range and cuts through tissues, effecting haemostasis by sealing vessels and tissues by means of protein denaturation caused by vibration rather than heat (in a similar manner to whisking an egg white).

About 80% of salivary stones form in the submandibular gland. They are usually formed of calcium or magnesium phosphate. Most salivary gland stones (about 80%) are radiopaque and visible on radiographs or CT scans. A stone in the submandibular gland presents intermittent pain and swelling of the submandibular region during meals. The impacted stone may irritate the lingual nerve leading to referred pain in the tongue . Sialography is the gold standard for diagnosis and involves injecting a dye into the duct of the salivary gland. It not only helps in diagnosis of sialolithiasis but also identifies any pathology in the duct. Smaller (5 mm) distal stones can be removed with endoscopy while the larger (>5 mm) distal stones may require duct slitting. For an impacted stone, the transoral route is used . Intraparenchymal stones between 5 and 7 mm can be extracted endoscopically while larger stones require transoral slitting. Stones that are not palpable and not visualised endoscopically can be removed using external shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL).

Surgical excision is the definitive treatment, tailored according to the tumor\u2019s classification and involvement with carotid vessels.</li><li>\u27a4 management of a Carotid body tumor</li><li>\u27a4 imaging studies such as USG and CT angiogram</li><li>\u27a4 lesion and plan treatment</li><li>\u27a4 This is a rare tumour that has a higher incidence in areas where people live at high altitudes because of chronic hypoxia leading to carotid body hyperplasia . The tumours most commonly present in the fifth decade. There is an association with phaeochromocytoma in familial cases. The tumours arise from the chemoreceptor cells on the medial side of the carotid bulb and, at this point, the tumour is adherent to the carotid wall. There is often a long history of a slowly enlarging, painless lump at the carotid bifurcation . About one-third of patients present with a pharyngeal mass that pushes the tonsil medially and anteriorly. The mass is firm, rubbery, pulsatile, mobile from side to side but not up and down and can sometimes be emptied by firm pressure, after which it slowly refills in a pulsatile manner. A bruit may also be present. A carotid angiogram can be carried out to demonstrate the carotid bifurcation, which is usually splayed (Lyre sign) and a blush, which outlines the tumour vessels. MRI scanning also provides excellent detail in most cases. This tumour must not be biopsied and fine-needle aspiration is also contraindicated, The Shamblin classification is used to determine the surgical resectability of these tumours. Type I tumours are localised and do not involve more than 180\u00b0 of the carotid vessels; type II tumours surround the vessel by over 180\u00b0; and type III tumours completely encase the vessels and are more challenging to resect with higher complications and a possible need for vessel reconstruction. In some cases, it may be possible to dissect the tumour away from the carotid bifurcation but, at times, when the tumour is large, it may not be separable from the vessels and resection will be necessary, such that all appropriate facilities should be available to establish a bypass while a vein autograft is inserted to restore arterial continuity in the carotid system.</li><li>\u27a4 This is a rare tumour that has a higher incidence in areas where people live at high altitudes because of chronic hypoxia leading to carotid body hyperplasia .
