The quality improvement in labour room & maternity OT is assessed through NQAS (National Quality Assurance standards). Laqshya program: Laqshya programme of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare aims at improving quality of care in labour room and maternity OT. Reduce preventable maternal and newborn mortality, morbidity and stillbirths associated with the care around delivery in labour room and maternity OT and ensure respectful maternity care.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B. It will cover over 10 crore poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries) providing coverage upto 5 lakh rupees per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization. Ayushman Bharat - National Health Protection Mission will subsume the on-going centrally sponsored schemes - Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) and the Senior Citizen Health Insurance Scheme (SCHIS). Option C. Essential care is provided to the mother and her neonate within 48 hours. This postnatal period is critical for identification and management of complication of post-delivery. In case of institutional delivery. accessing availing this care is a little easier. Reasons like high out of pocket expenditure ondiagnostics/investigations, blood, drugs, food and user charges institutional delivery JSSK was launched in June 2011 to eliminate out-of-pocket expenses for institutional delivery of pregnant women and treatment of sick infants. Option D. The Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan has been launched by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India. The program aims to provide assured, comprehensive and quality antenatal care, free of cost, universally to all pregnant women on the 9th of every month. Under the campaign, a minimum package of antenatal care services is to be provided to the beneficiaries on the 9th day of every month at the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Clinics to ensure that every pregnant woman receives at least one checkup in the 2nd/ 3rd trimester of pregnancy. If the 9th day of the month is a Sunday / a holiday, then the Clinic should be organized on the next working day.</p>\n<p></p>",
