It is a serpiginous skin eruption caused by burrowing larvae of animal hookworms (usually the cat and the cat hookworm). The larvae hatch from eggs passed in dog and cat feces and mature in the soil. Humans become infected after skin contact with contaminated soil. After larvae penetrate the skin, erythematous lesions form along the tortuous tracks of their migration. It is also known as a creeping eruption.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Cutaneous larva migrans (creeping eruption), common causes are: Ancylostoma brasiliense (most common) A. caninum Uncinaria stenocephala Gnathostoma spinigerum Bunostomum phlebotomum Visceral larva migrans , common causes are: Toxocara canis (most common) T. cati Angiostrongylus cantonensis Angiostrongylus costaricensis Anisakis spp.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Lactobacillus Lactobacillus is a genus of gram-positive, facultative anaerobic or microaerophilic, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacteria. They are a major part of the lactic acid bacteria group (i.e.  they convert sugars to lactic acid). They are normally a major part of the vaginal microbiota. Acidophiles: Organisms that grow best at low pH are called Acidophiles. The cytoplasm of these organisms is acidic in nature. Some Acidophiles are also thermophiles in nature. Many fungi grow optimum pH 5 or below and few grow well at pH values as level as 2. However, a few bacteria prefer to grow at more extreme pH values, e.g. thiobacillus, thiooxidans has an optimum pH of 2-3.5. Neutrophils: Most microorganisms whose optimum pH for growth is between pH 6 and 8 are referred to as neutrophils. Most bacteria grow best at the neutral pH 7 with a normal range between 6 and 8, e.g. E. coli, Klebsiella, Salmonella, etc. Alkaliphile: Some organisms which have very optimum PH for growth. Sometimes as high as PH 10\u201312 are called alkaliphile. Alkaliphilic microorganisms are usually found in highly basic habitats such as soda lakes and high carbonate soil. Some alkaliphile have been found to be of industrial importance because they produce hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases and lipases which function well at alkaline and are used as supplements for household detergents, e.g. bacillus alkaliphile, vibrio.</p>\n<p></p>",

AHC is a highly contagious ocular infection which can cause large-scale epidemics. Transmission is facilitated by overcrowding and unsanitary conditions. The infection is transmitted directly from finger or fomite to eye. The condition is most prevalent in adults between 20 and 50 years. Enterovirus 70 It is a member of the genus of viruses called Enterovirus and family of the viruses Picornaviridae.  Usually very small (about 30 nm in diameter), it is non-enveloped (meaning it only has a nucleic acid core and protein capsid) and has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome; the protein capsid the virus itself     is surrounded by icosahedral. It is known as one of the more    new enteroviruses within this category. It spreads easily from one person\u2019s eyes to another\u2019s through contact with infected objects like fingers, or through the eye secretion itself. It infrequently causes polio-like permanent paralysis. Coxsackievirus A24 variant It is another member of the genus of viruses called Enterovirus and family of the viruses Picornaviridae. Its isolation host is human. It is an antigenic variant of the Coxsackievirus A24.  It was studied independently for the first time in Singapore in 1970. Adenovirus 11 They are medium-sized variant that are nonenveloped like Enterovirus 70. They have a double-stranded linear DNA genome. There are 57 variants of this virus that each cause 5\u201310% of upper respiratory infections in humans. These viruses are some of the largest nonenveloped viruses in existence, and because of this they can pass through the endosome without any necessary envelope fusion.</p>\n<p></p>",

Along with ciguatera, it is listed as a common type of seafood poisoning. The toxin believed to be responsible is histamine formed as the flesh of the fish begins to decay. As histamine is also the natural agent involved in allergic reactions, scombroid food poisoning often gets misidentified as a food allergy. Histidine is an amino acid that exists naturally in many types of food (including fish) and at temperatures above 16\u00b0C/60\u00b0F it is converted to the biogenic amine histamine via the enzyme histidine decarboxylase produced by symbiotic bacteria such as Morganella morganii (this is one reason why fish should be stored in the freezer). Scombroid poisoning occurs after the ingestion of fresh, canned or smoked fish with high histamine levels due to improper processing or storage. The decarboxylation process is induced by enzymes produced by primarily enteric Gram- negative bacteria (e.g. Morganella morganii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) found in the fish\u2019s cutis and intestines.</p>\n<p></p>",
