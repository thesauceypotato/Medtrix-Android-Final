      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Tympanosclerosis The given clinical scenario is suggestive of tympanosclerosis. It is a sequela of long-standing middle ear disease where there are hyaline deposits within the middle ear , which calcify leading to impaired mobility of ossicles.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A- Otosclerosis, more aptly called otospongiosis , is a primary disease of the bony labyrinth. In this, one or more foci of irregularly laid spongy bone replace part of the normally dense enchondral layer of the bony otic capsule. Option C- When hyalinization and calcification involve only the tympanic membrane, it is known as myringosclerosis. Option D- In Candidal infection of the middle ear there is a thick and creamish-white discharge.</p>\n<p></p>",
