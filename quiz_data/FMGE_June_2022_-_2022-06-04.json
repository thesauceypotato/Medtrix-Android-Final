In this phase, the endometrial glands increase in size, become tortuous and corkscrew-shaped, and exhibit subnuclear vacuolation in the columnar epithelial cells. There is marked spiraling of blood vessels, and stromal cells become swollen and polyhedral. The endometrial thickness reaches 6-8 mm due to the changes brought about by progesterone.</li><li>\u2022 Secretory phase: Subnuclear vacuolation is a histological feature of the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle.

Indications for Le Fort's repair include: Patients who do not wish to retain sexual function. Very elderly menopausal patients with advanced prolapse. Patients medically unfit for major surgeries. This procedure can be performed under regional anesthesia. During Le Fort's repair, vaginal flaps from the anterior and posterior vaginal walls are excised, and the raw areas are opposed in the midline with sutures, preventing the uterus from prolapsing. Before colpocleisis, a pap smear and endometrial biopsy are necessary, as once the vagina is obliterated, access to the cervix or endometrium will no longer be possible.</li><li>\u2022 The given scenario suggests uterine prolapse in an elderly woman found to be unfit for major surgery.</li><li>\u2022 Le Fort's repair is recommended in this case.

Here\u2019s why:</li><li>\u2022 Boiling Point and Vapor Pressure: Desflurane has a very low boiling point of 22.8\u00b0C (73\u00b0F), which means it is close to its boiling point at room temperature. This gives it a high vapor pressure, making it highly volatile. Control of Vaporization: Traditional vaporizers, which rely on the flow of carrier gas through a liquid anesthetic, are unsuitable for desflurane because of its high volatility. There is a risk of administering too high a concentration, leading to overdose. Special Vaporizer: The special vaporizer for desflurane, known as the \"Tec 6\" vaporizer, is electrically heated to maintain a constant temperature. This ensures consistent vaporization of the liquid desflurane into its vapor form, despite fluctuations in room temperature or operating room conditions.</li><li>\u2022 Boiling Point and Vapor Pressure: Desflurane has a very low boiling point of 22.8\u00b0C (73\u00b0F), which means it is close to its boiling point at room temperature.

It was developed by Dr. Fred Allman in 1967 and is a simple way to describe clavicle fractures anatomically. The classification consists of three types:</li><li>\u27a4 Type I : Middle Third Fracture</li><li>\u27a4 Type I</li><li>\u27a4 This type involves a fracture in the middle portion (shaft) of the clavicle. It is the most common type of clavicle fracture, accounting for the majority of cases. Type I fractures are often caused by direct trauma to the clavicle or a fall on the shoulder.</li><li>\u27a4 Type II : Lateral Third Fracture</li><li>\u27a4 Type II</li><li>\u27a4 Type II fractures occur in the outer third (lateral third) of the clavicle, closer to the shoulder joint. These fractures are less common than Type I fractures and are often the result of direct impact to the shoulder or a fall on an outstretched arm.</li><li>\u27a4 Type III : Medial Third Fracture</li><li>\u27a4 Type III</li><li>\u27a4 Type III fractures are located in the inner third (medial third) of the clavicle, closer to the sternum (breastbone). These fractures are the least common among the three types and can occur due to indirect forces transmitted to the clavicle, such as a blow to the chest or a fall on the back of the shoulder.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Lochia is the vaginal discharge that occurs for the first few weeks during the puerperium, the period following childbirth when the mother's body, including hormone levels and uterus size, returns to a non-pregnant state. The discharge originates from the uterine body, cervix, and vagina and is a mix of blood, mucus, and uterine tissue.</li><li>\u2022 Lochia has a peculiar offensive fishy smell and an alkaline reaction that tends to become acidic towards the end of the discharge period. Depending on the color variation of the discharge, it is categorized as follows:</li><li>\u2022 Lochia rubra (red): Occurs during the first 1-4 days postpartum and is primarily composed of blood, making it bright red in color. Lochia serosa: Occurs from days 5-9 postpartum, with the color transitioning to yellowish, pink, or pale brownish due to the decreasing amount of blood and increasing mucus and leukocytes. Lochia alba (pale white): Occurs from days 10-15 postpartum and consists mainly of white blood cells, mucus, and epithelial cells, giving it a pale white appearance.</li><li>\u2022 Lochia rubra (red): Occurs during the first 1-4 days postpartum and is primarily composed of blood, making it bright red in color.</li><li>\u2022 Lochia rubra (red):</li><li>\u2022 Lochia serosa: Occurs from days 5-9 postpartum, with the color transitioning to yellowish, pink, or pale brownish due to the decreasing amount of blood and increasing mucus and leukocytes.</li><li>\u2022 Lochia serosa:</li><li>\u2022 Lochia alba (pale white): Occurs from days 10-15 postpartum and consists mainly of white blood cells, mucus, and epithelial cells, giving it a pale white appearance.</li><li>\u2022 Lochia alba (pale white):</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 5-15 days : This duration is shorter than the average period of lochial discharge, which generally extends beyond 15 days.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 5-15 days</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 10-20 days : This duration is also shorter than the typical 24-36 days for lochial discharge.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. 10-20 days</li><li>\u2022 Option D. 36-42 days : While some women may experience lochial discharge for this duration, it is longer than the average duration of 24-36 days.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. 36-42 days</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The average duration of lochia discharge in a puerperal woman is about 24-36 days.</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Dutta\u2019s textbook of obstetrics 8 th edition Page170</li><li>\u27a4 Ref: Dutta\u2019s textbook of obstetrics 8 th edition Page170</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

It contains various important structures, including the basilar artery (a major blood vessel), the corticospinal tracts Tegmentum : The tegmentum is the dorsal part of the pons and is more rounded and swollen compared to the basilar part.

It is continuous rostrally with the medulla oblongata, just below the level of the foramen magnum and it terminates caudally as the conus medullaris, which is continuous with the filum terminale and is anchored to the dorsum of the coccyx.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.

It has several maternal side effects. Maternal hyperglycemia is a known complication of ritodrine because it stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Maternal side effects include: Headache, palpitations: Common side effects due to beta-agonist action. Tachycardia and hypotension: These cardiovascular effects are due to beta-agonist properties. Hyperglycemia: Caused by increased glucose production and decreased insulin sensitivity. Hypocalcemia: Resulting from increased calcium excretion. Hypomagnesemia: Due to increased renal excretion of magnesium. Pulmonary edema: A serious complication caused by fluid retention and increased capillary permeability. Neonatal side effects : Hypoglycemia : Occurs due to high insulin levels in response to maternal hyperglycemia. Intraventricular hemorrhage : Related to hemodynamic instability caused by tocolytic therapy. Fetal side effects : Tachycardia : Due to beta-agonist crossing the placenta.
