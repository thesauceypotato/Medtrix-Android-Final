D) Extra capsular cataract surgery</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 In extra capsular cataract extraction (ECCE), a larger incision (approximately 10 to 12 millimeters) is made at the limbus to remove the lens nucleus in one piece. Due to the size of this incision, suturing is necessary to close the wound properly. The suturing is typically performed using 10-0 nylon monofilament. This method can involve interrupted sutures or continuous suturing to ensure the wound is securely closed and to promote proper healing.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Phacoemulsification : This technique involves making a much smaller incision (around 3 millimeters or less) through which the lens is emulsified and aspirated. Suturing is generally not required because the small incision is self-sealing.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Phacoemulsification</li><li>\u2022 Suturing is generally not required</li><li>\u2022 Option B. FLACS (Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery) : This advanced technique uses a femtosecond laser to create precise incisions and to perform capsulotomy and lens fragmentation. Similar to phacoemulsification, the incisions made are small and typically do not require suturing.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. FLACS (Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery)</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Manual small incision cataract surgery (SICS) : In SICS, the incision size is between 6 to 8 millimeters. Depending on the quality of the incision and tunnel, suturing may or may not be required. Good surgical technique can often avoid the need for suturing.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.
