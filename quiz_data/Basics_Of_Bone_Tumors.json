Upon examination, she is neurologically intact but has some localized tenderness in the mid-thoracic spine. MRI with contrast demonstrates a large, uniformly enhancing epidural lesion with a significant amount of cord compression at T7 and some involvement of the posterolateral aspect of the vertebral body extending into the pedicle. Her intervertebral discs appear uninvolved. Initial blood tests are normal, including a white blood count of 7,200 WBCs/\u03bcL and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 5 mm/h (normal range 0\u201320).

The MRI indicates an epidural lesion with bone involvement but no involvement of the discs . The MRI appearance of an epidural abscess is heterogeneously enhancing epidural collection that is isointense or hypointense on T1 images but hyperintense on T2 images. The likely diagnosis from the above scenario is suggestive of Epidural lymphoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Epidural lymphoma appears isointense or hypointense on T1 and a hyperintense or hypointense appearance on T2. There tends to be uniform and diffuse gadolinium enhancement. When epidural lymphoma is suspected, tissue is needed to confirm and refine the diagnosis. Hence, a biopsy should be obtained. In this case, a biopsy of the pedicle/posterolateral vertebral body is likely.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - OPTION B. : Typical pyogenic infections usually start in the disc spaces. Thus, it would be unlikely that this patient has discitis. The features, in this case, are suggestive of Epidural lymphoma. Hence IV Antibiotics have no role. OPTION C. : The features, in this case, are suggestive of Epidural lymphoma. Hence CBC has no role; the ideal confirmatory test is a Biopsy of the lesion OPTION D. : Regarding irrigation and debridement , obtaining a diagnosis before initiating care would be preferable, especially given that the patient is neurologically intact and likely has a tumor.</p>\n<p></p>",
