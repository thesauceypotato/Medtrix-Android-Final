      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dulaglutide GLP-1 is an important incretin released from the gut in response to ingested glucose. It increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, increases satiety, suppresses glucagon secretion, and delays gastric emptying. So better to avoid GLP1 agonists in a patient with diabetic gastroparesis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>GLP-1 is an important incretin released from the gut in response to ingested glucose. It induces insulin release from pancreatic \u03b2 cells, inhibits glucagon release from \u03b1 cells , slows gastric emptying, and suppresses appetite by activating specific GLP-1 receptors , which are cell surface GPCRs expressed on \u03b2 and \u03b1 cells , central and peripheral neurons, gastrointestinal mucosa, etc. Characteristically, GLP-1 induces insulin release only at high glucose concentrations. The incretin system appears to promote \u03b2 cell health as well by decreasing islet cell apoptosis. Failure of incretins has been implicated in the pathogenesis of \u03b2 cell dysfunction of type 2 DM, particularly for the progression of the disease. GLP-1-based therapy appears to be the most effective measure to preserve \u03b2 cell function in type 2 DM.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Glimepiride - can cause hypoglycemia as a side effect. Option: B. Pioglitazone comes with a Black box warning to cause bladder cancer Option: C.
