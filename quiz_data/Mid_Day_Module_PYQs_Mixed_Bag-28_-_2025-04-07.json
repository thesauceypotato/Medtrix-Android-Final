Hartmann's operation is done in elderly debilitated patients: This statement is true. Hartmann's operation is a surgical procedure often performed in elderly or debilitated patients with rectal carcinoma.

Hartmann's operation is done in elderly debilitated patients:</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Early morning spurious diarrhea and tenesmus can occur: This statement is true. Patients with rectal carcinoma commonly experience symptoms such as diarrhea and tenesmus (a sensation of incomplete evacuation after bowel movements).
