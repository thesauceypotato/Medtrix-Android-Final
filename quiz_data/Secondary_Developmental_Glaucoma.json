      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Glaucomatocyclitic crisis This is a case of glaucomatocyclitic crisis, which is an acute, recurrent uveitis with secondary glaucoma . Patients present with unilateral mild ocular discomfort, some blurring of vision, and halos with open angles. The intraocular pressure is often between 40 and 50 mm Hg. Inflammation is minimal, with some aqueous flare, occasional cells, and a few small, flat, non pigmented keratic precipitates inferiorly.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Glaucomatocyclitic crisis attacks resolve in days to weeks, and recurrence is common.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis consists of chronic, low-grade iritis with posterior subcapsular cataract and secondary glaucoma. It is associated with a change in colour of the iris. The inflammation consists of low-grade flares and cells, with stellate keratic precipitates and fine filaments scattered over the entire endothelium. Anterior vitreous opacities and occasionally small white nodules may be present on the anterior surface of the iris. The vignette has a shorter history and no signs suggestive of cataracts or heterochromia. Option: C. Phacolytic glaucoma refers to secondary open-angle glaucoma if the lens has been damaged or if lens proteins from a hypermature senile cataract escape into the aqueous. Cortical lens matter excites a reaction by phagocytes, which engulf the lens particles. These cells are swept into the trabecular spaces by the normal current of aqueous, where they block the exit of aqueous from the eye. Option: D. Neovascular glaucoma follows extensive retinal ischaemia and is commonly seen in association with central retinal vein obstruction ( CRVO ) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. It is due to the presence of neovascularization over the iris (rubeosis iridis) and consequent fibrosis , leading to zip-like adhesions of the iris to the cornea at the angle. There is no history of CRVO or diabetes in this case.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Glaucomatocycitic crisis aka Posner-Schlossman syndrome. Management Medical Therapy: First-Line Therapy include topical beta blockers such as timolol, alpha agonists such as brimonidine, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as dorzolamide. For control of inflammation, a topical steroid drop such as prednisolone acetate 1% is used. Surgical Therapy: It is considered when medical therapy fails.</p>\n<p></p>",

Uveitic glaucoma is a form of secondary open-angle glaucoma . It results from swelling and dysfunction of the endothelial cells or infiltration and obstruction of the trabecular meshwork by inflammatory material such as white blood cell aggregates, macrophages, lymphocytes, and fibrin. This leads to a diminished outflow of aqueous with a subsequent rise in intraocular pressure. As there is no history suggestive of uveitis and with a history of CRVO, the diagnosis of neovascular glaucoma is correct . Option: B. Phacolytic glaucoma refers to secondary open-angle glaucoma if the lens has been damaged or if lens proteins from a hypermature senile cataract escape into the aqueous. Cortical lens matter excites a reaction by phagocytes, which engulf the lens particles. These cells are swept into the trabecular spaces by the normal current of aqueous, where they block the exit of aqueous from the eye.

These cells are swept into the trabecular spaces by the normal current of aqueous, where they block the exit of aqueous from the eye.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Phacotopic glaucoma occurs due to anterior subluxation or dislocation of the lens. In partial subluxation, a large segment of the angle of the anterior chamber may be compressed or blocked. In complete dislocation into the anterior chamber, the entire angle may be blocked, especially if the iris becomes firmly contracted over the posterior surface of the lens. Option: B. Phacomorphic glaucoma develops when the lens becomes intumescent, either by the rapid development of cataractous changes or after a traumatic rupture of its capsule. The swollen lens obliterates the drainage angle by forcing the root of the iris against the cornea. Option: D.
