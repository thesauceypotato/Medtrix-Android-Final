Both are not \"either/or\" concepts. Internal validity focuses on showing a difference that is due to the independent variable alone, whereas external validity results can be translated to the world at large. External validity refers to how well the outcome of a study can be expected to apply to other settings. In other words, this type of validity refers to how generalizable the findings are. Another term called transferability relates to external validity and refers to a qualitative research Transferability refers to whether results transfer to situations with similar characteristics. Internal validity is the extent to which a study establishes a trustworthy cause-and-effect relationship between a treatment and an outcome. Internal validity also reflects that a given study makes it possible to eliminate alternative explanations for a finding. The less chance there is for confounding in a study, the higher the internal validity and the more confident we can be in the findings.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options A, C and D are false.</p>\n<p></p>",

The HDI was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone. The HDI can also be used to question national policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per capita can end up with different human development outcomes. India gained in global rankings by eight points (131 st rank under HDI and 123 rd rank under PHDI), and its per capita carbon emission (production) and material footprint are well below the global average. PQLI and HDI are similar, the main difference between the two being the inclusion of income in HDI and exclusion of the same from PQLI .

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Prospective study</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Incidence can be calculated in prospective studies, examples of which are cohort studies, randomized controlled trials. Cohort studies are usually but not exclusively prospective. However, a prospective study is sometimes used as a synonym for cohort study. Incidence is a measure of the risk of developing some new condition within a specified period of time. Although sometimes loosely expressed simply as the number of new cases during some period, it is better expressed as a proportion or a rate with a denominator. So in a case-control study incidence (as well as relative risk) cannot be calculated as there is no appropriate denominator or population at risk, to calculate these rates.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option B. A retrospective cohort study is one in which the outcomes have all occurred before the time of investigation. Option C. The case control method has 3 distinct features: both exposure and outcome have occurred before the start of the study. The study proceeds backwards from effect to cause. It uses a control or comparison group to support or refute an inference.</p>\n<p></p>",
