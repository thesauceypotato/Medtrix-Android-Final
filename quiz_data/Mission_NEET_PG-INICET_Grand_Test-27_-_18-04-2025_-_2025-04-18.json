Regarding hepatitis viruses and their clinical implications, which of the following statements are incorrect? Hepatitis A virus is associated with chronic liver disease and is commonly acquired via blood transfusion. Hepatitis E infection is particularly severe in pregnant women and may lead to fulminant liver failure. Hepatitis C is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route and carries a high risk of progression to chronic hepatitis. Hepatitis B and D can coinfect simultaneously or HDV can superinfect an HBV carrier; superinfection tends to be more severe. Hepatitis B is parenterally transmitted and causes chronic infection in a minority of patients.",

Its clearance is equal to the glomerular filtration rate: Clearance equals glomerular filtration rate (GFR) only if the substance is freely filtered and neither reabsorbed nor secreted (e.g., inulin ).
