It is a motile, Gram-negative bacillus that is facultatively anaerobic and able to ferment both lactose and glucose. Most strains of E coli also demonstrate beta-hemolysis on blood agar. E coli is responsible for urinary tract infections (UTIs), neonatal meningitis, and several types of gastroenteritis. The virulence factors expressed by a particular strain of E coli will determine disease characteristics. Fimbriae, or pili (Type 1 fimbriae, P fimbriae, and S fimbriae), are one of the most important virulence factors expressed by E coli. They permit the adhesion of E coli to epithelial cells, uroepithelial cells, and enterocytes. During sexual intercourse or bladder catheterization, E coli can be propelled into the urethra and bladder from the colonized periurethral region. P-fimbriae (pyelonephritis-associated pili) adhesion then allows uropathogenic E coli to colonize the bladder and ureters, causing cystitis and pyelonephritis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A: E coli strains causing neonatal meningitis to synthesize K1 capsular antigens.

Option B: Enterotoxigenic E coli produce heat-stable (ST) and/or heat-labile (LT) enterotoxins. ST activates guanylate cyclase, causing an increase in cGMP. LT activates adenylate cyclase, increasing cAMP levels. In both structure and mode of action, LT is very similar to the cholera toxin.

Signs of sepsis include hyper- or hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea (can lead to respiratory alkalosis}, and leukocytosis. Severe sepsis is marked by organ dysfunction due to poor blood flow (eg, oliguria from poor renal perfusion and altered mental status from poor cerebral perfusion). Diagnosis is done by clinical (qSOFA Score ) and laboratory tests (TLC, CRP, Procalcitonin, Blood culture, etc.). Metabolic lactic acidosis can be seen, particularly during the late stages, due to poor tissue perfusion. Treatment is focused on maintaining blood pressure and organ perfusion with intravenous fluids, administering antibiotics as per the offending organism, and maintaining proper ventilation and oxygenation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option B: Many microorganisms inhabit the human GI tract as normal flora. Under normal circumstances, small intestine bacteria do not cause systemic disease. Anaerobic or gram-negative rod bacteremia can result from colonic perforation due to surgery, trauma, or wall rupture from certain pathologic processes. However, the likely site of infection in this patient with E coli bacteremia is the genitourinary tract; although it may represent the ultimate site of origin of E coli, the GI tract is not typically a site of infection. Option C: Normal skin flora includes mostly gram-positive organisms such as staphylococci and streptococci. Option D: Bacterial causes of upper respiratory tract infection (eg, Moraxella and Haemophilus) do not usually cause disseminated disease. E coli and other gram-negative rods (Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Klebsiella) would be common causes of healthcare-acquired pneumonia in this nursing home resident; from the lungs, these organisms can easily gain access to the bloodstream and cause sepsis.
