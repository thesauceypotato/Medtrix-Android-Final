      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>NOD 2 Crohn's disease is associated with NOD2 , which is also known as the CARD15 gene. NOD2 encodes for a protein involved in the innate immune system that recognizes bacterial components and triggers an inflammatory response. (activates signaling events, including the NF-\u03baB pathway) Mutations in the NOD2 gene have been found to be more common in individuals with Crohn's disease compared to the general population</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. NKG2D: It is a receptor expressed on the surface of natural killer cells and some T cells. It plays a role in recognizing and eliminating cells that express stress-induced proteins, such as those found on tumor cells.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Crohn's disease The given clinical history of chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss, in combination with the finding of yellowish exudates at multiple site s seen in colonoscopy, is suggestive of Crohn's disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Histopathological features of Cronh\u2019s disease: Transmural inflammation : Inflammation involves all layers of the intestinal wall, from the inner mucosal layer to the outer serosal layer. Skip lesions : Crohn's disease can involve patchy areas of inflammation with healthy tissue in between. These areas of inflammation are known as skip lesions. Non-caseating granulomas : One of the hallmark histopathological features.These are small clusters of immune cells, such as macrophages and lymphocytes, that form in response to chronic inflammation. Crypt distortion and atrophy : Like ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease can cause distortion and atrophy of the crypts in the intestinal mucosal layer. Fibrosis and strictures : These strictures can cause bowel obstruction and other complications. Abscesses and fistulas</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Hirschsprung disease: It is a congenital disorder that affects the large intestine, leading to bowel obstruction and constipation. Option: C. Tuberculosis: It can cause granulomatous inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, but this is usually associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and fatigue. The presentation and colonoscopy findings, in this case, are not consistent with tuberculosis. Option: D. Lymphoma: It can also present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea, but the finding of yellowish exudates on colonoscopy is not typical for lymphoma.</p>\n<p></p>",
