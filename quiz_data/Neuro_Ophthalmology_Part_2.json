With dim background lighting, the pupils are equal and relatively large. Shining a flashlight into the right eye evokes equal, strong constriction of both pupils. Swinging the flashlight over to the damaged left eye causes dilation of both pupils, although they remain smaller than in A. Swinging the flashlight back over to the healthy right eye would result in symmetric constriction back to the appearance shown in B. Note that the pupils always remain equal; the damage to the left retina/ optic nerve is revealed by weaker bilateral pupil constriction to a flashlight in the left eye compared with the right eye</p>\n<p></p>",
