Microscopically, ccRCC usually consists of tumour cells with clear cytoplasm arranged in nests or tubules surrounded by a rich vascular network. The transparent appearance of the cytoplasm is due to the accumulation of glycogen and lipids. The most widely used grading system for ccRCC is the Fuhrman grading system, which defines four nuclear grades (1\u20134) in order of increasing atomic size, irregularity & nucleolar prominence. The pathologist also often assigns a Leibovich score following nephrectomy \u2013 the Leibovich prognostic score runs from 0 to 11 and is based on the tumour\u2019s stage, grade, size, involvement of lymph nodes and the presence of tumour necrosis histologically.

The RCC TNM staging system clearly distinguishes between patient groups with different predicted cancer-specific outcomes confirming that the extent of locoregional or systemic disease at diagnosis is the primary determinant of products for this disease.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The treatment and prognosis of RCC depend on its pathological staging. The most important factors are the size of the tumour and whether it is confined within the renal capsule and Gerota\u2019s fascia. Involvement of the lymph nodes, renal sinus and vein wall is associated with a poorer prognosis than the presence of tumour thrombus in the renal vein or IVC. Currently, the most commonly used system for staging RCC is the TNM. ccRCC is histologically an adenocarcinoma arising from the proximal renal tubular epithelium. They are slow growing and bulge out of the renal contour. Most are solitary, but bilateral and multiple tumours are found in familial RCC. The prognosis of ccRCC varies depending on histopathological features, such as nuclear grading. Other histological variants are papillary RCC, chromophobe RCC and, rarely, collecting duct carcinoma and renal medullary carcinoma. The tumour can spread directly, invading the perinephric tissue through the capsule or, at times, extending into the renal vein as a tumour thrombus. Vein wall invasion is associated with poor prognosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Prognostic factors \u25cf Pathologic stage is single most important prognostic factor \u25cf Lymph node involvement is a poor prognostic factor Staging and grading \u25cf TNM (preferred) and Robson's staging are used for RCC \u25cf Fuhrman histological system is used for grading</p>\n<p></p>",
