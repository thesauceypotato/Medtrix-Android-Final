      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Accommodative Esotropia Accommodative esotropia- occurs due to the overaction of convergence associated with accommodation reflex. Accommodative esotropia is the most common type of squint in children (previously, it was believed that congenital esotropia was most common). When esotropia develops around 2-3 years of age, it is most likely accommodative.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>It is of three types: refractive. non-refractive and mixed. i. Refractive accommodative esotropia : It usually develops at the age of 2 to 3 years and is associated with high hypermetropia (+4 to +7 D). Mostly it is for near and distance (marginally more for near) and fully correctable by use of spectacles ii. Non-refractive accommodative esotropia : It is caused by an abnormal AC/A (accommodative convergence/accommodation) ratio. This may occur even in patients with no refractive error. Esotropia is greater for near than that for distance (minimal or no deviation for distance). It is fully corrected by bifocal glasses with add +3 DS for near vision. Miotics may be useful in younger children not suitable for bifocals. Miotics facilitate accommodation and thus reduce the accommodative convergence. iii. Mixed accommodative esotropia : It is caused by a combination of hypermetropia and a high AC/A ratio . Esotropia for distance is corrected by correction of hypermetropia; and the residual esotropia for near is corrected by an addition of a +3 DS lens.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. Consecutive esotropia Consecutive esotropias refer to a convergent strabismus that has developed following surgery for an exotropia. This is relatively rare but can happen following surgery for an intermittent distance exotropia Option: C. Infantile esotropia Infantile esotropia is a form of ocular motility disorder in which there is an inward turning of one or both eyes, commonly referred to as \"crossed eyes\". Infantile esotropia is esotropia that occurs during the first 6 months of life in an otherwise neurologically normal child. Option: D. Sensory esotropia Sensory exotropia is a condition of unilateral divergence as a sequela to loss of vision or long-standing poor vision in one eye, caused by refractive errors, unilateral aphakia or other organic reasons.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Esotropia for distance is corrected by the treatment of hypermetropia: conv359ex glasses Esotropia for near is corrected by +3DS lens. The algorithm for the management of accommodative esotropia is as follows: R: Refractive correction: Glasses/Miotics</p>\n<p></p>",
