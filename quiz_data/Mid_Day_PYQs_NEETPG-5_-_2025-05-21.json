It typically occurs after delivery or abortion and is often seen in women with risk factors like cesarean section, prolonged labor, or pelvic infection.</li><li>\u2022 The fever in SPT is caused by a septic thrombus in the pelvic veins\u2014most commonly the ovarian vein\u2014that harbors bacteria and incites a sustained inflammatory response. Since antibiotics alone cannot fully penetrate the infected thrombus, the addition of anticoagulation (usually low molecular weight heparin) is essential. Heparin helps in lysing the thrombus, preventing further propagation and improving antibiotic penetration.</li><li>\u2022 Clinical improvement is usually seen within 48\u201372 hours of initiating combined therapy with antibiotics and heparin.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Stop antibiotics and start heparin :  Incorrect because infection is still present\u2014antibiotics are needed to control the infective component.  Stopping antibiotics would worsen sepsis.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Stop antibiotics and start heparin</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Surgical embolectomy: Too invasive and not first-line.  Reserved for rare cases with septic emboli or failure to respond to medical management.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Surgical embolectomy:</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Hysterectomy: Not indicated unless there\u2019s uncontrolled pelvic infection not responding to medical therapy or associated endomyometritis with uterine necrosis.  SPT is usually confined to pelvic veins, not requiring removal of the uterus.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
