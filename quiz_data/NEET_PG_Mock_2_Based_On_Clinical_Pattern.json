With this assessment tool, if the responses to all questions are negative, the estimated prevalence of PE is only 10%. You also know that a D-dimer enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 50% for the diagnosis of PE in an ambulatory care setting. If you used this ELISA D-dimer test as part of your algorithm to clarify the diagnosis in this low-prevalence group, what percentage of that group who test positive would actually have a confirmed PE?",

On the basis of this information, how many patients need to be treated for 6 months with subcutaneous LMWH to prevent one additional VTE?",
