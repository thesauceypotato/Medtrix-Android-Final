      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Uterotonic drugs Active management of labour includes Administration of a uterotonic soon after the birth of baby Delayed cord clamping Delivery of placenta by controlled cord traction Uterine massage In the AMTSL guidelines, the most important step is the administration of uterotonic agents like oxytocin (most important), misoprostol and ergots majorly along with other substitutes. All other options are also components of AMTSL but their importance in comparison to uterotonic is limited .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Uterine tone assessment is important to know the cause of the PPH if it is atony. In other words, normal tone rules out atonic PPH , and we should look for other causes. Option: B. controlled cord traction does lower the manual placenta removal rates and shorten the third stage of labour but is less effective to prevent haemorrhage compared to medical management. Option: D . Delayed cord clamping- it does not raise postpartum haemorrhage rates, and the early component is of less importance now. And it also gives the benefit of extra blood supplied to the fetus to prevent anaemia and other complications.</p>\n<p></p>",

In cases of delay beyond 24 hours , the complete tear should be repaired after 3 months . Repair of first and second-degree tears: is similar to repair of episiotomy . Repair of third and fourth-degree tears: Their repair is of prime importance as uncorrected tears may lead to faecal incontinence . The rectal mucosa is first repaired followed by the disrupted ends of the anal sphincter (both the internal and external sphincter). Then the remaining repair is carried out as in any other second-degree perineal tear.</p>\n<p></p>",
