      "explanation": "<p><strong>Ans. C)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 Pulmonary plethora refers to an increased blood flow to the lungs, which can be identified on a chest radiograph. One objective sign of pulmonary plethora is the measurement of the diameter of the descending right pulmonary artery. If the diameter exceeds 16 mm, it is indicative of increased pulmonary blood flow, suggesting pulmonary plethora.</li><li>\u2022 The descending right pulmonary artery is a key structure evaluated in chest radiographs when assessing for signs of pulmonary congestion or increased blood flow. Measurements greater than 16 mm suggest that the pulmonary vascular system is under increased pressure or volume, which is a hallmark of pulmonary plethora.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A . Diameter of the main pulmonary artery > 16 mm: While the main pulmonary artery's diameter is relevant in assessing overall pulmonary artery pressure, it is not as specific for identifying pulmonary plethora as the descending right pulmonary artery.</li><li>\u2022 Option</li><li>\u2022 A</li><li>\u2022 Diameter of the main pulmonary artery > 16 mm:</li><li>\u2022 Option B .
