It is highly selective for \u03b11 receptors and typically 1000-fold less potent at \u03b12 receptors. This may partially explain the relative absence of tachycardia seen with prazosin compared with that of phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine. Prazosin relaxes both arterial and venous vascular smooth muscle , as well as smooth muscle in the prostate, due to blockade of \u03b11 receptors</p>\n<p></p>",

This drug-receptor complex specifically and competitively binds to and inhibits calcineurin, in turn inhibits the translocation of a family of transcription factors (NF-AT) , leading to reduced transcriptional activation of cytokine genes for interleukin (|L-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-3, IL-4, CD40L, granulocyte- macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interferon-gamma. Ultimately, the proliferation of T lymphocytes is reduced, resulting in immunomodulation. Mechanisms of Cyclosporine induced Cholestasis It is mediated through MDR1 receptor, competitive inhibition of ATP transporters , intrahepatic vesicle transport inhibition, targeting of ATP dependent transporters to the apical (canalicular) membrane, and i mpairment of bile excretion by increasing membrane fluidity without affecting the expression of canalicular transporters1 . Cyclosporine also binds to cyclophilin to produce its therapeutic effects, and the resulting complex inhibits calcineurin , causing calcium to accumulate in the mitochondria. Accumulating calcium with concomitant mitochondrial abnormalities induces oxidative stress, perturbation in ATP balance , and failure of calcium pumps.</p>\n<p></p>",

Caution should be taken in people with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) , as they were excluded from clinical trials, since the drug can cause severe ILD or pneumonitis. Caution should also be taken in people with a predisposition to long QT syndrome as the drug can provoke this. ADVERSE EFFECT Very common (greater than 10% of clinical trial subjects) Adverse effects include diarrhea, stomatitis, rashes, dry or itchy skin, infections, low platelet counts , low leukocyte counts, and low neutrophil counts. Common (between 1% and 10% of clinical trial subjects) adverse effects include interstitial lung disease</p>\n<p></p>",

Babies born with malformations such as amelia, phocomelia, bone hypoplasia and absence of bones resulted from the thalidomide tragedy. MECHANISM OF ACTION: The main theories were inhibition of the process of angiogenesis , its inhibition of cereblon, a ubiquitin ligase, and its ability to generate reactive oxygen species results were first published which suggested that thalidomide's teratogenic effects are mediated through degradation of the transcription factor, SALL4, Thalidomide also binds to and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR) and hence is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) of some capacity. In accordance, it can produce gynecomastia and sexual dysfunction as side effects in men Thalidomide is used in the treatment of: Multiple myeloma and lepra reaction.</p>\n<p></p>",
