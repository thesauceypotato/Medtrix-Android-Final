Hyaline membranes are formed due to the accumulation of plasma proteins and cellular debris in the alveoli, resulting in damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier. Inflammation : ARDS is characterized by an inflammatory response in the lungs, which is indicated by the presence of neutrophils and macrophages in the alveoli and interstitial spaces. Edema : The alveolar-capillary barrier in the lungs becomes leaky in ARDS, leading to the accumulation of fluid in the alveoli and interstitial spaces, which is known as pulmonary edema. Alveolar damage : The histopathological features of ARDS include damage to the alveolar walls, leading to the collapse of the alveoli and impaired gas exchange in the lungs. Fibrosis : In some cases of ARDS, there may be the development of fibrosis (scarring) in the lungs, which can lead to long-term respiratory problems. https://images.app.goo.gl/BbY2go5WsikXVKyr7</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option A,B & D: All are incorrect.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Phases of ARDS Phase Duration Features Exudative Day 1-7 Alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation, interstitial edema, alveolar flooding, and surfactant depletion Proliferative Day 7-21 Inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts migrate to the alveoli, leading to fibrosis and collagen deposition Fibrotic Beyond day 21 Fibrosis, scarring, and remodeling of the lung tissue, leading to irreversible lung damage and impaired gas exchange</p>\n<p></p>",
