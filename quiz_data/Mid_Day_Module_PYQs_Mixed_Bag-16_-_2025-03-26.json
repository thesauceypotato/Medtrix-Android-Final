It gives rise to the axillary nerve, which innervates the deltoid muscle. Damage or compression of the C5 nerve root or axillary nerve can result in weakness or paralysis of the deltoid muscle, leading to difficulty in abducting the arm.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. C4: The C4 spinal nerve does not directly innervate the muscles responsible for shoulder abduction. It primarily supplies sensory information to areas of the neck and upper shoulders.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. C4:</li><li>\u2022 Option C . C6: The C6 spinal nerve primarily innervates the muscles responsible for elbow flexion and wrist extension, not shoulder abduction. Damage to the C6 nerve root would affect these functions rather than shoulder abduction.</li><li>\u2022 Option C</li><li>\u2022 C6:</li><li>\u2022 Option D .

Scalp, dura, arachnoid</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 The arrow in the illustration, which displays a baby's skull, is pointing in the direction of the anterior fontanelle. Ventricular tapping is the term used to describe the process of removing CSF from the anterior fontanelle. The various structures pierced are the scalp, dura, and arachnoid.</li><li>\u2022 Fontanelle tap/ Percutaneous ventricular puncture:</li><li>\u2022 Fontanelle tap/ Percutaneous ventricular puncture:</li><li>\u2022 Infants who need urgent ventricular decompression and have an open anterior fontanelle and no access to a VP shunt undergo a fontanelle tap or percutaneous ventricular puncture. A butterfly needle is used to immediately puncture the infant's open fontanelle and enter the lateral ventricle in order to obtain CS samples, alleviate pressure, or insert a drain or catheter.</li><li>\u2022 Procedure: A 25-gauge butterfly needle is inserted through the anterolateral aspect of the anterior fontanelle (away from the midline, avoiding the superior sagittal sinus).</li><li>\u2022 When performing a fontanelle tap, the following layers are pierced:</li><li>\u2022 Scalp : This includes the skin and the underlying connective tissue of the scalp. Membranous fontanelle : The actual fontanelle is a soft spot on a baby's head where the bones of the skull have not yet fused together. It's a membranous gap between the cranial bones. Dura mater : The tough outermost membrane of the three layers of the meninges that surround the brain and spinal cord. Arachnoid mater : A thin, wispy layer that lies underneath the dura mater. Pia mater : The innermost layer of the meninges that's in direct contact with the brain's surface. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) : Once through the pia mater, the needle enters the subarachnoid space where the CSF is located.</li><li>\u2022 Scalp : This includes the skin and the underlying connective tissue of the scalp.</li><li>\u2022 Scalp</li><li>\u2022 Membranous fontanelle : The actual fontanelle is a soft spot on a baby's head where the bones of the skull have not yet fused together.

However, as the child grows, these fontanelles close, and the method is no longer viable.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 Fontanelle tap is a critical emergency procedure used in infants for CSF sampling or pressure relief from the ventricles, exploiting the unossified sections of the skull for direct access to the CSF. This procedure is unique to neonates and young infants where the fontanelle is present and typically involves piercing the scalp, dura, and arachnoid layers.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
