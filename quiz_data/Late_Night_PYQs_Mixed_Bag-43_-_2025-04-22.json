A negative antibody test indicates that the woman is not immune to VZV and is susceptible to chickenpox. If a pregnant woman is not immune and has had significant exposure, she is at risk of developing chickenpox and should be administered varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG). VZIG is effective up to 10 days after contact. Symptomatic treatment of chickenpox in pregnancy includes: Oral Acyclovir if within 24 hours of the onset of the rash and if the gestational age is greater than 20 weeks. Intravenous Acyclovir should be given to all pregnant women with severe chickenpox. VZIG has no therapeutic benefit once chickenpox has started. Women who develop chickenpox in pregnancy should be referred to a fetal medicine specialist at 16\u201320 weeks or 5 weeks after infection to look for congenital varicella syndrome. If the infection occurs in the last 4 weeks of pregnancy, there is a risk of varicella infection in the newborn. Planned delivery should normally be avoided for at least 7 days after the onset of the maternal rash to allow for the passive transfer of antibodies from mother to child.</li><li>\u2022 Pregnant women with uncertain or no previous history of chickenpox, who have been exposed to the infection, should have a blood test to determine their immunity to Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV).</li><li>\u2022 A negative antibody test indicates that the woman is not immune to VZV and is susceptible to chickenpox.</li><li>\u2022 If a pregnant woman is not immune and has had significant exposure, she is at risk of developing chickenpox and should be administered varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG).</li><li>\u2022 VZIG is effective up to 10 days after contact.</li><li>\u2022 Symptomatic treatment of chickenpox in pregnancy includes: Oral Acyclovir if within 24 hours of the onset of the rash and if the gestational age is greater than 20 weeks.
