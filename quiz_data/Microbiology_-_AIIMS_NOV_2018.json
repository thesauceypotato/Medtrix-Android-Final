V. parahaemolyticus is a capsulated vibrio with peritrichous flagella. Infections with V. parahaemolyticus can result in two distinct gastrointestinal presentations (including nearly all cases in North America). The most common presentation is watery diarrhea, usually occurring in conjunction with abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting and accompanied in \uf07e25% of cases by fever and chills. Dysentery, the less common presentation, is characterized by severe abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and bloody or mucoid stools. V. parahaemolyticus contains two type III secretion systems, which directly inject toxic bacterial proteins into host cells. After an incubation period of 4 hours to 4 days, symptoms develop and persist for a median of 3 days. V. parahaemolyticus is linked to its ability to cause hemolysis on Wagatsuma agar), i.e., is called Kanagawa phenomenon. Doxycycline, fluoroquinolones, or macrolides are preferred in this case.

It is the mildest form of diphtheria. Diphtheria: It is the most common type of diphtheria which appears as area of yellow or dirty white exudate adjacent to tonsils which later join to form pseudomembrane on the mucous membranes of the pharynx, tonsils, and vulva. After few days the pseudomembrane changes to greyish color because of hemorrhage. Initially, the patient presents with sore throat and fever but in later stages dysphagia, headache and voice change can be seen. The enlargement of lymph node and soft tissue edema gives the appearance of \u201cBull neck.\u201d Bull\u2019s neck vs. Bull\u2019s eye Bull\u2019s neck: Seen in tonsillopharyngeal diphtheria. Bull\u2019s eye retinopathy: Adverse effect of chloroquine. Laryngotracheal diphtheria : These patients have high chances of developing suffocation because of edema of soft tissue and dense cast of respiratory epithelium. Resection of pseudomembrane and establishment of artificial airway should be done. Cutaneous diphtheria : It is characterized by nothing but punched out ulcer with brown grey membrane. It is caused by nontoxigenic strains. Extremities are most commonly affected. Mucocutaneous sites like ear and genital tract are rarely affected. Complication of diphtheria : Airway obstruction by pseudomembrane is commonly seen. The orders of complications are: Airway obstruction > Toxic cardiomyopathy (Occurs during 2\u20133 week of illness) > Toxic neuropathy (10 days to 3 month) > Encephalitis. Most common complication of diphtheria is respiratory obstruction followed by death. Isolated peripheral nerve palsies or a symptom complex mimicking Guillain\u2013 Barre syndrome and degenerative changes in the nervous system can be seen. Pneumonia, renal failure, encephalitis, cerebral infarction, and pulmonary embolism also can be seen. Treatment Diphtheria antitoxin is administered empirically based on the estimated amount of toxin present. Penicillin G or erythromycin is generally given to render the patient noncontagious. Antibiotics do not affect the course of disease.</p>\n<p></p>",
