      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>PRSS 1 Hereditary pancreatitis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis that can progress to chronic pancreatitis. The majority of cases of hereditary pancreatitis are caused by mutations in the PRSS1 gene , which provides instructions for making an enzyme called cationic trypsinogen. Mutations in the PRSS1 gene can cause the enzyme to become overactive , leading to inflammation and damage to pancreatic tissue.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B. SPINK 1:Mutations in the SPINK1 gene can impair the function of the protein pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, leading to increased trypsin activity and pancreatic damage. But it is less common than PRSS1 Option: C. CASR: Mutations in the CASR gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing pancreatitis, but their exact role in the development of hereditary pancreatitis is not well understood. Option:D. CFTR: Mutations in the CFTR gene can disrupt the normal functioning of the pancreas and lead to the development of pancreatitis.</p>\n<p></p>",

Fat necrosis : The pancreas shows fat necrosis, which is the breakdown of fat cells and the release of fatty acids into the surrounding tissue.
