Surfactant is a liquid made by the lungs that keeps the airways (alveoli) open. Pulmonary surfactant is a surface-active lipoprotein complex (phospholipoprotein) formed by type II alveolar cells. The proteins and lipids that make up the surfactant have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. By adsorbing to the air-water interface of alveoli, with hydrophilic head groups in the water and the hydrophobic tails facing towards the air, the main lipid component of surfactant is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC).</li><li>\u27a4 Ref- Harper 31st ed pg \u2013 234</li><li>\u27a4 Ref- Harper 31st ed pg \u2013 234</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
