Nitrox with an oxygen content above 21% , is mainly used in scuba diving to reduce the proportion of nitrogen in the breathing gas mixture. The main benefit is reduced decompression risk. Option B. Nitrates cause a redistribution of blood flow without affecting total coronary flow. Autoregulatory small vessels remain unaffected whereas large conducting vessels are dilated. Nitrates are predominantly venodilators, therefore decreasing mainly preload. Option C. It causes dilation of small blood vessels and can result in flushing and hypotension. Fall in blood pressure is mediated by both H, (early; by release of NO) as well as H\u2082 (delayed and persistent; direct action on smooth muscles of blood vessels) receptors. It increases capillary permeability and results in edema through stimulation of H, receptors. The intradermal injection may result in a triple response consisting of a red reaction (due to vasodilation), wheal (exudation of fluid due to increased permeability), and flare (spreading redness due to axon reflex). It is primarily a H\u2081 response.</p>\n<p></p>",
