Fossa Ovalis is a communication via which blood flows from right to left atrium during embryonic life.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The interatrial septum is formed by two septa\u2014 septum primum and septum secundum. Septum primum starts developing from the roof of the primitive atrial chamber a little to the left of the opening of sinus venosus. It grows downward towards the septum intermedium (AV septum). The gap between the lower edge of septum primum and septum intermedium is called foramen primum . As septum primum fuses with the AV septum (septum intermedium), the upper part of septum primum breaks down. The foramen thus formed is called foramen secundum (ostium secundum). A second crescent-shaped septum now arises from the roof of the primitive atrial chamber immediately to the right of the septum primum. It is called septum secundum . The septum secundum grows downward towards the septum intermedium. It overlaps the foramen secundum. The right and left atria now communicate with each other through an oblique valvular passage between the upper margin of septum primum and lower margin of septum secundum. This passage is called foramen ovale . The interatrial septum is thus formed by two septa: (a) septum primum that forms the lower part of interatrial septum; and (b) septum secundum that forms the upper part of interatrial septum.

Septum primum is the thin and mobile-like flap, while septum secundum (crista dividens) is thick, firm, and immo- bile. When blood accumulates in the right atrium, it pushes the septum primum towards the left and foramen ovale opens, and blood flows from the right atrium to the left atrium. When the blood flows from the right to the left atrium, the thin flap of septum primum moves away, and there is no obstruction to the blood flow. But after birth, the left atrium receives blood from the lungs and pressure within it becomes greater than that in the right atrium. As the pressure of blood in the left atrium increases, it pushes the septum pri- mum to the right. It comes in opposition with septum secundum and foramen ovale is closed (physiological closure); thus, the blood is prevented from flowing from the left atrium to the right atrium.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>All of the above The given condition is a case of Ventricular Septal defect</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>VSD is an acyanotic congenital heart defect, also known as a left-to-right shunt, so there are no signs of cyanosis in the early stage. However, uncorrected VSD can increase pulmonary resistance leading to the reversal of the shunt and corresponding cyanosis. In the setting of long-standing large left-to-right shunts, the pulmonary vascular endothelium undergoes irreversible changes resulting in persistent PAH. When the pressure in the pulmonary circulation exceeds the pressure in the systemic circulation, the shunt direction reverses and becomes a right-to-left shunt. This is known as Eisenmenger syndrome, and it occurs in 10% to 15% of patients with VSD.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for all options: - Option A . The most common defect of the ventricular septum occurs around the expected site of the membranous septum in the right wall of the aortic vestibule, below the zone of apposition between the non-coronary and right coronary leaflets of the aortic valve. A ventricular septal defect ( VSD ) is a defect in the ventricular septum, the wall dividing the left and right ventricles of the heart. The extent of the opening may vary from pin size to the complete absence of the ventricular septum, creating one common ventricle. The membranous portion, which is close to the atrioventricular node, is most commonly affected. It is also the type that will most commonly require surgical intervention, comprising over 80% of cases. (Membranous) This VSD is, by far, the most common type, accounting for 80% of all defects. It is located in the membranous septum inferior to the crista supraventricularis. It often involves the muscular septum which it is commonly known as perimembranous. The septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve sometimes forms a \u201cpouch\u201d that reduces the shunt and can result in spontaneous closure. Membranous VSDs usually represent a more serious defect and are often associated with abnormalities in the partitioning of the conotruncal region. Depending on the size of the opening, blood carried by the pulmonary artery may be 1.2 to 1.7 times as abundant as that carried by the aorta. Membranous ventricular septal defects are more common than muscular ventricular septal defects, and are the most common congenital cardiac anomaly. Option B . Ventricular septum is incompletely closed by its membranous component Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common congenital cardiac anomaly in children and is the second most common congenital abnormality in adults, second only to a bicuspid aortic valve. An abnormal communication between the right and left ventricles and shunt formation is the main mechanism of hemodynamic compromise in VSD. While many VSDs close spontaneously, if they do not, large defects can lead to detrimental complications such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) , ventricular dysfunction, and an increased risk of arrhythmias. Option C. It is often associated with the overriding of the crest of the muscular septum by the aortic orifice, together with pulmonary stenosis or atresia and hypertrophy of the right ventricle ( Fallot\u2019s tetralogy) VSD develops when there is a developmental abnormality or an interruption of the interventricular septum formation during the complex embryologic heart morphogenesis. VSDs are frequently isolated; however, they can occur in association with other congenital heart defects such as atrial septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, right aortic arch, and pulmonic stenosis. They are also found in cases of aortic coarctation and subaortic stenosis, and they are a frequent component of complex congenital heart disease such as Tetralogy of Fallot and transposition of great arteries Therefore Option D (all of the above ) is the correct answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>A TBX5 mutation was recently discovered to cause septal defects in patients with Holt-Oram syndrome. Non-inherited risk factors have been implicated in the development of VSDs; these include maternal infection (rubella, influenza, and febrile illness), maternal diabetes mellitus, and phenylketonuria. Exposure to toxins like alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and certain medications such as metronidazole and ibuprofen are also linked to VSD.</p>\n<p></p>",

The given condition is an atrial septal defect and is due to failure of the flap valve of the primary atrial septum to fuse with the infolded muscular rims of the fossa. ASD is a congenital heart abnormality with an incidence of 6.4/10,000 births and with a 2:1 prevalence in female to male infants. One of the most significant defects is the ostium secundum defect, characterized by a large opening between the left and right atria. It may be caused by excessive cell death and resorption of the septum primum or by inadequate development of the septum secundum . Depending on the size of the opening, considerable intracardiac shunting may occur from left to right. Secundum defects are holes in the true atrial septum i.e., ASDs. They are located in the flap valve covering the oval fossa, the \u201cseptum primum\u201d . Termed secundum defects, due to the persistence of the embryonic \u201costium secundum\u201d, the defects are often larger than the embryonic communication and involve deficiency of the valve itself. It is, therefore, more accurate to term such defects oval fossa defects. They vary in size from small perforations to the complete absence of the valve guarding the oval fossa.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The most serious abnormality in this group is the complete absence of the atrial septum. This condition, known as a common atrium or cor trilocular biventricular , is always associated with serious defects elsewhere in the heart.

Tetralogy of Fallot is a combination of four congenital heart defects. The four defects are a ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary stenosis, a misplaced aorta and a thickened right ventricular wall (right ventricular hypertrophy). They usually result in a lack of oxygen-rich blood reaching the body. If tetralogy of fallot is associated with ASD, It is known as Pentology of fallot.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Fallot\u2019s tetralogy At birth, children may be asymptomatic or present with many severe symptoms. Later in infancy, there are typically episodes of bluish colour to the skin due to a lack of sufficient oxygenation, known as cyanosis. When affected babies cry or have a bowel movement, they may undergo a \"tet spell\" where they turn cyanotic, have difficulty breathing, become limp, and occasionally lose consciousness. Other symptoms may include a heart murmur, finger clubbing, and easy tiring upon breastfeeding.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option A. Atrial Septal Defect Cyanosis in a patient with an atrial septal defect (ASD) is uncommon, but It can result in the development of right-to-left (R-L) shunt across an ASD initially shunting left to right (L-R) in view of elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressures, as in Eisenmenger's syndrome . Option B. ventricular septal defect Small VSDs only lead to the minimal left-to-right shunt without left ventricular (LV) fluid overload or PAH; they are usually asymptomatic or found incidentally on physical exam. A septal aneurysm's systolic click can sometimes be appreciated in membranous defects. Eisenmenger syndrome manifests in cyanosis, desaturation, dyspnea, syncope, secondary erythrocytosis, and clubbing; in such cases, the typical murmur of VSD can be absent, and accentuated pulmonic component of the second heart sound may be heard. Option C. patent ductus arteriosus A small patent ductus arteriosus often doesn't cause problems and might never need treatment. However, a large, untreated patent ductus arteriosus can let oxygen-poor blood move the wrong way. This can weaken the heart muscle, causing heart failure and other complications.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Genetic factors linked to TOF include various gene mutations or deletions.
