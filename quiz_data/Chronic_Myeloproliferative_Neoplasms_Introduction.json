      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Dohle bodies In sepsis or severe inflammatory disorders (e.g., Kawasaki disease), leukocytosis can have morphologic changes in the neutrophils : Cytoplasmic vacuoles Toxic granules, which are coarser and darker than the normal neutrophilic granules, represent abnormal azurophilic (primary) granules. D\u00f6hle bodies are patches of the dilated endoplasmic reticulum that appear as sky-blue cytoplasmic \u201cpuddles\u201d D\u00f6hle bodies are seen in Myelodysplastic syndromes Sepsis Chediak Higashi syndrome Reactive changes in neutrophils. Neutrophils containing coarse purple cytoplasmic granules (toxic granulations) and blue cytoplasmic patches of dilated endoplasmic reticulum (D\u00f6hle bodies) (arrow) are observed in this peripheral blood smear prepared from a patient with bacterial sepsis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Asteroid bodies. Asteroid bodies : stellate/ star-shaped inclusions in giant cells seen in Sarcoidosis . Option: B. Auer bodies. Cytoplasmic rod-shaped structures are found in immature myeloid cells (known as faggot cells ). The bodies occur in acute myeloid leukaemia (M3) and are thought to be abnormal lysosomes. They contain the enzymes peroxidase and acid phosphatase and stain red with azure eosin. Can activate the coagulation pathway and can initiate DIC . Option: C. Birbeck bodies. These granules are shaped like rods or tennis rackets with a central linear density and a striated appearance. They are characteristic of Langerhans cell histiocytosis .</p>\n<p></p>",

The c-kit gene codes for a receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed on the surface of mast cells . In systemic mastocytosis , there is a mutation in the c-kit gene that leads to the constitutive activation of the c-kit receptor , resulting in the abnormal proliferation and accumulation of mast cells in various tissues. Mutations in other genes, such as FGFR1, BCR-ABL, and JAK2, are associated with other myeloproliferative neoplasms but are not commonly associated with systemic mastocytosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Mutations associated with Myeloproliferative disorders: Disorder Mutation Chronic myeloid leukemia BCR-ABL fusion gene Polycythemia vera JAK2 mutations Essential thrombocythemia JAK2 mutations CALR mutations MPL mutations Primary myelofibrosis JAK2 mutations CALR mutations MPL mutations Systemic mastocytosis KIT mutations Chronic eosinophilic leukemia FIPILI-PDGFRA fusion gene PDE4DIP-PDGFRB fusion gene Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene mutationsb Various fusion genes involving FGFRI, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or JAK2</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A.
