B) 1 F(ab')\u2082 and a degraded Fc fragment</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><ul><li>\u2022 Explanation:</li><li>\u2022 When pepsin acts on an immunoglobulin molecule, it cleaves below the disulfide bonds in the hinge region of the heavy chains. This results in the formation of one F(ab')\u2082 fragment, which contains both antigen-binding sites connected by disulfide bonds, and a degraded Fc fragment composed of smaller peptides.</li><li>\u2022 Pepsin digestion differs from papain digestion, which cleaves above the disulfide bonds and produces two Fab fragments and one Fc fragment.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 1 Fc and 2 Fab fragments : Incorrect. This is the result of digestion with papain, not pepsin.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. 1 Fc and 2 Fab fragments</li><li>\u2022 Option C. 1 Variable chain and 1 constant chain : Incorrect. This is not the result of enzymatic cleavage by either papain or pepsin.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. 1 Variable chain and 1 constant chain</li><li>\u2022 Option D. 2 Fc and 2 Fab fragments : Incorrect.

The Lyon hypothesis (X-chromosome inactivation) actually explains why some heterozygous females can be affected by G6PD deficiency, though typically less severely than males. During early embryonic development, one X chromosome in each female cell is randomly inactivated. If a higher proportion of cells have the normal X chromosome inactivated, these females can express symptoms of G6PD deficiency. This variable inactivation creates a mosaic pattern in heterozygous females rather than contradicting the hypothesis.</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Other Options:</li><li>\u2022 Option A.

X-linked inheritance</li><li>\u2022 Option B. More severe in males - This is correct.
