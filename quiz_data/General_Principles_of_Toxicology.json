The formation of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) decreases the O2 carrying capacity of blood and impairs the release of O2 from Hb for its utilization in tissues. Through similar mechanisms, carbon monoxide decreases O2 storage in muscle cells by binding to and displacing O2 from, myoglobin.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A & D. Cyanide poisons the mitochondrial electron transport chain within cells and renders the body unable to derive energy (adenosine triphosphate\u2014ATP) from oxygen. Specifically, it binds to the a3 portion (complex IV) of cytochrome oxidase and prevents cells from using oxygen, causing rapid death. Option: C. Nitrites oxidize the iron component of red blood cells (hemoglobin), rendering them unable to carry oxygen. The resulting condition is called methemoglobinemia. Carbon monoxide CO has a 200 to 300 times higher affinity for Hb than O2, which forms COHb. Reduces O2 contain of blood and tissues. Produces Anaemic anoxia.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Boa\u2019s tube has a mark about 50 cm from the end of the tube which has lateral openings. The given case history is suggestive of an acute case of poisoning. The doctor asked for this instrument which is known as a Stomach tube/ Ewald\u2019s tube/ Boa\u2019s tube or an ordinary soft rubber tube with a glass funnel at one end that can be used. Gastric lavage is useful any time within 3 hours after ingestion of a poison. It is done using a stomach tube (Ewald's or Boa's, tube) or ordinary soft, non-collapsible rubber tube of one cm. diameter and one-and-half meter length, with a glass funnel attached at one end, and a mark about 50 cm. from the other end, which should be rounded with lateral openings to avoid any injury when it is being passed. At about the midpart of the tube, there is a suction bulb, used to pump out the stomach contents. A wooden mouth gag has a hole at its mid-part to allow the passage of the tube through it. The patient should be lying on his left side or prone with head hanging over the edge of the bed, and face down supported by an assistant so that the mouth is at a lower level than the larynx so that any fluid which may leak out through the sides of the tube will not trickle down inside the larynx and trachea. The end is lubricated with olive or sweet oil, liquid paraffin, or glycerine, and is passed into the stomach by depressing the tongue with two fingers or a tongue depressor, and slowly passing it downwards through the pharynx and esophagus into the stomach, till the 50 cm mark is reached. If there are no marks on the tube, the tube should be passed for a distance equal to that measured between the bridge of the nose and the tip of the xiphoid process. Force must not be used to insert the tube. The absence of coughing and breath sounds in the funnel will confirm that the tube has not entered into the trachea. Whenever in doubt, test by keeping the free end of the tube just below a water surface. Air from the stomach is usually expelled completely in 2 to 3 expirations, whereas air from the lungs causes bubbling at each expiration. About one-fourth liter of warm water (35'C) should be passed through the funnel held high up above the patient's head. When the funnel is empty, compress the tube below it between the finger and thumb and lower it below the level of the stomach, and its contents will be emptied by siphon action on releasing the pressure on the rubber tubing. Stomach contents can be aspirated by a 20 ml. syringe. Preserve this for chemical analysis. The only absolute contraindication is corrosive poisoning (except Carbolic acid), owing to the danger of perforation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For All Options:- Option A . Gastric lavage is useful any time within 3 hours after ingestion of a poison. It is done using a stomach tube Ewald's or Boa's, tube. Option B . Boa's, tube is a tube of one cm. diameter and one-and-half meter in length, with a glass funnel attached at one end, and a mark of about 50 cm. from the other end, which should be rounded with lateral openings to avoid any injury when it is being passed. Option C. Patient should be lying on his left side or prone with head hanging over the edge of the bed, and face down supported by an assistant, so that the mouth is at a lower level than the larynx, so that any fluid which may leak out through the sides of the tube will not trickle down inside the larynx and trachea.

The Act consolidates and amends the existing laws relating to narcotic drugs, strengthens the existing laws relating to narcotic drugs, and strengthens the existing controls over drugs of abuse. \"Psychotropic substance\", means any substance, natural or synthetic, or any natural material or any salt or preparation of such substance or material, included in the list of psychotropic substances specified in a Schedule to the Act. This schedule lists 77 psychotropic substances, e.g., LSD, and THE DRUGS AND COSMETIC RULES, 1945- They were framed under the Drugs Act, of 1940, to regulate the importation of drugs, the functions and procedures of the Central Drugs Laboratory, the appointment of licensing authorities, and the manufacture, distribution, and sale of drugs. These rules have classified drugs into Schedules as follows. Schedule C: Biological and special products; E: List of poisons; F: Vaccines and sera; G: Hormone preparations; H: Drugs (poisons to be sold only on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner); J: List of diseases for the cure of which no drug should be advertised; L: Antibiotics, antihistamines, and other recent chemotherapeutic agents. Both Schedule H and L drugs must not be sold by retail, except on a prescription by a registered medical practitioner THE PHARMACY ACT, 1948: It was passed in order to make better provision for the regulation of the profession of pharmacy and to constitute the Central Council of Pharmacy and State Councils of Pharmacy. The object of this Act is to allow only registered pharmacists to compound, prepare, mix, or dispense any medicine on the prescription of a medical practitioner. This does not apply to the dispensing by a doctor for his own patients. PREVENTION OF ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTIC DRUGS AND PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES ACT, 1988- If a person produces, possesses, transports, imports, exports, sells, purchases, or uses any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance except ganja, he shall be punishable with imprisonment.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Magenstrasse is the pathway of acids or alkalis which starts along the lesser curvature of the stomach. The information from the inquest report and from the relatives is obtained before starting the autopsy for diagnosing the case of poisoning. The findings of the autopsy are :- External findings show the surface of the body and the clothes may show stains or marks of vomit, feces, or the poison itself. The colour changes in the corroded skin and mucous membrane are: sulphuric and hydrochloric acid- grey, becoming black from blood; nitric acid- brown; hydrofluoric acid- reddish-brown; carbolic acid- greyish-white; oxalic acid- grey, blackened by blood; cresols- brown, leathery; caustic alkalis: greyish-white. The skin may be dark-brown or yellow in phosphorus and acute copper poisoning; cherry-red in poisoning by carbon monoxide; chacolate-coloured in cases of death from poisoning by nitrites, aniline, nitrobenzene, acetanilide, bromates, chlorates, etc. due to the formation of methaemoglobin. Smell about the mouth and nose may be garlic-like in Phosphorus, arsine gas, arsenic (breath and perspiration), thallium, tellurium, selenium, dimethylsulphoxide, parathion, malathion; sweet or fruity in Ethanol, chloroform, nitrites. Any evidence of marks of violence, such as bruises, or wounds of any nature, may suggest some form of death other than poison. The bodies of persons poisoned are not more rapidly decomposed than those of others. Some poisons may delay the action of the putrefactive bacteria to some extent. Internal findings show smell: On opening the body, note any peculiar smell. The skull should be opened first to detect unusual odours in the brain tissues because such odours are masked by the opening of the body cavities. This is useful in cyanide, alcohol, phenol, cresol, ether, chloroform, and camphor poisoning. Stomach shows toxic substances may be held in high concentrations in the rugae and crypts of the mucosa, or even in the blood in the actual stomach wall. The pathway of acids and alkalis in the food-filled stomach starts along the lesser curvature of the stomach and leads to the pylorus, which explains the location of the greatest damage in the food-filled stomach. Hyperaemia of the mucous membrane caused by an irritant poison is usually patchy and of a deep crimson colour. The ridges are more involved in poisoning than in disease. Oesophagus shows marked softening and desquamation of the mucous membrane by the corrosives. In acute cantharidin poisoning, the mucous membrane is often swollen and engorged and may show patches of ulceration. The ligatured stomach should never be sent for analysis without being opened, as putrefaction may obscure changes in the mucous membrane, and the gases produced may result in the lid of the jar being forced off in transit. The stomach is opened along its greater curvature in a clean porcelain dish. The wall is examined for fragments of poison adhered to it, such as powdered poisons, fragments of capsules, starch from tablets, fragments of leaves or fruit, cantharides, etc. The contents must be carefully observed and written notes made, regarding the volume, colour, and contents, including food.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For All Options:- Option: A.

In case of any poisoning, the doctor must work to maintain ABC(Airway, Breathing, Circulation) first and then provide any other symptomatic or specific treatment. The protocol for poisoning case management is as- Immediate resuscitation - by maintaining the ABC first and then working for CNS depression management. Removal of unabsorbed poison from the body - If the poison is inhaled as a gas, the patient must be removed into the fresh air, and artificial respiration and oxygen (six to eight liters per minute) should be given. If the poison has been injected subcutaneously from a bite or an injection, a tight ligature should be applied immediately above the wound, which must be loosened for one minute after every ten minutes, to prevent gangrene. The wound should be excised, the poison sucked out, and the poison neutralised by a suitable chemical substance. Gastric lavage is useful any time within 3 hours after ingestion of a poison. It is done using a stomach tube (Ewald's or Boa's, tube) or ordinary soft, non-collapsible rubber tube of one cm. diameter and one-and-half metre length, with a glass funnel attached at one end, and a mark about 50 cm. from the other end, which should be rounded with lateral openings to avoid any injury when it is being passed. At about the midpart of the tube, there is a suction bulb, used to pump out the stomach contents. A wooden mouth gag has a hole at its mid-part to allow the passage of the tube through it. Emetics should be used only if there is difficulty in obtaining or using a stomach tube. Vomiting can be produced only if the medullary centres are still responsive. It is contraindicated in case of ingestion of a CNS stimulant, because further stimulation associated with vomiting may produce convulsions. Administration of Antidotes - Mechanical antidote (activated charcoal, bulky food, Multidose activated charcoal facilitates the passage of substances from plasma into the intestinal lumen (by creating a concentration gradient between the blood and bowel fluid)); Chemical antidote(albumin, potassium permanganate, copper sulphate); Physiological antidote (E.D.T.A.(ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent and is effective in the lead, mercury, copper, cobalt, cadmium, iron, and nickel poisoning), BAL, and DMSA).
