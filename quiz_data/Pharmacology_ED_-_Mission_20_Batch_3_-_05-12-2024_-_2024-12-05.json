In normal circumstances, adrenaline produces biphasic response; first increase in BP (due to stimulation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors) and then decrease in BP (due to unopposed beta-2 stimulation). However, when alpha receptors are blocked, the administration of adrenaline leads to a predominant action on the beta receptors, causing vasodilation and an decrease in blood pressure.</li><li>\u2022 Vasomotor reversal of Dale</li><li>\u2022 c.

While ritonavir does inhibit the HIV protease enzyme, it's not primarily used for that purpose in most modern HAART regimens. Instead, it's given in low doses to boost the effect of other protease inhibitors by inhibiting CYP3A4. The dose of ritonavir used for boosting is lower than that required to inhibit the HIV protease.</li><li>\u2022 (B) This statement is incorrect. Ritonavir's function as a booster in combination with another protease inhibitor is not typically associated with an increased resistance. On the contrary, its role is to enhance the effectiveness of the primary protease inhibitor.</li><li>\u2022 (C) True. Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4, an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of many drugs, including other protease inhibitors. By doing this, ritonavir can increase the plasma levels of these drugs, thus maximizing their effectiveness against the HIV virus.</li><li>\u2022 (D) This is not accurate. While ritonavir does have activity against HIV as a protease inhibitor, its primary use in current HAART regimens is as a booster to enhance the levels of other protease inhibitors.

The disease is characterized by a deficiency in dopamine, leading to an imbalance favouring cholinergic activity. Drugs that block D2 receptors can exacerbate this dopamine deficiency, worsening parkinsonian symptoms. Conversely, blocking muscarinic (M1) receptors can help reduce cholinergic overactivity, potentially improving symptoms. Therefore, drugs that strongly block D2 receptors, such as Drug D, are more likely to worsen Parkinsonism.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",
