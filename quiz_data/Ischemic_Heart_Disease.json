      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Subendocardium Irreversible injury of ischemic myocytes first occurs in the subendocardial zone . This region is especially susceptible to ischemia because: It is the last area to receive blood delivered by the epicardial vessels . Because it is exposed to relatively high intramural pressures , which act to impede the inflow of blood . Endocardium is perfused by being directly in contact with blood present in the ventricles , making the subendocardium more susceptible than the endocardium.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Transmural infarct: Involves the entire thickness of the wall , and occurs due to complete occlusion of the epicardial vessel . These are usually associated with chronic coronary atherosclerosis, acute plaque change, and superimposed thrombosis . Subendocardial infarct: Involves portion just beneath the endocardium , occurs due to partial occlusion of the epicardial vessel, hypotension/shock . In the subendocardial infarcts that occur due to global hypotension, myocardial damage is often circumferential , rather than being limited to the distribution of a single major coronary artery. Multifocal microinfarct: Involves smaller intramural vessels , and occurs due to microemboli, vasculitis, vasospasm , increase in endogenous catecholamines ( epinephrine ) or drugs ( cocaine ). Elevated levels of catecholamines also increase heart rate and myocardial contractility, exacerbating ischemia caused by the vasospasm, the outcome of such vasospasm can be sudden cardiac death.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

The diagnosis of myocardial injury is established when blood levels of troponin are elevated above threshold levels. Cardiac troponins begin to rise in 2-4 hours and peak at 24-48 hours after an acute infarct. Troponins are an indicator of myocyte death and thus can be elevated even in Myocarditis and myocardial trauma . Troponins can also leak in other conditions such as Congestive heart failure, Pulmonary embolism, Renal failure, and sepsis . Serial measurements are thus helpful to differentiate such conditions from Myocardial Infarction (MI) as a serial rise in troponins is seen with MI .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Options B , C and D are incorrect</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>CK-MB, Troponin T, LDH 1 are all elevated in MI but the best biomarkers for MI are serial measurements of Troponin T and I.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Cardiac markers to rise after IHD: \u00b7 1-2 hrs: Myoglobin \u00b7 2-4 hrs: CK \u00b7 4-8 hrs: Troponin (persists up to 14 days) 6-12 hrs: CK-MB (persists up to 48 hrs</p>\n<p></p>",

Hypertrophy of the heart is an adaptive response to the pressure overload of chronic hypertension. The minimal pathologic criteria for the diagnosis of systemic HHD are the following: Left ventricular hypertrophy (usually concentric) in the absence of other cardiovascular pathology A clinical history or pathologic evidence of hypertension in other organs (e.g., kidney). Hypertension induces left ventricular pressure overload hypertrophy , initially without ventricular dilation . As a result, the left ventricular wall thickening increases the weight of the heart disproportionately to the increase in overall cardiac size . Over time, the increased thickness of the left ventricular wall, associated with increased interstitial connective tissue , imparts a stiffness that impairs diastolic filling , often leading to left atrial enlargement . Hypertensive heart disease, systemic and pulmonary. (A) Systemic (left-sided) hypertensive heart disease. There is marked concentric thickening of the left ventricular wall causing reduction in lumen size. The left ventricle and left atrium (asterisk) are on the right in this apical four-chamber view of the heart. A pacemaker is present in the right ventricle (arrow). (B) Pulmonary (right-sided) hypertensive heart disease (cor pulmonale). The right ventricle is markedly dilated and has a thickened free wall and hypertrophied trabeculae (apical four-chamber view of heart, right ventricle on left). The shape of the left ventricle (to the right) has been distorted by the enlarged right ventricle. Microscopically, the earliest change of systemic Hypertensive Heart Disease (HHD) is an increase in the transverse diameter of myocytes , which may be difficult to appreciate on routine microscopy. At a more advanced stage , variable degrees of cellular and nuclear enlargement become apparent , often accompanied by perivascular and interstitial fibrosis . Effective control of hypertension can prevent cardiac hypertrophy and can even lead to its regression ; with normalization of blood pressure, the associated risks of HHD are diminished .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.
