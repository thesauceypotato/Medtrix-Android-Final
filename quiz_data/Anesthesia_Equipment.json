The major advantage of I -gel is that the cuff is prefilled with gel, avoiding complications related to the cuff like accidental deflation, and damage to the cuff by patient bite. Due to proprietary rights, it is a type of laryngeal mask airway however called a laryngeal It has a port for gastric deflation. As it is a type of second- generation laryngeal mask, the risk of aspiration is less as compared to first-generation LMA.</p>\n<p></p>",
