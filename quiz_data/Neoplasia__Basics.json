      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Heterotopic (ectopic) rest of cells Choristoma is the term applied to a heterotopic (misplaced) rest of cells . For example, a small nodule of well-developed and normally organized pancreatic tissue may be found in the submucosa of the stomach, duodenum, or small intestine.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Choristoma: Normal tissue at abnormal site, eg: Normal Gastric mucosa in pancreatic biopsy . Hamartoma: Abnormal tissue at normal site, eg: Dysplastic lung tissue in lump .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Example of hamartoma. Incorrect , hamartoma is abnormal tissue at normal site . Option: C. Benign tumor of trophoblastic cell. Incorrect , Hydatidiform mole or molar pregnancy is benign tumor of trophoblastic cell . Option: D. Benign tumor of cartilaginous tissue. Incorrect , Chondroma is benign tumor of cartilaginous tissue .</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Anaplasia</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Differentiation refers to the extent to which neoplastic parenchymal cells resemble the corresponding normal parenchymal cells , both morphologically and functionally; lack of differentiation is called anaplasia . In general, benign tumors are well differentiated .</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: B. Metaplasia is defined as the replacement of one type of cell with another type . Metaplasia is nearly always found in association with tissue damage, repair, and regeneration . Option: C. Dysplasia is a term that literally means \u201c disordered growth .\u201d Dysplastic epithelial surfaces also typically show architectural disarray and a loss of orderly differentiation . Option: D. Carcinoma in situ. When dysplasia is severe and involves the full thickness of the epithelium but the lesion does not penetrate the basement membrane , it is referred to as carcinoma in situ .</p>\n<p></p>",
