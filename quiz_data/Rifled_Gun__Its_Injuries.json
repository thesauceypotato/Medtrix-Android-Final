Sometimes, after passing through the brain, there is not enough energy left in the bullet to penetrate the skull. It may rebound (ricochet) from the inner table of the skull, producing a second track. If it ricochets for a second time, a third wound track is produced.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect options:- Option: A .Tumbling bullet is a type of bullet that rotate end to end during its motion. Option: B . Balling or welding of the shots- it results in conversion of the shotgun pellets into a compact mass, which can travel for a few metres in this form. In such cases, a circular or oval entrance wound of about 5 to 10 mm is observed. In diameter, and widespread, small, circular punctures are seen, suggesting the use of two different weapons, one a shotgun at distant range and the other a rifle. This can be due to faulty manufacture or old ammunition. Option: D . Souvenir bullet - it is the formation of a fibrotic capsule around the very old retained bullet in the body.</p>\n<p></p>",
