      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Refractive correction Accommodative esotropia, or refractive esotropia, is one of the most common forms of esotropia (crossed eye), which is a type of strabismus, or eye misalignment. It refers to eye crossing that is caused by the focusing efforts of the eyes as they try to see clearly. Patients with refractive esotropia are typically farsighted (hyperopic). This means that the eyes must work harder to see clearly, particularly when the object of regard is up close. Initial treatment for accommodative esotropia usually involves the prescription of eyeglasses or contact lenses to correct the patient\u2019s refractive error (hyperopia). By letting the eyeglasses do the work, the eyes can relax their focusing or accommodative effort. In turn, this will reduce the convergence or crossing stimulus and the eyes will straighten as they relax. Glasses or contacts which are used to treat accommodative esotropia should be worn full time</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Visual acuity and refraction under atropine ointment The first test to be done in a patient of squint is checking for visual acuity and refraction under full cycloplegia. The cycloplegic of choice in less than 8 years is atropine ointment. The complaint of making too many mistakes points towards the blurred vision for far. Thus the foremost step is checking for refraction under cycloplegic cover. For the management of squint patients, the first & foremost step is to modestly check for refractive error with cycloplegia & correcting the same. Statement A - Correcting the refractive error corrects the squint in most of the patients. Statement B - Then the patient is trained with orthoptic exercises to strengthen the fusional reserves so that bifoveal single vision can be maintained without much effort. Statement C - Prisms are used to permanently correct the heterophoria. Prisms are better suited for vertical squints than horizontal ones. Statement D - Surgeries are the last resort when all other modalities fail. Surgery is decided according to the muscle concerned.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Orthoptic exercise - not corrective in this case. Option: B. Surgery- tried in refractory cases only. Option: C. Relieving prism - not preferred.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Lateral rectus and abducens nerve The lateral rectus muscle is a muscle on the lateral side of the eyeball in orbit. It is one of six extraocular muscles that control the movements of the eye. The lateral rectus muscle is responsible for the lateral movement of the eyeball, specifically abduction. Abduction describes the movement of the eye away from the midline (i.e. nose), allowing the eyeball to move horizontally in the lateral direction, bringing the pupil away from the midline of the body It is the only muscle supplied by the abducens nerve, cranial nerve VI. The abducens nerve exits the brainstem from the pons-medullary junction and travels through the superior orbital fissure to innervate the lateral rectus muscle. The lateral rectus muscle is innervated through the tectospinal tract</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The extraocular muscles are innervated by three cranial nerves. Damage to one of the cranial nerves will cause paralysis of its respective muscles. This will alter the resting gaze of the affected eye. Thus, a lesion of each cranial nerve has its own characteristic appearance: The oculomotor nerve (CN III) \u2013 A lesion of the oculomotor nerve affects most of the extraocular muscles. The affected eye is displaced laterally by the lateral rectus and inferiorly by the superior oblique. The eye adopts a position known as \u2018down and out\u2019. Trochlear nerve (CN IV) \u2013 A lesion of CN IV will paralyse the superior oblique muscle. There is no obvious effect of the resting orientation of the eyeball. However, the patient will complain of diplopia (double vision) and may develop a head tilt away from the site of the lesion. Abducens nerve (CN VI) \u2013 A lesion of CN VI will paralyse the lateral rectus muscle. The affected eye will be adducted by the resting tone of the medial rectus</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>6th nerve palsy Transposition refers to the relocation of one or more extraocular muscles to substitute for the action of an absent or severely deficient muscle. The most common indication is severe lateral rectus weakness due to acquired palsy of the 6th cranial nerve palsy. Isolated muscle paralysis Lateral rectus and superior oblique are the most common muscles to be paralysed singly, as they have separate nerve supplies . Isolated paralysis of the remaining four muscles is less common, except in congenital lesions. In paralysis of the right lateral rectus muscle there occurs : Overaction of the left medial rectus, Contracture of the right medial rectus and Inhibitional palsy of the left lateral rectus muscle.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. 3rd Nerve Palsy: isolated palsy of the oculomotor nerve is less common. Option: B. 4th nerve palsy: less common than 6th nerve palsy. Option: C. 5th nerve palsy: causes Neuropathic keratitis.</p>\n<p></p>",
