Thus, the entire plasma volume (about 3 liters) is filtered 60 times daily. A substance is present in a concentration of 2 mg% in the afferent arteriole and 0 mg% in the efferent.

On history taking, the patient says it was just nausea, vomiting, and fever in the beginning. Later, she started having ulcers in the mouth and a rash that turned into blisters. The doctor suspected it was a contagious viral infection. The strange thing, in this case, is that the boy who is her brother, despite coming in contact with his sister multiple times, was not infected.
