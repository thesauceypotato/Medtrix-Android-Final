This condition is known as hypercalcemia of malignancy. Hypercalcemia of malignancy refers to high levels of calcium in the blood due to cancer. It's a relatively common complication among individuals diagnosed with various types of cancer. This condition occurs when cancer cells produce substances that mimic the action of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or directly release calcium into the bloodstream. Mechanisms: Local Osteolytic Hypercalcemia: Some cancers (like multiple myeloma or metastatic bone tumors) can invade bone tissue, leading to increased bone breakdown (osteolysis). This process releases calcium into the blood. Humoral Hypercalcemia : Cancer cells can produce substances (parathyroid hormone-related protein or PTHrP) that mimic PTH. These substances act on the same receptors as PTH, stimulating the release of calcium from bones and reducing kidney excretion, leading to elevated blood calcium levels. Other Mechanisms : Some tumors might directly produce calcitriol (active vitamin D), which increases intestinal absorption of calcium. Symptoms: Mild Cases: Often asymptomatic or with subtle symptoms. Moderate to Severe: Symptoms might include excessive thirst, frequent urination, constipation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion, weakness, and in severe cases, cardiac arrhythmias. Diagnosis and Treatment: Lab Tests: Blood tests reveal high calcium levels (usually above 10.4 mg/dL). Underlying Cancer: Identifying the primary malignancy is crucial for appropriate management. Treatment: Addressing the underlying cancer is primary. Additionally, treatments for hypercalcemia include intravenous fluids, medications (such as bisphosphonates or calcitonin) to lower calcium levels, and sometimes corticosteroids.</p>\n<p></p>",

The presence of Anti-HBc total (indicating past exposure to HBV) along with absence of HBsAg and Anti-HBs suggests a resolved HBV infection. The individual has developed antibodies (Anti-HBc) in response to a past HBV infection, implying recovery and immunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg): Presence indicates an active infection. If HBsAg persists for more than six months, it suggests chronic hepatitis B. Normal value: Negative Hepatitis B Surface Antibody (anti-HBs): Presence indicates immunity either from past infection or vaccination. Normal value: Positive in vaccinated individuals or after recovery from acute infection. Hepatitis B Core Antibody (anti-HBc): Indicates a previous or ongoing infection. The presence of anti-HBc IgM suggests an acute infection. Normal value: Positive in individuals who have been infected with HBV. Hepatitis B e Antigen (HBeAg): Its presence indicates active viral replication and high infectivity. Normal value: Positive during active viral replication. Hepatitis B e Antibody (anti-HBe): Its presence indicates a lower level of viral replication and reduced infectivity. Normal value: Positive after the resolution of active viral replication. HBV DNA Quantification: Measures the amount of HBV genetic material (viral load) in the blood. Helps determine the level of viral replication and monitor treatment response. Normal value: Undetectable or very low in healthy individuals.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A- Acute HBV Infection in Window Period: The window period refers to the time between initial HBV infection and the appearance of detectable markers like HBsAg or antibodies. In this scenario, Anti-HBc IgM, an early marker of acute infection, is not mentioned as positive. Therefore, solely based on the provided information, diagnosing acute HBV infection in the window period might be premature. Option: B - Presence of Anti-HBs alone doesn\u2019t necessarily confirm vaccination status. The absence of HBsAg, presence of Anti-HBc total, and lack of other specific markers for acute infection or active viral replication do not support a conclusion of recent vaccination. Option: D - Chronic HBV Infection \u2013 Inactive Carrier: This typically involves the presence of HBsAg for an extended period without evidence of active viral replication (HBeAg negative, low or undetectable HBV DNA). In this case, Anti-HBc total being positive and absence of HBsAg or Anti-HBe doesn\u2019t align with the typical profile of an inactive carrier.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Hepatitis serologic markers Anti-HAV (IgM) IgM antibody to HAV; best test to detect acute hepatitis A. Anti-HAV (IgG) IgG antibody indicates prior HAV infection and/or prior vaccination; protects against reinfection. HBsAg Antigen found on surface of HBV; indicates hepatitis B infection.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Acromegaly The given image shows, frontal bossing, prognathous jaw. Acromegaly is characterized by the excessive production of growth hormone (GH), usually due to a pituitary tumor. This excess GH leads to abnormal growth of bones and tissues. Key features include enlarged hands and feet, facial changes (prognathism, enlarged nose, lips, and ears), and in some cases, frontal bossing. Hence the diagnosis is Acromegaly.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Acromegaly is a rare hormonal disorder caused by excessive production of growth hormone (GH) by the pituitary gland, usually due to a benign tumor called a pituitary adenoma. Etiology: The majority of acromegaly cases are caused by a benign tumor in the pituitary gland. This tumor produces excess growth hormone, leading to an abnormal increase in the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in the liver and other tissues. Clinical Features: Gradual Onset: Acromegaly often develops slowly, and its diagnosis might be delayed for several years. Physical Changes: Characteristic features include enlargement of the hands, feet, and facial bones. Patients may notice changes in their facial features, such as a protruding jaw, enlarged nose, thickened lips, and an increase in the size of hands and feet. Systemic Effects: Acromegaly can also affect other systems, leading to cardiovascular complications, joint pain, sleep apnea, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Diagnosis: Hormonal Assessment: Blood tests to measure GH and IGF-1 levels help in diagnosing acromegaly. Imaging: Imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scans, of the pituitary gland are used to locate pituitary tumors. Treatment: Surgery: Surgical removal of the pituitary tumor (transsphenoidal surgery) is often the first-line treatment if the tumor is accessible. Medications: Somatostatin analogs (such as octreotide and lanreotide) or growth hormone receptor antagonists (pegvisomant) may be used to reduce GH levels. Radiation Therapy: In cases where surgery and medications are not effective, radiation therapy may be considered. Long-Term Management: Regular Monitoring: Patients need ongoing monitoring of GH and IGF-1 levels to ensure that treatment is effective.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A - Addison's Disease: This condition involves the adrenal glands not producing enough hormones, particularly cortisol and sometimes aldosterone. Symptoms may include fatigue, weight loss, low blood pressure, and hyperpigmentation (especially in skin creases). It doesn't typically present with frontal bossing or a prognathous jaw. Option: C - Gigantism also results from excess GH production, usually occurring before the closure of the growth plates in long bones during adolescence. It leads to excessive growth in height, often resulting in an abnormally tall stature. However, the key differentiation from acromegaly lies in the timing of onset and the resulting manifestations, which are more related to overall body growth and not just facial changes. Option: D- Cushing's Syndrome: This condition involves excessive cortisol levels, often caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol. Symptoms may include weight gain (especially in the face and abdomen), round face (moon face), thinning skin, and muscle weakness.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Megaloblastic anaemia Vegetarianism, pallor, fatigue, increased red cell volume are features of megaloblastic anaemia caused by deficiency of vitamin B12. The presentation of fatigue, weakness, pallor, and an increased MCV of 110 fL strongly suggests a megaloblastic anemia. This type of anemia is often caused by deficiencies in vitamin B12 or folate, leading to impaired DNA synthesis in red blood cell production, resulting in larger, immature red blood cells (macrocytes).</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Megaloblastic anemia is a type of anemia characterized by the presence of large, immature red blood cells known as megaloblasts in the bone marrow. These cells are unable to divide normally, leading to ineffective production of red blood cells (erythropoiesis) and resulting in anemia. Causes: Vitamin Deficiencies: The most common causes are deficiencies in vitamin B12 (cobalamin) or folic acid (folate). These vitamins play crucial roles in DNA synthesis and red blood cell production. Deficiencies can occur due to inadequate intake, malabsorption (e.g., pernicious anemia affecting B12 absorption), or certain medical conditions affecting their absorption or utilization. Other Causes: Rarely, certain medications, inherited disorders affecting DNA synthesis, or conditions interfering with DNA synthesis, such as myelodysplastic syndromes, can lead to megaloblastic changes. Clinical Features: Anemia Symptoms: Patients often present with symptoms of anemia, including fatigue, weakness, pallor, and shortness of breath. Neurological Manifestations: Severe vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms (subacute combined degeneration) such as tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, gait disturbances, and cognitive changes. Diagnostic Evaluation: Complete Blood Count (CBC): Blood tests reveal a low red blood cell count, enlarged red blood cells (macrocytosis), and anemia. Peripheral Blood Smear: Macrocytic red blood cells and megaloblastic changes. Serum Levels: Measurement of vitamin B12 and folate levels helps identify deficiencies.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A - The increased MCV (mean corpuscular volume) of 110 fL in this case is more indicative of macrocytic (larger than normal) red blood cells, which is not consistent with iron deficiency anemia. Option: C- Aplastic anemia involves a reduction in all blood cell types due to damage to the bone marrow, resulting in pancytopenia (reduction in red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). While it can lead to anemia and weakness, the characteristic findings of macrocytosis (increased MCV) seen in this case do not align with aplastic anemia. Option: D - Thalassemia is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production, leading to anemia. However, the increased MCV of 110 fL is not consistent with thalassemia. Thalassemia typically presents with microcytic and hypochromic red blood cells.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Classification of anemia RBC morphology</p>\n<p></p>",

Hence, it is also called as PAP smear.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Pap Smear (Exfoliative Cytology) Time for initiating pap smear: 21 years of age regardless of the age of first sexual intercourse. The instrument used: Ayres spatula and endocervical brush Method: Ayres spatula is rotated 360\u00b0 over a portion vaginalis of the cervix and 1st slide is prepared With cytobrush, 2nd slide is prepared from the endocervix Control slide prepared from posterior wall/posterior fornix of vagina Fixative used: 95% ethyl alcohol and ether.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Revised Guideline for Pap Smear: Cervical Cancer Screening Age to begin pap smear = 21 years Women aged 21-29 years should have a pap test every 3 years (earlier it was done annually) Women aged 30-65 years should have a pap test and HPV testing every 5 years. It is acceptable to have a pap test alone every 3 years. Women should stop having cervical cancer screening after the age of 65 years if they do not have a H/O moderate or severe dysplasia or cancer and they have had either three negative pap test results in a row or two negative co-test results in a row within 10 years, with the most recent test performed within the past 5 years. Women, who have a history of cervical cancer, are infected with HIV, or have been exposed to DES should have annual screening done. In HIV-positive females, if three consecutive tests are normal, they can have testing once in every 3 years instead of annually. Abnormal results are reported according to the Bethesda System . They include: In the Bethesda system: The most common cytological abnormality encountered is atypical squamous cells (ASC) . The category ASC is further divided into ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of unknown significance), and ASC-H (atypical squamous cells where HSIL cannot be ruled out) Squamous cell abnormalities (SIL) Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL or LSIL) Atypical squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL or HSIL) Squamous cell carcinoma Glandular epithelial cell abnormalities\u2013 Endocervical and endometrial abnormalities can also be detected by pap smear A number of infectious processes, including yeast, candidiasis, herpes simplex virus, and trichomoniasis can also be detected however, it is not very sensitive at detecting these infections</p>\n<p></p>",
