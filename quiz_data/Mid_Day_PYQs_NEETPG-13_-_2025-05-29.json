The sodium content in ReSoMal is 45 mmol/L, not 65 mmol/L as stated in option C. This reduced sodium concentration is intentional because malnourished children have excess body sodium despite presenting with low serum sodium levels.

Copper 0.045 mmol/L - Correct</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Potassium 40 mmol/L - Correct . ReSoMal has increased potassium (40 mmol/L) compared to standard ORS (20 mmol/L) to address potassium depletion in malnourished children.</li><li>\u2022 Option B. Potassium 40 mmol/L - Correct</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Magnesium 3 mmol/L - Correct .
