In the supine position during late pregnancy, the gravid uterus compresses the IVC, which can decrease venous return to the heart. This condition, known as supine hypotensive syndrome, leads to reduced cardiac output and can cause symptoms such as dizziness, light-headedness, and a decreased supply of oxygen and nutrients to vital organs.</li><li>\u2022 Supine Hypotensive Syndrome: This occurs when the enlarged uterus compresses the IVC, reducing venous return to the heart, leading to symptoms like dizziness and light-headedness.

Glycogen synthase catalyzes the addition of glucose molecules to the growing glycogen chain by creating alpha-1,4-glycosidic linkages between glucose units. This enzyme is regulated by various factors, including insulin, which promotes glycogen synthesis by activating glycogen synthase.</li><li>\u27a4 Mutations or dysregulation of glycogen synthase can lead to Glycogen Storage Disease 0 (GSD 0), a disorder resulting from mutations in the GYS2 gene encoding liver glycogen synthase.
