      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Subarachnoid Hemorrhage What is SAH? Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a type of extra-axial intracranial haemorrhage and denotes the presence of blood within the subarachnoid space Symptoms Patients typically present with a thunderclap headache, described as a sudden-onset headache that is the worst headache of their life. It is often associated with photophobia and meningism. Focal neurological deficits often present either at the same time as a headache or soon thereafter In a substantial number of patients, it is associated with collapse and decreased or loss of consciousness, even in those patients who subsequently regain consciousness and have a good grade.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Radiography CT The sensitivity of CT to the presence of subarachnoid blood is strongly influenced by both the amount of blood and the time since the haemorrhage. The diagnosis is suspected when a hyperdense material is seen filling the subarachnoid space. Most commonly this is apparent around the circle of Willis, on account of the majority of berry aneurysms occurring in this region , or in the Sylvian fissure Small amounts of blood can sometimes be appreciated pooling in the interpeduncular fossa, appearing as a small hyperdense triangle, or within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles 5. Subarachnoid haemorrhage are grouped into four categories according to the amount of blood on unenhanced CT by the Fisher scale. This scale has been updated to the modified Fisher scale, which more accurately correlates the risk of vasospasm. MRI MRI is sensitive to subarachnoid blood and is able to visualize it well in the first 12 hours typically as a hyperintensity in the subarachnoid space on FLAIR Susceptibility weighted sequences are also exquisitely sensitive to blood products. MR angiography and MR venography are also able to detect a causative aneurysm or another source of bleeding, although in general MRI suffers from poor availability (compared to CT), longer scan times and greater difficulty in transferring and looking after patients who are often unstable and intubated. In aneurysm-associated subarachnoid haemorrhage, diffusion weighted imaging may demonstrate early ischaemic changes (within 0-3 days) in more than half of all patients 8. Additional delayed ischemia detectable with DWI, associated with vasospasm developing 4-21 days after ictus, may develop in about half of all patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B. Meningitis ; Meningitis is the inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by infection. It can be fatal and requires immediate medical care. Meningitis can be caused by several species of bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites Option C. Hemorrhagic stroke ;Hemorrhagic stroke is due to bleeding into the brain by the rupture of a blood vessel. Hemorrhagic stroke may be further subdivided into intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Hemorrhagic stroke is associated with severe morbidity and high mortality. Option D. SDH ; Subdural hemorrhage (SDH) (also commonly called a subdural hematoma) is a collection of blood accumulating in the subdural space, the potential space between the dura and arachnoid mater of the meninges around the brain.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Intracranial saccular aneurysms (\u201cberry aneurysms\u201d) represent the most common etiology of nontraumatic SAH; about 80% of cases of SAH result from ruptured aneurysms</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",

Achalasia can usually be managed with minimally invasive (endoscopic) therapy or surgery. Option C.

It is a serious sequela to many different disease processes and underlying etiologies. Its recognition and management should be prompt Option D.

To help guide clinical decision making, this system also incorporates information on cell type (ESCC, EAC, etc.), grade (degree of differentiation \u2013 an indication of the biological aggressiveness of the cancer cells), and tumor location (upper, middle, lower, or junctional</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
