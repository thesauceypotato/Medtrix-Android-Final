This condition is seen in atrophic rhinitis . Roomy nasal cavity is seen in Atrophic Rhinitis.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>In atrophic rhinitis, the turbinates, venous sinusoids, seromucinous glands and nerves undergo atrophy, resulting in a foul smelling discharge. Atrophic rhinitis is a chronic nasal condition with unknown cause. It is characterised by the formation of thick dry crusts in a roomy nasal cavity, which has resulted from progressive wasting away or decrease in size (atrophy) of the mucous nasal lining (mucosa) and underlying bone. The various symptoms include foetor (strong offensive smell), crusting/nasal obstruction, nosebleeds, paradoxical so called merciful anosmia (loss of smell) or cacosmia (hallucination of disagreeable odour), secondary infection, maggot infestation, nasal deformity, pharyngitis, otitis media and even, rarely, extension into the brain and its membranes.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- OPTION B- nasal polyps are non neoplastic masses of edematous nasal/sinus mucosa. they can be antrochoanal or ethmoidal polyps. OPTION C- inferior turbinate hypertrophy is associated with allergic rhinitis, infectious rhinitis and vasomotor rhinitis. OPTION D- Foreign body in nose is commonly seen in children and presents with unilateral foul smelling nasal discharge.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Atrophic rhinosinusitis may be categorized into two forms: primary (or idiopathic) and secondary. The primary form is seen primarily in young people in the developing world. It is associated with mucosal colonization, predominantly with Klebsiella ozaenae, as well as other organisms. The primary presenting symptom is foul-smelling nasal discharge. Secondary atrophic rhinosinusitis is seen with some regularity in the developed world and occurs in patients who underwent prior sinonasal trauma, surgery, radiation therapy, or have certain inflammatory conditions (granulomatous diseases).</p>\n<p></p>",

The external carotid artery supplies the nose via the facial and internal maxillary branches. The superior labial branch of the facial artery supplies the anterior nasal floor and nasal septum. The internal maxillary artery divides into multiple branches in the pterygomaxillary fossa. The most important nasal branch, the sphenopalatine artery, supplies the turbinates and meati laterally, and the posterior and inferior septum medially. The internal carotid artery provides blood supply to the nose via the ophthalmic artery, which passes through the superior orbital fissure and divides into several branches, with the most prominent being the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries. Both give off branches to the lateral and septal walls.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Showing the elevation of mucoperiosteal flap, identifying the ethmoidal crest, Sphenopalatine foramen</p>\n<p></p>",

It mostly manifests after extubation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) innervates all of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx with the exception of the cricothyroid muscle, which is innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN). Mechanisms of injury to the RLN include complete or partial transection, traction, contusion, crush, burn, misplaced ligature, and compromised blood supply. The consequence of an RLN injury is true vocal-fold paresis or paralysis. Patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis present with postoperative hoarseness or breathiness. The presentation is often subacute. At first, the vocal fold usually remains in the paramedian position, creating a fairly normal voice. Definite vocal changes may not manifest for days to weeks. The paralyzed vocal fold atrophies, causing the voice to worsen. Other potential sequelae of unilateral vocal-fold paralysis are dysphagia and aspiration. Bilateral vocal-fold paralysis may occur after total thyroidectomy, and it usually manifests immediately after extubation. Both vocal folds remain in the paramedian position, causing partial airway obstruction. Patients with bilateral vocal-fold paralysis may present with biphasic stridor, respiratory distress, or both. On occasion, the airway is sufficient in the immediate postoperative period despite the paralyzed vocal folds. At follow-up, such patients may present with dyspnea or stridor with exertion. The external branch of the SLN is probably the nerve most commonly injured in thyroid surgery. The rate of injury to the external branch of the SLN is estimated at 0-25%. This rate is probably underestimated, because the diagnosis is frequently missed. The clinical presentation of a patient with SLN paralysis may be subtle. Most patients do not notice any change. On occasion, a patient presents with mild hoarseness or decreased vocal stamina.</p>\n<p></p>",

Reactive bleeding \u2013 occurs within 24 hours of operation. Most cases of reactive haemorrhage are from a ligature that slips or a missed vessel. These vessels are often missed intraoperatively due to intraoperative hypotension and vasoconstriction, meaning only once the blood pressure normalises post-operatively will this bleeding occur. Secondary bleeding \u2013 occurs 7-10 days post-operatively. Secondary haemorrhage is often due to erosion of a vessel from a spreading infection. Secondary haemorrhage is most often seen when a heavily contaminated wound is closed primarily.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Classification of Haemorrhagic Shock Class I Class II Class III Class IV Blood Loss (ml) <750ml 750-1500ml 1500-2000 >2000 Blood Loss (%) <15% 15-30% 30-40% >40% Heart Rate <100 100-120 120-140 >140 Blood Pressure Normal Normal Decreased Decreased Respiratory Rate 14-20 20-30 30-40 >40 Urine Output (mL/hr) >30 20-30 5-20 <5</p>\n<p></p>",
