      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Hepatitis B Hepatitis B is not a polysaccharide vaccine. It is a recombinant protein vaccine. Polysaccharide vaccines include: Pneumococcal Meningococcal Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib, although there is also a conjugate version) Hepatitis B vaccine is made using recombinant DNA technology to produce the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in yeast cells</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Polysaccharide Vaccines : These vaccines use polysaccharides (sugar molecules) from the surface of bacteria to stimulate an immune response. They are typically less effective in young children because they do not provoke a strong immune memory response. Conjugate Vaccines : Many polysaccharide vaccines have been replaced or supplemented by conjugate vaccines, which link the polysaccharide to a protein carrier. This linkage enhances the immune response, especially in infants and young children, by providing a stronger and longer-lasting immunity. These vaccines are crucial in preventing serious bacterial infections and are recommended for specific populations, including the elderly, individuals with certain medical conditions, travelers, and sometimes children.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Vaccine Target Pathogen Indication/Use Notes Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (PPSV23) Streptococcus pneumoniae Prevention of pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia and meningitis, especially in adults over 65 and at-risk individuals Protects against 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria; primarily used in adults and certain high-risk populations. Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (MPSV4) Neisseria meningitidis Prevention of meningococcal disease Protects against 4 serogroups (A, C, Y, W-135); primarily used in older adults and travelers to high-risk areas. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) Polysaccharide Vaccine Haemophilus influenzae type b Prevention of invasive Hib disease (e.g., meningitis, pneumonia) in children Replaced by conjugate vaccines due to better immune response in infants. Typhoid Polysaccharide Vaccine Salmonella Typhi Prevention of typhoid fever Used for travelers to areas where typhoid fever is endemic. Vi Capsular Polysaccharide Vaccine Salmonella Typhi Prevention of typhoid fever An injectable vaccine, provides immunity for 2-3 years.</p>\n<p></p>",

Weight for height < 1.77 : This value should typically be interpreted as z-scores, and if it is significantly low, it could indicate wasting, which is a sign of acute malnutrition.

This strain can emerge in populations with low immunity where the oral polio vaccine (OPV), which contains weakened (attenuated) live virus, is used. In rare cases, the attenuated virus in the OPV can genetically revert to a form that can cause paralysis and spread among under-immunized populations, causing outbreaks of vaccine-derived poliovirus. In 2016, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) globally synchronized the withdrawal of the type-2 component of the OPV (tOPV) from immunization programs due to the risk of VDPV2 outbreaks. Since then, outbreaks due to type-2 VDPV have become the predominant concern, while type-1 and type-3 VDPVs have occurred much less frequently. Therefore, option A (Type-2 virus) is the correct answer regarding the primary cause of vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>VDPV stands for Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus . It is a strain of the poliovirus that has genetically mutated from the weakened virus contained in the oral polio vaccine (OPV). VDPV can circulate in communities with low vaccine coverage, spreading from person to person through the fecal-oral route. Increased risk in areas with low vaccination rates and poor sanitation, where the virus can replicate and mutate over time. VDPV outbreaks can occur in areas with low immunity to poliovirus , leading to cases of paralysis similar to wild poliovirus. Monitoring for VDPV is a crucial component of polio eradication efforts, involving regular testing of sewage and clinical samples. Transitioning from OPV to inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in routine immunization schedules can reduce the risk of VDPV emergence.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA VDPV (Vaccine-derived Poliovirus) VAPP (Vaccine-associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis) Definition Poliovirus that has genetically evolved from the strain contained in the oral polio vaccine (OPV) Paralysis caused by the live, attenuated poliovirus in the oral polio vaccine (OPV) Source Originates from the weakened virus in the OPV Results from the live, attenuated virus present in the OPV Transmission Can circulate in communities where vaccine coverage is low, leading to outbreaks Generally occurs in the individual who received the OPV, leading to localized cases Associated Risk Factors Related to low vaccine coverage and prolonged circulation of the virus in the population Typically occurs in individuals who receive OPV, especially those with certain immune deficiencies</p>\n<p></p>",
