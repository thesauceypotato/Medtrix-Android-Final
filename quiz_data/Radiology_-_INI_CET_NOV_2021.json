      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1 and 2 are true Placenta accreta (PA) occurs when a defect of the decidua basalis allows the invasion of chorionic villi into the myometrium. It is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality and is now the most common reason for emergent postpartum hysterectomy Placenta previa and previous cesarean section are the two most important known risk factors for PA. Ultrasonography (US) remains the diagnostic standard, and routine US examination at 18\u201320 weeks gestation affords an ideal opportunity to screen for the disorder. Placental lacunae and abnormal color Doppler imaging patterns are the most helpful US markers for PA.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>In recent years, there has been increased interest in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for the evaluation of PA, since it can provide information on depth of invasion and more clearly depict posterior placentas. The most reliable MR imaging findings are uterine bulging, heterogeneous placenta, and placental bands. MR Imaging Findings in PA: Placenta previa Uterine bulging Heterogeneous signal intensity within the placenta Dark intraplacental bands on T2-weighted images Focal interruptions in the myometrial wall Tenting of the bladder Direct visualization of the invasion of pelvic structures by placental tissue</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option A.

Typically, the placenta detaches from the uterine wall after childbirth. With placenta accreta, part or all of the placenta remains attached.

For the head or neck evaluation, a high-resolution, small-part transducer with higher frequencies is used, most commonly between 7.5 and 10 MHz. The higher the frequency, the better the spatial resolution.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>For head and neck, ultrasonography requires a window that is unimpeded by bone or air, limiting the type of evaluations it offers, when compared with CT scanning or MRI. B-mode ultrasonography shows the texture and tissue borders as black and white pictures. Color duplex ultrasonography allows for visualization of moving tissues and blood flow. Doppler ultrasonography allows differentiation of the vessels.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explaination for incorrect options:- Option B. MRI Option C. Radiography Option D. Fluoroscopy The given image in question shows usg, hence all other options are incorrect.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>ALSO NOTE: Echogenicity is the ability of a surface to bounce an echo or return a signal. Hyperechoic structures are more \u201cbright\u201d than their surroundings, whereas hypoechoic structures are less \u201cbright\u201d than their surroundings. Anechoic structures appear black, without echoes; whereas isoechoic structures have the same echoes as their surroundings. Acoustic impedance is transmission and reflection across 2 different boundaries/surfaces. Acoustic shadowing shows areas through which sound waves fail to propagate. Acoustic enhancement is when no echoes are reflected and sound is allowed to pass through, allowing echoes deep to the anechoic structures to be visible. Fluid-filled structures provide acoustic enhancement, whereas deeper structures will appear more \u201cbright.\u201d Refraction is produced from the multiple reflections from an object if the acoustical impedances of tissue layers are too different. Attenuation is the reduction of the ultrasound beam as it passes through a medium.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
