Static test or Fodere's test: The test based on lung weight useful in the diagnosis of live birth is static test . The average weight of both lungs before respiration is 35 gm and after respiration is 70 gm. There is no comparison with the body weight.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Static test or Fodere's test:</li><li>\u2022 test based on lung weight useful in the diagnosis of live birth is static test</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Raygat\u2019s test (Hydrostatic test, Breslau\u2019s 1st life test): Raygat\u2019s test is based on specific gravity of lung . The specific gravity of a non-respired lung is 1040-1050 and of a respired lung is 940-950, so, after respiration lung floats on water (specific gravity of water is 1000). There is no comparison of lung weight to body weight.</li><li>\u2022 Option C.

Wredin's test: This test is based on the fact that before birth middle ear contains gelatinous embryonic tissue , which is replaced by air after respiration. So, the presence of air in middle ears denotes live birth. There is no role of weight of lungs.</li><li>\u2022 Option D.
