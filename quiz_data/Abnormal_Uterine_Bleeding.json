The patient had inter-menstrual bleeding for the past 8 months and this has now become progressively prolonged such that she has been bleeding on almost all days of the month. The patient previously used an LNG-IUS for contraception for 10 years but had it removed a year earlier after her husband underwent a vasectomy. She takes no medication and is a non-smoker. Her BMI is 38. Abdominal exam is normal and bimanual exam is also normal. There are no cervical or vaginal lesions. A hysteroscopic biopsy is done which shows simple endometrial hyperplasia.
