High myopia causes pseudo-proptosis. The prominence of the eyeball without any space-occupying lesion in the orbit is called pseudo-proptosis . It is seen in high myopia due to an increase in the size of the eyeball and can also be seen in lid retraction, shallow orbits, and unilateral enophthalmos. Option: B. Orbital cellulitis is a purulent inflammation of the cellular tissue of the orbit. It is most frequently due to the extension of inflammation from the neighboring parts, especially the nasal sinuses.

Visual acuity and ocular motility are normal and there are no signs of proptosis. Option: B . Varicosity of the orbital veins causes intermittent proptosis . This occurs especially when the head is depressed and is increased by pressure on the corresponding jugular vein or by performing a Valsalva manoeuvre.
