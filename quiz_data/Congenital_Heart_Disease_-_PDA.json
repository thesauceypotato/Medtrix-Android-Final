      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Prostaglandin inhibitor- Ibuprofen in the first week of life The diagnosis in question is patent ductus arteriosus.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A, C. Prostaglandin inhibitor is indomethacin NOT analogue. Option: D. Given during 1st week of life</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>When the ductus is structurally intact, a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor (indomethacin or ibuprofen) may be used in the first week of life to induce closure. A PDA courses between the aortic isthmus and the origin of one of the branch pulmonary arteries. Small PDAs are often silent to auscultation and do not cause hemodynamic changes. The classic murmur is heard best just below the left clavicle and typically extends from systole past the second heart sound into diastole, reflecting flow turbulence and gradient between the aorta and the pulmonary arteries (resulting in left-to-right shunting). Large PDAs will lead to left heart dilation and may lead to chronically elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, including the potential for ES.</p>\n<p></p>",
