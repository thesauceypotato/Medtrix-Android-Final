This likely scenario here appears to be of Peptic ulcer disease ( PUD ) Ulcers are defined as breaks in the mucosal surface > 5 mm in size, with depth to the submucosa A peptic ulcer is defined as disruption of the mucosal integrity of the stomach and/or duodenum leading to a local defect or excavation due to active inflammation GI bleeding is the most common complication observed in PUD (~15%).

Among patients with persistent severe DDS (such as seizures, encephalopathy, or coma) despite the use of sodium modeling, a trial of hypertonic saline or mannitol is reasonable, where available. Either 5 mL of 23 percent saline or 12.5 g of mannitol is used to rapidly raise the serum osmolality and to prevent further osmotic shifts.</p>\n<p></p>",
