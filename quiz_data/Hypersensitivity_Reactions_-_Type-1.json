In many instances (e.g., allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma), a second, late-phase reaction sets in 2 to 24 hours later without additional exposure to antigen and may last for several days. This late-phase reaction is characterized by infiltration of tissues with eosinophils, neutrophils, basophils, monocytes, and CD4+ T cells, as well as tissue destruction , typically in the form of mucosal epithelial cell damage.

The hallmark of SLE is the production of autoantibodies, several of which (antibodies to double-stranded DNA and the so-called Smith [Sm] antigen ) are virtually diagnostic. Exposure to ultraviolet ( UV) light exacerbates the disease in many individuals . UV irradiation may induce apoptosis in cells and may alter the DNA in such a way that it becomes immunogenic, perhaps because of enhanced recognition by Toll-Like In addition, UV light may modulate the immune response, for example, by stimulating keratinocytes to produce IL-1, a cytokine known to promote inflammation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: B.
