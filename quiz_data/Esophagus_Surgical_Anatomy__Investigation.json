It is usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during the autopsy, laparotomy, or barium studies. The most common clinical presentation is gastrointestinal bleeding (25-50%) , with painless bright red blood from the rectum being the most common symptom in children younger than 2 years old. Chronic acid-induced ulcers in the ileum adjacent to a Meckel's Diverticulum containing gastric mucosa are the source of bleeding.

Diagnosis Chest X-ray: Hydropneumothorax The diagnosis is confirmed with a contrast esophagogram. This technique will demonstrate extravasation in 90% of patients. Gastrografin (water soluble) is preferred to prevent extravasation of barium into the mediastinum or pleura{less risk of mediastinitis}. If no leak is seen, a barium study should follow. Chest CT: Mediastinal air and fluid at the site of perforation. Endoscopy: If the esophagogram is negative or if operative intervention is planned The X-ray findings further support those diagnoses. CT scan of the chest is used to confirm the diagnosis of Boerhaave syndrome in patients who are hemodynamically unstable or otherwise not suited to undergo contrast esophagography. While bedside testing is usually preferred over a CT scan for unstable patients (e.g., TEE to confirm aortic dissection), there is no bedside imaging available to reliably confirm the diagnosis of esophageal rupture.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Boerhaave Syndrome: Spontaneous rupture usually occurs on the left posterolateral side of the distal esophagus, into the left pleural cavit y or just above the gastroesophageal junction. Typically, male patients (85%) aged between 40 to 60 years with a recent history of vomiting are affected. Clinical Features Spontaneous esophageal perforation is characterized by Mackler's triad of thoracic pain, vomiting, and cervical subcutaneous emphysema. Thoracic perforations cause substernal and epigastric pain. While mediastinal emphysema and pleural effusions are common, early cervical subcutaneous emphysema is observed in only 20% or less of patients. Increasing contamination and inflammation of the mediastinum and pleural cavities lead to fever and sepsis . Patients with an abdominal perforation experience epigastric abdominal pain, which is also frequently referred to the back and left shoulder.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) may be used to diagnose Boerhaave syndrome if other imaging techniques are inconclusive. Because EGD increases the likelihood of esophageal leak, it is typically reserved for patients with poorly localized esophageal perforation and in whom endoscopic treatment is already indicated. Option: B. In the past, aortography was used to detect aortic dissection. This patient has severe retrosternal pain radiating to his back and is hemodynamically unstable, which may be seen in patients with aortic dissection. However, the patient's recent alcohol intake followed by several episodes of vomiting and the presence of crepitus over the thorax favour the diagnosis of Boerhaave syndrome, which is confirmed with a different method. Option: D. Abdominal ultrasound may be performed in the case of suspected acute pancreatitis. This patient had several vomiting episodes following alcohol consumption, accompanied by pain radiating to the back. This presentation may resemble that of acute pancreatitis. But the pain in acute pancreatitis is typically located in the upper abdomen, and the patient would not have crepitus over the thorax.

Although this patient has several risk factors for aortic dissection (e.g., hypertension, smoking) and tearing pain that radiates to his back, mediastinal emphysema would not be an expected finding in a patient with aortic dissection. Also, patients with aortic dissection often have asymmetrical blood pressure and pulse readings between the limbs. This patient's symptoms after upper endoscopy suggests another diagnosis. Option: B. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD ) should be delayed in this patient with suspected iatrogenic esophageal perforation as the endoscope and/or air insufflation may cause further dissection of the perforation. If esophageal rupture is suspected, diagnostic endoscopy is reserved for patients with a poorly localized esophageal perforation on standard imaging and in whom endoscopic treatment is indicated. EGD should be considered if this patient's symptoms of burning epigastric pain were due to worsening gastritis \u2013 however, mediastinal emphysema is highly suggestive of esophageal perforation. Option: C. Abdominal ultrasound is the most useful initial test for diagnosing acute pancreatitis. Although this patient's radiating upper abdominal pain and history of alcohol use may suggest acute pancreatitis, his normal lipase level makes pancreatic involvement highly unlikely. In addition, pancreatitis does not explain subcutaneous emphysema present on exam. An abdominal ultrasound would have limited utility in establishing the diagnosis in this case.</p>\n<p></p>",

Other etiologies of perforation can include spontaneous rupture of the esophagus (Boerhaave syndrome) or trauma. Diagnosis is typically confirmed and the location of the perforation can be identified with a contrast esophagram. Because some contained perforations can be managed nonoperatively, an esophagram can also be useful in determining operative strategy. A study using water-soluble contrast (such as a Gastrografin swallow ) is typically ordered initially; if no leak is identified, the study is repeated using thin barium . A water-soluble contrast is used initially because of concerns for mediastinitis due to barium in the presence of esophageal perforation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Chest X- ray : The presence of hydropneumothorax indicates possible esophageal perforation. The diagnosis can be confirmed through a contrast esophagogram , which is a technique that can detect extravasation of contrast material in 90% of cases. To minimize the risk of barium extravasation into the mediastinum or pleura, Gastrografin (a water-soluble contrast agent) is preferred over barium. If no leak is detected, a barium study may be conducted. Chest CT scan can reveal the presence of mediastinal air and fluid at the site of perforation.

Options: C & D. Endoscopy may be useful in treating the perforation with an esophageal stent or with clipping, both of which are reserved for select cases. In other scenarios (such as after a traumatic injury), pneumomediastinum can result from injury to the tracheobronchial tree, so in those cases, bronchoscopy may be warranted as part of the workup. Laryngoscopy and fiberoptic bronchoscopy is not needed in this case.</p>\n<p></p>",

This condition is also known as the columnar-lined esophagus. The most common type of columnar epithelium observed in this condition is the intestinal epithelium (intestinal metaplasia). Chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the usual cause of this transformation, which is often associated with a sliding hiatal hernia. Patients with Barrett's esophagus often have a long history of heartburn and other reflux symptoms, and experience more frequent and severe reflux episodes than most patients with reflux symptoms. They are more likely to be obese, male, and of white ethnicity. Barrett's esophagus is a significant risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Endoscopic surveillance is an acceptable alternative to more invasive treatment options for patients with confirmed low-grade dysplasia, but it is no longer the recommended choice of management. Additionally, a repeat upper GI endoscopy should be performed every 12 rather than 18 months after the initial examination for early detection of progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma as soon as possible. Option: C. Esophagectomy is indicated in the treatment of esophageal adenocarcinomas in suitable surgical candidates and may be combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy in patients with submucosal invasion. However, it is a complex surgical procedure with considerable morbidity and mortality and, thus, should only be performed if there is no alternative therapeutic option. Since this patient's biopsy results show low-grade dysplasia of the esophageal mucosa rather than adenocarcinoma, less invasive treatment is indicated. Option: D . The combination therapy of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole is used for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in colonized patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia or confirmed peptic ulcer disease. However, it has no proven benefit in the treatment of GERD and is therefore not recommended here. In contrast, monotherapy with proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole plays an important role in the maintenance therapy of complications of GERD, such as Barrett's esophagus, in that they prevent the expansion of intestinal metaplasia and reduce the risk of malignant transformation to invasive carcinoma. Accordingly, medical therapy with omeprazole alone would be indicated in this patient.</p>\n<p></p>",

Zenker diverticulum is a false diverticulum (herniation of mucosa and submucosa only) that typically herniates through Killian's triangle at the dorsal hypopharynx. Zenker\u2019s diverticulum is a false diverticulum located in the Proximal 1/3 rd of esophagus that occurs due to increased pressure. The diagnostic test of choice to confirm Zenker diverticulum is barium esophagram with dynamic continuous fluoroscopy{Barium swallow }.

Symptoms are reflective of pharyngeal dysphagia when the diverticulum is small, and as it enlarges, it fills with food upon eating, leading to halitosis and oesophageal dysphagia . Diagnosis is made by barium esophagram, which shows the diverticulum filled with barium resting posteriorly alongside the esophagus. Lateral views are critical as Zenker's diverticulum is usually a posterior structure. Esophageal manometry and endoscopy are not necessary for diagnosis.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: B. Esophageal manometry is useful to identify esophageal motility disorders, such as achalasia. This patient presents with some typical features of achalasia including dysphagia and regurgitation. However, achalasia often causes weight loss, which is not the case here, and it would not explain the bubbling sounds while eating. Esophageal manometry is also useful for detecting esophageal involvement in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), which often presents with Raynaud disease, which this patient has. The absence of other characteristic findings of SSc, such as thickening and hardening of the skin or sclerodactyly, however, makes this diagnosis less likely. Option: C. A CT scan of the neck is indicated in the diagnostic staging of esophageal cancers. This patient's dysphagia and regurgitation could be symptoms of an esophageal tumour, for which her smoking history and family history are risk factors. However, the absence of weight loss and anaemia, together with the gurgling sound this patient hears while eating, is more suggestive of a different diagnosis. Also, a CT scan of the neck and chest would not be the confirmatory test in the diagnosis of esophageal cancers. Larger outpouching can be an incidental finding on CT scans of some individuals with Zenker diverticulum. However, a CT scan is not routinely used to confirm or exclude this diagnosis. Option: D. Serology and PCR can be used to detect Trypanosoma cruzi , the pathogen that causes Chagas disease. Chagas disease may present with achalasia (megaesophagus), which typically leads to dysphagia and regurgitation, as seen in this patient. This patient's visits to Mexico, which is endemic for Chagas disease, increase her risk for this condition. However, megaesophagus typically occurs in the chronic phase of Chagas disease (approx. after 10\u201320 years), which is inconsistent with her travel history. Moreover, the chronic phase of Chagas disease would usually present with other symptoms including arrhythmias due to cardiomyopathy (ECG shows no abnormalities) and/or abdominal complaints due to involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, neither of which is the case here.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Conventional surgical treatment involves an open left cervical incision with diverticulectomy and cricopharyngeus myotomy.

Newer techniques involve the transoral introduction of a linear stapler to divide the septum between the diverticulum and the true esophageal lumen, creating a common channel.

Achalasia refers to the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax . Both the muscle of the esophagus and LES are affected. The prevailing theory suggests that the destruction of the nerves to LES is the primary pathology, and degeneration of the neuromuscular function of the body of the esophagus is secondary. It is a premalignant condition that may lead to squamous cell carcinoma. Achalasia can be seen in Triple-A syndrome or Allgrove disease , which involves Achalasia, Alacrima, and ACTH-resistant Adrenal insufficiency . It is caused by progressive inflammation and selective loss of inhibitory myenteric neurons in Auerbach\u2019s plexus of the esophagus that normally secrete VIP and nitric oxide . This results in the failure of relaxation of LES and aperistalsis of the esophageal body, leading to functional obstruction at the level of the GE junction and gradual dilatation of the esophagus. The classic triad of symptoms includes dysphagia , regurgitation , and weight loss . Other symptoms commonly seen are heartburn, postprandial choking, and nocturnal coughing.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Options: A, B & C. Initial management of achalasia may include medications (calcium-channel blockers or long-acting nitrates) and other management options such as endoscopic dilation or injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) into the LES. However, symptoms frequently recur and patients need to undergo repeated procedures with the associated risk of perforation. Surgery results in an improvement in more than 90% of patients, compared with only 70% of patients treated by forceful dilatation.</p>\n<p></p>",

Most cases are \u201cprimary\u201d or of unknown origin. They may be caused by degenerative changes in neural innervation; the myenteric ganglia are usually absent from the body of the esophagus. There is a long-term risk of the development of squamous cell carcinoma.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Achalasia Cardia is a common hypomotility disorder of the esophagus. The term \" achalasia \" refers to the sphincter's inability to relax, resulting in sustained tone with intermittent relaxation. Both the muscle of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) are affected by this disorder. The prevailing theory suggests that the primary pathology is the destruction of nerves that control the LES, with secondary degeneration of neuromuscular function in the body of the esophagus. Achalasia Cardia is a premalignant condition that may lead to squamous cell carcinoma.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Meckel's diverticulum RECTAL BLEEDING: Unlike in adults, malignancy is an exceptionally rare cause of rectal bleeding in children. In newborns, the life-threatening causes are malrotation and necrotising enterocolitis, and in older infants and children, intussusception. The quantities of blood loss are small but the conditions are serious. Other causes include anal fissures, juvenile polyps and certain gastroenteritides (e.g. Campylobacter infection ). The 4-year-old patient who presents with haemoglobin (Hb) of 40 g/L will most likely have bled profusely from an ulcer adjacent to a Meckel\u2019s diverticulum containing ectopic gastric mucosa. A technetium scan may confirm the presence of ectopic gastric mucosa. A Meckel\u2019s diverticulum may also be complicated by an obstructing band between the diverticulum and the umbilicus, diverticulitis, intussusception, intestinal volvulus or perforation.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Meckel\u2019s diverticulum Meckel's Diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the small intestine, found in about 2% of the population. It follows the rule of two: 2% prevalence, 2 inches in length, half of the symptomatic cases are in children younger than 2 years old, 2 feet proximal to the ileocecal valve, and it's a true diverticulum with all three layers of the intestine. It occurs due to incomplete closure of the omphalomesenteric or vitellointestinal duct and has an equal incidence in men and women. The most common heterotopic tissue found in Meckel's Diverticulum is gastric mucosa (50%), followed by pancreatic mucosa (5%) and rarely colonic mucosa. It is usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during the autopsy, laparotomy, or barium studies. The most common clinical presentation is gastrointestinal bleeding , with painless bright red blood from the rectum being the most common symptom in children younger than 2 years old.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation For Incorrect Options:- Option: A. It is common in older infants not in patients who are 4 years old. Option: C. It is common in a firstborn male child to present with projectile non-bilious vomiting 2-3 weeks after birth. Option: D. It presents early in the newborn as frothing and inability to feed, also not able to insert NGT into the stomach as one end of the esophagus is blind.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Chronic acid-induced ulcers in the ileum adjacent to a Meckel's Diverticulum containing gastric mucosa are the source of bleeding. Intestinal obstruction occurs in 31% of cases of Meckel\u2019s Diverticulum and is due to volvulus, intussusception, or, rarely, incarceration of the diverticulum in an inguinal hernia ( Littre's hernia ).</p>\n<p></p>",
