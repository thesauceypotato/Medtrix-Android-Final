A gastric volvulus occurs when the stomach rotates on itself at least 180 degrees along its transverse or longitudinal axis. Gastric strangulation is a complication that can occur after the development of acute gastric volvulus. Option B. Cecal volvulus describes torsion of the cecum around its mesentery which often results in obstruction Option D. Meckel's diverticulum is a true diverticulum, containing all layers of the small bowel wall. They arise from the antimesenteric surface of the middle-to-distal ileum. The diverticulum represents a persistent remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, which connects the midgut to the yolk sac in the foetus</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The most common sites of volvulus are the sigmoid colon and cecum [1-4].

The diagnosis is best made on MRI where it is characterized by several small regions of susceptibility artifact at the grey-white matter junction, in the corpus callosum, and in more severe cases in the brainstem, surrounded by FLAIR hyperintensity.</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA</p>\n<p></p>",
