      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Gives origin to most of the cauda equina The conus medullaris and cauda equina give rise to spinal nerves L2-S5 and the coccygeal nerve. The anterior rami of these spinal nerves contribute to the lumbar and sacral plexuses, which provide motor and sensory innervation to the entire lower limb, pelvic and perineal regions.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Cauda equina syndrome Cauda equina syndrome is caused by a compression or irritation of lumbosacral spinal nerve roots, often due to lumbar disc herniation. The most common symptoms include low back pain that radiates into the sacral region and legs, and bilateral motor and sensory deficits, which present as asymmetric saddle anaesthesia (S2-S5 dermatomes) and asymmetric lower limb weakness. Additional clinical features may include loss of bladder control (urinary retention), faecal incontinence and erectile dysfunction, which are often late findings and less frequent.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options: - Option: A. Exhibits both a cervical and lumbar enlargement Located at L2, the conus medullaris is the proper tapered spinal cord termination. Most of the cauda equina originate from the conus medullaris and then travel to the vertebral foramina inferior. Although the spinal cord exhibits both a cervical and a lumbar enlargement, the conus medullaris refers to the termination of the spinal cord, not the entire spinal cord. Option: B. Has a modification of neural tissue extending from its termination to the coccygeal ligament. There is no modified neural tissue extending from the termination of the conus medullaris to the coccygeal ligament. Instead, the filum terminal internum, a thread-like extension of the pia mater, extends from the conus medullaris. Eventually, this terminal internum becomes enclosed in the filum terminale externum, a thread-like extension of the dura mater extending below the end of the dural sac (at the S2 level). The filum terminal externum attaches to the coccyx, forming the coccygeal ligament. Option: D. The conus medullaris is located at L2, at the term examination of the spinal cord. The dural sac, however, continues to the S2 level.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Conus medullaris syndrome Conus medullaris syndrome, although quite similar, is clinically distinct from cauda equina syndrome. This syndrome is much less common and is typically caused by tumours or vascular anomalies within the spinal canal. It is characterised by symmetric saddle anaesthesia and symmetric weakness in the lower extremities, with associated bladder dysfunction and early bowel incontinence.</p>\n<p></p>",
