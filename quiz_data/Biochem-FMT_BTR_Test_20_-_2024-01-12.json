His medications include lithium and escitalopram. The patient has a history of 5 psychiatric hospitalizations and 2 past suicide attempts, including overdose on his medications and attempted hanging. The patient has been using \"anything I can get my hands on\" because his depression is unbearable. He is hospitalized and placed on suicide precautions. His dose of escitalopram is increased to target his depression, and risperidone is added to treat the hallucinations. His lithium level is 1.0 mEq/L. On the second day of hospitalization, the patient reports muscle pains, abdominal cramping, nausea, and diarrhea. His temperature is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 130/85 mm Hg, and pulse is 84/min. The patient is alert and restless, and his pupils are dilated bilaterally. Bowel sounds are hyperactive and neurologic examination is normal. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for his symptoms?",

A 23-year-old man enrolled in the study is found to excrete large amounts of fructose in his urine compared to other study participants despite maintaining a moderate fructose intake. Further evaluation shows a hereditary defect in fructose metabolism, but he is asymptomatic and has no other medical problems.
