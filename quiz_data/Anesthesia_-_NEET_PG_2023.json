      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Head tilt, chin lift The maneuver performed in the given image is that of a head-tilt chin-lift. It is an important technique in emergency airway management to open up the airway.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Basic life support (BLS) involves early recognition and management of emergencies such as heart attack, stroke, and foreign body airway obstruction. The sequence of BLS is circulation (chest compression), airway and breathing. The airway is usually obstructed by posterior displacement of the tongue or epiglottis. Procedure : One hand (palm) is placed on the patient's forehead, applying pressure to tilt the head back. Simultaneously, the chin is lifted with the forefinger and index finger of the opposite hand. This causes cervical flexion with an atlanto- occipital extension (sniffing position). This lifts the tongue from the back of the throat. Head-tilt chin-lift should not be performed in a patient with suspected cervical injury.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>All patients with a head injury should be considered to be suffering from cervical spine injury until proved otherwise Since the removal of a hard collar is often required for intubation, manual stabilization is preferred over collar stabilization.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Bone marrow aspiration This is not the bone marrow aspiration procedure.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>The intraosseous route is an emergency route that was previously recommended for children less than 6 years of age but now can be used at any age, anything including fluids can be given and is preferred over the endotracheal route. A large bore needle is inserted just below the tibial tuberosity and the drug/fluid is injected directly into the medullary cavity. The rate of absorption of the drug is almost equal to the intravascular route.</p>\n<p></p>",
