      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Narcolepsy Narcolepsy is a long-term neurological disorder that involves a decreased ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. Symptoms often include periods of excessive daytime sleepiness and brief involuntary sleep episodes. About 70% of those affected also experience episodes of sudden loss of muscle strength, known as cataplexy.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Pitolisant also called as tiprolisant ORPHAN drug It is a potent, orally active histamine H3 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist acts by blockade of histamine auto-receptors and enhances the activity of brain histaminergic neurons, a major arousal system with widespread projections to the whole brain used to treat narcolepsy with or without cataplexy</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Epilepsy is a group of non-communicable neurological disorders characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures. An epileptic seizure is the clinical manifestation of an abnormal, excessive, purposeless and synchronized electrical discharge in the brain cells called neurons. Option: B. Cataplex y is a sudden muscle weakness that occurs while a person is awake. Strong emotions trigger cataplexy. The triggering experiences are usually positive, like laughter, witty conversations, and pleasant surprise. Episodes may also be triggered by anger, but rarely by stress, fear, or physical exertion. Option: D. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by low weight, food restriction, body image disturbance, fear of gaining weight, and an overpowering desire to be thin. Anorexia is a term of Greek origin: an- (\u1f00\u03bd-, prefix denoting negation) and orexis ( \"appetite\"), translating literally to \"a loss of appetite\".</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>Medications\n  used to treat narcolepsy EDS and their most common side effects in clinical\n  practice Drug Most\n  common side effects References Modafinil Headache,\n  nausea, insomnia, anxiety, especially in the first days of treatment [10-13,\n  15] Methylphenidate Tachycardia,\n  hypertension, palpitations, neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety,\n  irritability), weight loss [16] Sodium\n  oxybate Dizziness,\n  headache, nausea, weight loss, restless leg syndrome, parasomnias\n  (sleepwalking, enuresis), neuropsychiatric symptoms (confusion, anxiety,\n  depressive symptoms) [17-19] Pitolisant a Headache,\n  nausea, insomnia [20,\n  21] Amphetamines b Cardiac\n  arrhythmias, hypertension, neuropsychiatric symptoms (irritability,\n  aggressiveness, psychotic symptoms), insomnia, abnormal movements [22,\n  23] Mazindol a Dry\n  mouth, nervousness, constipation, rare reports of pulmonary hypertension and\n  valvular heart disease [24,\n  25]</p>\n<p></p>",

Cyproheptadine primarily blocks 5-HT2A receptors and has additional H1 antihistaminic, antimuscarinic and sedative properties. So, it has no role in beta-adrenergic receptors. Antihistaminic activity : It is used for allergies and is a good antipruritic. It increases appetite in children as well as in poor eaters and promotes weight gain . Anti-5-HT activity: It controls the intestinal manifestations of carcinoid and post-gastrectomy dumping syndromes . Also used in priapism/ orgasmic delay caused by 5-HT uptake inhibitors like fluoxetine and trazodone. .</p>\n<p></p>",
