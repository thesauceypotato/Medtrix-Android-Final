The preferred management would be to initiate neoadjuvant chemotherapy with three cycles of paclitaxel + carboplatin over three weeks , followed by debulking/cytoreductive surgery, and then continue another three cycles of chemotherapy. However, patients with advanced disease and poor general condition are unfit for anesthesia and surgery at the time of presentation and have a higher operative risk, hence neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery is preferred and has been shown to reduce morbidity in such patients.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Stagewise Management of Ovarian Tumors Stage Management Low malignant potential tumors Surgical staging. No postoperative treatment required Stage I (A or B) Grade I and II Surgical staging. No postoperative treatment required Note: In a young woman who wish to preserve fertility if intraoperative findings are consistent with stage I, unilateral salpingo oophorectomy may be performed. The uterus and the contralateral ovary can be removed later when the patient has completed child bearing. Stage I (A or B) Grade III and all grades of Stages IC and II Surgical staging followed by three to six cycles of chemotherapy postoperatively. Advanced ovarian cancer - Stage III/IV Cytoreduction or debulking surgery followed by six cycle of platinum based chemotherapy (carboplatin + paclitaxel preferred) each cycle given after 3 weeks.

The usual approach in Stage I and II disease where the patient is fit for surgery, is to perform cytoreductive surgery, which also helps in determining the extent of disease, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (Option A). Option: C. Ovarian tumors are not radiosensitive and radiotherapy does not form part of the protocol for treatment of ovarian cancers. Option: D. Staging laparotomy is the term used to describe the procedure of surgically exploring patients with early-stage disease and would not be the approach in a patient with advanced disease in whom chemotherapy followed by debulking surgery is indicated.</p>\n<p></p>",

Although there is a reset in the threshold for response to ADH, the levels of ADH remain unchanged. Although all components of blood are increased during pregnancy, plasma volume is increased more than the RBC volume, leading to a relative hemodilution, responsible for what is termed as physiological anaemia of pregnancy. The increased plasma volume is beneficial as it reduces blood viscosity , allowing for effective gaseous exchange in placental and fetal circulation, it is protective against the possible adverse effects of change in posture causing vascular compression, and also against the possible blood loss during delivery</p>\n<p><strong>Table:</strong></p><p>#MANTRA Hematological changes in pregnancy Increases Decreases Hemoglobin mass Hemoglobin concentration Total plasma protein S. urea/Creatinine/Uric acid Globulin Albumin Neutrophils Platelets Fibrinogen Blood urea nitrogen Factors 7,8,9,10 Factor 11,13 Insulin S.

In the event of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) , bleeding occurs from the uterine artery which is the primary vessel ligated, and the inflow from the ovarian artery compensates to prevent ischaemia. The arterial supply to the uterus is by two main arteries : the uterine artery, which is a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery, and the ovarian artery which is a direct branch of the abdominal aorta. Ligating the uterine artery limits the supply from the internal iliac artery and hence the ovarian artery serves as the alternate blood supply. The uterine artery runs from its origin towards the cervix, crosses the ureter and then ascends with a tortuous course along the lateral aspect of the uterus up to ovary, where it anastomoses with the ovarian artery. It is based on this anatomical relationship that the order of ligation of vessels to arrest bleeding in atonic postpartum hemorrhage is the uterine artery > ovarian artery > internal iliac artery.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: C.

The best treatment is administration of antihypertensives & artificial rupture of membranes. The clinical scenario of painful antepartum haemorrhage associated with pre-eclampsia (hypertension + proteinuria) and fetal death is suggestive of Grade 2 abruptio placentae. In this case, as there is fetal death and the patient is in labor, the best approach would be to administer antihypertensives and deliver the fetus vaginally.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Abruptio placenta is the partial/total placental separation from its implantation site before delivery. The bleeding may be: Revealed - blood dissects downwards between membranes and uterine wall to escape through the cervix Concealed - blood accumulates between the detached placenta and uterus, and the uterus is larger than expected for the period of gestation Mixed - features of both co-existing Hypertension in pregnancy is the most important risk factor for abruptio placenta. Spasm of the decidual spiral artery leads to endothelial damage and extravasation of blood in the placental bed, leading to fetal distress. Patients often present with sudden onset abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, uterine tenderness, and frequent contractions. Based on the degree of placental separation, patients are clinically graded as follows: Grade 0 - Asymptomatic, abruption is diagnosed only after delivery by the presence of retroplacental clots. Grade 1 - Vaginal bleeding, mild uterine tetani. No maternal and fetal complications. Grade 2 - With fetal distress or death Grade 3 - With maternal complications like shock, renal failure, coagulopathy, or death. The management of abruption is based on whether the patient is in labor and the fetal status, with the goal being to expedite delivery and prevent complications such as shock and coagulopathy. Immediate management begins with the administration of IV crystalloids and arrangement of blood for the patient, along with BP control. If the patient is in labor and the cervix is favourable, in case the fetal heart rate is reassuring, or in case the fetal has died - amniotomy and vaginal delivery. If the patient is not in labor or fetal heart tracing indicate fetal distress - an favourable, in case the fetal heart rate is reassuring, or in case the fetal has died amniotomy and vaginal delivery.

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Emergency Cesarean section In this patient, the membranes are intact and the ' bag of worms ' palpated refers to the umbilical cord within the membrane, suggestive of cord presentation. The best course of management would be to take the patient up for an emergency cesarean section. Cord presentation refers to the presence of the umbilical cord below the presenting part over the internal os, within an intact bag of membranes, whereas in the case of a cord prolapse, the membranes are ruptured and the cord lies externally. The goal of management in the event of a cord presentation is to expedite delivery while keeping the membranes intact, and hence the best option would be to deliver the fetus via emergency LSCS. While the patient is being prepared for surgery, she may be positioned in The exaggerated Sim's position to avoid cord compression.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for incorrect options:- Option: A. Oxytocin should not be started as the patient should not be allowed to proceed to deliver via normal vaginal delivery due to the risk of cord prolapse and fetal death. Option: B. The membranes should not be ruptured as this would lead to an overt cord prolapse and complicate the situation further. Option: D. Cord presentation is an obstetric emergency requiring immediate action.</p>\n<p></p>",
