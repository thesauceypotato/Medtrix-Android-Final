      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Somatic Hypermutation Somatic Hypermutation is a process in which point mutations accumulate in the antibody V-regions of both the heavy and light chains, at rates that are about 106-fold higher than the background mutation rates observed in other genes. Cells that emerge will  have a stronger and more specific response to the antigen - and this is called  affinity maturation. VDJ recombination is the process by which T cells and B cells randomly assemble different gene segments \u2013 known as variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes \u2013 in order to generate unique receptors (known as antigen receptors) that can collectively recognize many different types of molecule. During the process of splicing, introns are removed from the pre- mRNA by the spliceosome and exons are spliced back together. If the introns are not removed, the RNA would be translated into a nonfunctional protein. Splicing occurs in the nucleus  before the RNA migrates to the cytoplasm. Immunoglobulin class switching  is a biological mechanism that changes a B cell's production of antibody from one class to another; for example, from an isotype called IgM to an isotype called IgG</p>\n<p></p>",

Common serotypes associated are: O6, O8, O15, O25, O27, O153, O159, etc. It  is toxigenic but not invasive. . Pathogenesis: Attachment to intestinal mucosa is mediated by CFA (Colonization Factor Ag). . Toxins: Heat labile toxin or LT  (increased cAMP). Heat stable toxin or ST (increased cGMP). Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) : EPEC frequently cause infantile diarrhea (outbreaks) and rarely sporadic diarrhea in adults. It is non toxigenic and noninvasive. Mechanism of diarrhea: Adhesion to intestinal mucosa, mediated by plasmid coded bundle-forming pili. A/E lesions  (attaching and effacing lesions) on the intestinal epithelium. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) : O157: H7 (most common serotype). EHEC is usually transmitted by contaminated food, i.e. lettuce, spinach, sprouts and undercooked ground beef. Low infective dose (< 102 CFU) of EHEC can also initiate the infection. Pathogenesis: EHEC secretes a toxin called verocytotoxin or Shiga-like toxin Causes: HC (hemorrhagic colitis):Manifests as gross bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain and fecal leukocytosis but no fever. Hemorrhagic uremic syndrome (HUS): bloody diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, renal failure and encephalopathy but without fever. Diagnosis: Sorbitol MacConkey agar: EHEC in contrast to other E.coli, does not ferment sorbitol. Toxin detection:  Cytotoxicity in Vero cell lines (gold standard method). Fecal toxin antigen detection by ELISA or rapid tests. PCR can be used to detect gene coding for VT. Entero invasive E. coli (EIEC): Pathogenesis: EIEC is not toxigenic but invasive by nature (Unique Feature) . The epithelial cell invasion is mediated by a plasmid coded antigen called virulence marker antigen (VMA). Manifestations include ulceration of bowel, dysentery  (resembling shigellosis). Diagnosis: Detection of VMA by ELISA. HeLa cell invasion assay. Sereny test</p>\n<p></p>",

Function: to prevent leakage of transported solutes and water and seals the paracellular pathway. Hemidesmosomes are very small stud-like structures found in keratinocytes of the epidermis of skin that attach to the extracellular matrix. Hemidesmosomes can be categorized into two types based on their protein constituents. Type 1 hemidesmosomes are found in stratified and pseudo-stratified epithelium. Desmosome , also known as a macula adherens , is a cell structure specialized for cell-to-cell adhesion.

Cholera toxin (CT): Once established in the human small intestine, the organism produces a powerful enterotoxin called cholera toxin. It resembles heat-labile toxin (LT) of E. coli in its structure and function, but it is more potent. Zona occludens toxin: It disrupts the tight junctions between mucosal cells.</p>\n<p></p>",

It exhibits antigenic variation through recombination of its pili and surface proteins that interact with the immune system. Sexual transmission is possible through vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Sexual transmission may be prevented through the use of barrier protection. Perinatal transmission may occur during childbirth, and may be prevented by antibiotic treatment of the mother before birth and the application of antibiotic eye gel on the eyes of the newborn.

Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that infects hepatocytes. Transmission: with cats faeces. Infective forms of Toxoplasma gondii: Tachyzoites Bradyzoites Sporulated oocyst. Option: B . Balantidium coli is a large ciliated protozoan (50-130 um) and width 20-70 um). It inhabits the large intestine of man and causes ciliate dysentery. Infective stage: binucleate cyst; spherical, ellipsoid, 50-75mm, double layered cyst wall. The invasive form is the trophozoite. Option: C. Trichomonas: Flagellum There is only one stage in the life cycle of Trichomonas, trophozoite. vaginalis inhabits the lower genital tract of females and the urethra and prostate of males. Men : asymptomatic but can transmit the infection sexually. Women: manifests with malodorous vaginal discharge (often yellow), vulvar erythema  (\"strawberry cervix\") (Refer to the Image below) and itching, dysuria or urinary frequency. Treatment: All sexual partners must be treated concurrently (Metronidazole). Option: D. Balamuthia is a free living amoeba having pseudopodia. Neuro parasite.</p>\n<p></p>",
