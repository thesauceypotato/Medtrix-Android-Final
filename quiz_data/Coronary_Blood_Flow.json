      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>An increased left atrial pressure Atrial fibrillation is an arrhythmia in which the electrical activity of the atrium becomes disorganized and therefore unable to produce a coordinated atrial contraction . The absence of an arterial pulse reduces the emptying of the atria during diastole and results in an enlarged left atrium and increased left atrial pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>CVP waves: CVP is generally measured at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium. This is most commonly done via a central venous catheter placed through the right internal jugular vein. A normal CVP waveform contains five components. These components include three peaks (a, c, v) and two descents (x, y). The first peak is the a-wave, which immediately follows the P wave of the ECG waveform. The a-wave is a pressure increase that is due to atrial contraction at end-diastole. Shortly after the a-wave, there is a second peak, the c-wave. The c-wave immediately follows the R wave of the ECG waveform. This is a pressure increase due to tricuspid bulging into the atrium as a result of isovolumic ventricular contraction (IVC). Following the c-wave is the first major descent in the CVP waveform, the x-descent. The x-descent is a drop in atrial pressure during ventricular systole caused by atrial relaxation. At the trough of the x-descent, there is an increase in atrial pressure as the atrium begins to fill during late systole. This is called the v-wave. The v-wave corresponds to the end of the T-wave in the ECG waveform. The final aspect of the CVP waveform is the y-descent, which is due to an atrial pressure drop as blood enters the ventricle during diastole.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option A. The venous A wave represents atrial contraction and disappears due to the absence of an atrial beat. Decreased filling of the heart results in a decrease in stroke volume. Options C and D. Heart rate increases because the continuous electrical activity of the atria initiates a high rate of ventricular activity. Systemic blood pressure typically falls because of inadequate filling of the ventricles and the resulting decrease in stroke volume .</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>The waveforms seen in a normal JVP are:- a wave corresponds to atrial contraction and occurs just after the P wave (on ECG) and just before the first heart sound. c wave represents the bulging of the tricuspid valve into the right atrium during ventricular systole. x descent corresponds to the atrial relaxation during atrial diastole. v wave represents atrial filling during ventricular systole and peaks at the second heart sound. y descent represents the passive emptying of the right atrium into the right ventricle after the tricuspid valve opening.</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Coronary circulation A great increase in venous return also takes place with exercise, although the increase in venous return is not the primary cause of the increase in cardiac output.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Venous return is increased by the activity of the muscle and thoracic pumps; by mobilization of blood from the viscera; by increased pressure transmitted through the dilated arterioles to the veins; and by noradrenergically mediated venoconstriction, which decreases the volume of blood in the veins. Blood mobilized from the splanchnic area and other reservoirs may increase the amount of blood in the arterial portion of the circulation by as much as 30% during strenuous exercise.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option B. Renal circulation Option C. Hepato splanchnic circulation Option D. Cutaneous circulation The circulation to all these organs decreases during exercise to compensate for increased blood circulation to the skeletal muscles.</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>Circulatory Changes during Exercise When a muscle contracts, it compresses the vessels in it if it develops more than 10% of its maximal tension; when it develops more than 70% of its maximal tension, blood flow is completely stopped. Between contractions, however, flow is so greatly increased that blood flow per unit of time in a rhythmically contracting muscle is increased as much as 30-foldQ. Local mechanisms maintaining a high blood flow in exercising muscle include: a fall in tissue pO, a rise in tissue pCO , and accumulation of K+ and other vasodilator metabolites. The temperature rises in active muscle, and this further dilates the vessels. The systemic cardiovascular response to exercise that provides for the additional blood flow to contracting muscle depends on whether the muscle contractions are primarily isometric or primarily isotonic with the performance of external work. With the start of an isometric muscle contraction, the heart rate rises, probably as a result of psychic stimuli acting on the medulla oblongata. The increase is largely due to decreased vagal tone, although increased discharge of the cardiac sympathetic nerves plays some role. Within a few seconds of the onset of an isometric muscle contraction, systolic and diastolic blood pressures rise sharply. Stroke volume changes relatively little, and blood flow to the steadily contracting muscles is reduced as a result of the compression of their blood vessels. In addition, there is a net fall in total peripheral resistance due to vasodilation in exercising muscles. Consequently, systolic blood pressure rises only moderately, whereas diastolic pressure usually remains unchanged or falls. Cardiac output is increased during isotonic exercise to values that may exceed 35 L/min, the amount being proportional to the increase in The maximal heart rate achieved during exercise decreases with age. Both at rest and any given level of exercise, trained athletes have a larger stroke volume and lower heart rate than untrained individuals and they tend to have larger hearts. Training increases the maximal oxygen consumption (V\u00b7 O2max) that can be produced by exercise in an individual. A great increase in venous return also takes place with exercise, although the increase in venous return is not the primary cause of the increase in cardiac output.</p>\n<p></p>",
