Sickness absenteeism is a helpful index in the industry to assess the state of health of workers and their physical, mental, and social well-being. Causes of sickness absenteeism: Economic causes, social causes, medical causes, and non-occupational causes. Good factory management, adequate pre-placement examination, good human relations, and the application of ergonomics can prevent it.</p>\n<p></p>",

There is also evidence that it may cause carpel tunnel syndrome. Hand-held portable power tools such as grinders, sanders, impact wrenches, and air chisels transmit vibration into the operator's hands and arms. Regular and frequent exposure to hand-arm vibration can lead to permanent health effects. This is most likely when contact with a vibrating tool or work process is a regular part of a person's job. Occasional and/or infrequent low exposure is unlikely to cause ill health. Symptoms include any combination of: tingling and numbness in the fingers; not being able to feel things properly; loss of strength in the hands; fingers going white (blanching) and becoming red and painful on recovery (particularly in the cold and wet, and probably only in the fingertips at first). Symptoms may appear after only a few months of exposure for some people, but for others, they may take a few years.

Metres of air This is a case of Lead poisoning, also known as Plumbism. It is common among workers employed in manufacturing storage batteries, glass manufacture, shipbuilding, printing and pottery, rubber industry, etc. Increased lead concentration in the blood to 70\u00b5g/100ml is associated with clinical symptoms. c/fs: abdominal colic, constipation, loss of appetite, joint & muscle pain, persistent headache, blue lines on gum, anemia, foot, and wrist drop. Coproporphyrin in urine is a screening test. Lead in the urine of over 0.8 mg/litre and amino levulinic acid in the urine of more than 5 mg/litre indicates lead exposure. Lead poisoning has been a notifiable and compensable disease in India since 1924. The lead concentration in the working atmosphere should be kept below 2.0mg/10 cu. Metres of air</p>\n<p></p>",
