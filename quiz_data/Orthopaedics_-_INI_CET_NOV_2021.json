They are the only system that allows the surgeon to control the flexibility of the fixation. External fixators are the standard in treating open fractures with substantial soft-tissue injuries that require vascular procedures, fasciotomy, soft-tissue flaps, or multiple debridements, to avoid additional damage to an already compromised limb. The other indications for the application of an external fixator are polytrauma; fractures in children to avoid pin fixation through the growth plate; temporary joint bridging before later open reduction internal fixation (ORIF); and arthrodesis of the ankle, elbow, or knee. In these latter cases, external fixators are especially indicated in acute or chronic infections, in limb-lengthening procedures, and occasionally after corrective osteotomies There are three basic types of external fixators: standard pin fixator, ring fixator, and hybrid fixator. Standard uniplanar fixators can be used for almost every long bone fracture except those involving the proximal femur or humerus. They are commonly used for the stabilization of complex distal radius fractures. Standard uniplanar external fixator. Frontal (a) and lateral (b) radiographs of the wrist show a standard uniplanar external fixator. The device was placed to treat a comminuted distal radius fracture, with pins in the second metacarpal and radial shaft. An ulnar styloid fracture is also present. Ring fixators are made of thin wires under tension that are attached to circular or semicircular rings or frames. This technique was introduced by the Russian surgeon Ilizarov for limb-lengthening procedures. Ring external fixator. Radiograph shows a ring external fixator (Ilizarov) that transfixes a healing proxi- mal tibial fracture. A healing proximal fibular osteotomy is also seen. The third type of external fixator is called a hybrid fixator. It represents the combination of ring and standard uniplanar fixators. It is commonly used for treatment of the proximal and distal tibial fractures that are close to the joint</p>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>1,5,6,4,3 The Thomas Test is used to measure the flexibility of the hip flexors (To assess for shortness or contracture of the hip flexors) Impaired range of motion of the hip may be an underlying cause to other conditions such as: psoas syndrome; patellofemoral pain syndrome, lower back pain, osteoarthritis; rheumatoid arthritis. Often associated with athletes with complain of hip \"stiffness\" and reported \"snapping\" feeling when flexing at the waist</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Procedure 1 (Thomas Flexion): Patient supine with hips & knees flexed; while maintaining the unaffected hip & knee in flexion, have patient lower the affected leg into extension as far as it will go; watch for amount of flexion at hip & make sure that lumbar is flat. With the patient in this position, the examiner immobilizes the pelvis in its normal position. The pelvis should exhibit about 12\u00b0 of anterior inclination. This is what creates the lumbar lordosis. An increased flexion contracture in the hip can be compensated for by an increase in lumbar lordosis, in which case the patient only appears to assume a normal position. Findings: If the posterior knee will not touch the table then hip flexors are short. Procedure 2 (Rectus Femoris Contracture Test): Same as procedure #1, only patient is at end of table which will allow the therapist to see what the knee is doing in addition to the hip. Findings: As above, plus looking for the knee to extend which would indicate rectus femoris shortness. The Thomas test positive if the thigh is raised off the surface of the table. A positive test indicates a decrease in flexibility in the rectus femoris or iliopsoas muscles or both. In normal hip (Negative Thomas test), extension is only possible up to the neutral position (0\u00b0); the thigh lies at on the surface of the examining table. Further flexion can tilt the pelvis further upright. So long as the leg being examined remains in contact with the examining table, the angle of pelvic tilt achieved corresponds to the maximum hyperextension of the hip. The flexion contracture can be quantified by measuring the angle that the flexed, affected leg forms with the examining table. One of the limitations of Thomas test is that it merely determines the amount of hip extension possible at any given degree of pelvic flexion. Another problem is that there are better methods of measuring the flexibility of the iliopsoas complex. For example, positioning the patient in prone, stabilizing the pelvis, and then extending the thigh. The precise point at which the pelvis begins to rise marks the end of the hip motion and the beginning of pelvic and spine motion.</p>\n<p></p>",
