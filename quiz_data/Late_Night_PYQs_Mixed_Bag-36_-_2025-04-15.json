Phacoemulsification : This technique involves making a much smaller incision (around 3 millimeters or less) through which the lens is emulsified and aspirated.

FLACS (Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery) : This advanced technique uses a femtosecond laser to create precise incisions and to perform capsulotomy and lens fragmentation.

FLACS (Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery)</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Manual small incision cataract surgery (SICS) : In SICS, the incision size is between 6 to 8 millimeters.
