Presenting complaints are Fever (>38.3\u02daC), swelling of the limb, pain, systemic symptoms and increased levels of total leucocyte counts, ESR and CRP. Blood Culture is positive for staphylococcus aureus in 60% cases.</li><li>\u2022 Option A. Osteomyelitis.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Anthrax. This commonly presents with non-specific prodromal symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, and sweats which progress to dyspnea and ultimately, respiratory failure and hemodynamic collapse. In cutaneous anthrax, the diagnosis is mostly clinical. However, confirmation can be established by the culture of the lesion, serologic testing, or punch biopsy. In inhalation anthrax, CT scanning of the chest is more sensitive. Sputum culture, gram stain, and blood cultures are not helpful in the acute phase.</li><li>\u2022 Option C. Anthrax.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Actinomycosis. It frequently occurs at an oral, cervical or facial site, usually as a soft tissue swelling, abscess or mass that is often mistaken for neoplasm. Angle of jaw is most commonly involved. Involvement of bone is usually due to adjacent soft tissues. Mandible is most commonly involved. Vertebrae (spreading from lung or gut) or pelvis (spreading from cecum or colon) may also be involved. Infection of an extremity is uncommon. X-ray show cystic areas of bone destruction with concomitant bone formation and bone destruction.</li><li>\u2022 Option D. Actinomycosis.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Educational Objective:</strong></p><ul><li>\u27a4 Educational Objective:</li><li>\u27a4 The given symptoms and the smear result is suggestive of Madura mycosis. The filamentous structures observed on a KOH smear in Madura mycosis are hyphae which are the thread-like structures that make up the body of a fungus. In Madura mycosis, the hyphae are typically thick-walled and septate (divided into compartments). This presents as swelling of the extremity, pus discharge, and multiple sinuses.</li><li>\u27a4 The given symptoms and the smear result is suggestive of Madura mycosis.</li><li>\u27a4 The given symptoms and the smear result is suggestive of Madura mycosis.</li><li>\u27a4 The filamentous structures observed on a KOH smear in Madura mycosis are hyphae which are the thread-like structures that make up the body of a fungus.</li><li>\u27a4 The filamentous structures observed on a KOH smear in Madura mycosis are hyphae which are the thread-like structures that make up the body of a fungus.</li><li>\u27a4 In Madura mycosis, the hyphae are typically thick-walled and septate (divided into compartments).</li><li>\u27a4 In Madura mycosis, the hyphae are typically thick-walled and septate (divided into compartments).</li><li>\u27a4 This presents as swelling of the extremity, pus discharge, and multiple sinuses.</li><li>\u27a4 This presents as swelling of the extremity, pus discharge, and multiple sinuses.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Swelling and tenderness may also be present around the area of pain. I nitial radiographs are normal early in the course of a stress fracture.
