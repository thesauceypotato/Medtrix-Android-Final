      "explanation": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u2022 Let's analyze the effects of each option:</li><li>\u2022 A. Epinephrine (Adrenaline): Epinephrine stimulates both alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) adrenergic receptors. It causes vasoconstriction (\u03b11) leading to increased systolic and mean blood pressure, but it also strongly stimulates \u03b21 receptors in the heart, leading to increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. While it increases pulse pressure, the reflex bradycardia seen in the figure is less typical as its direct \u03b21 effects would counteract it, or the reflex would be masked.</li><li>\u2022 B. Norepinephrine (Nor-epinephrine): Norepinephrine primarily stimulates \u03b11 receptors (causing potent vasoconstriction) and \u03b21 receptors (in the heart). The strong \u03b11-mediated vasoconstriction leads to a marked increase in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure. This significant rise in blood pressure then triggers a strong baroreceptor reflex. The baroreceptors sense the increased pressure and respond by increasing parasympathetic (vagal) tone to the heart, leading to reflex bradycardia (a decrease in heart rate) despite the direct \u03b21 stimulation of the heart. This perfectly matches the figure.</li><li>\u2022 C. Isoprenaline (Isoproterenol): Isoprenaline is a non-selective beta agonist, strongly stimulating \u03b21 and \u03b22 receptors. It causes vasodilation (\u03b22), leading to a decrease in diastolic blood pressure and often a slight decrease in mean arterial pressure. It strongly increases heart rate and cardiac contractility (\u03b21). This is the opposite of what is shown in the figure for blood pressure and heart rate.</li><li>\u2022 D. Dopamine: Dopamine's effects are dose-dependent. At low doses, it stimulates D1 receptors causing renal and mesenteric vasodilation. At moderate doses, it stimulates \u03b21 receptors, increasing heart rate and contractility. At high doses, it stimulates \u03b11 receptors, causing vasoconstriction. While it can increase blood pressure at high doses, it usually increases heart rate directly or reflexively, and the combined pattern shown (marked increase in all pressures with reflex bradycardia) is not its primary or most characteristic effect compared to norepinephrine.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u2022 Phentolamine is an \u03b1-adrenergic blocker that prevents the vasoconstrictor effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) on \u03b1 receptors. When adrenaline is given after pretreatment with phentolamine, there is a reversal of its normal effects (vasoconstriction), leading to severe hypotension because the \u03b2-adrenergic effects (such as vasodilation and increased heart rate) become unopposed. This results in an exaggerated vasodilatory response, causing a drastic drop in blood pressure.</li><li>\u2022 Why the other options are incorrect: A. Repeated administration of ephedrine decreases its effect on blood pressure \u2013 Incorrect:</li><li>\u2022 This refers to tolerance, which is a different phenomenon, where repeated administration of ephedrine can lead to reduced efficacy over time. However, this is not related to Dale's vasomotor reversal.</li><li>\u2022 B. High dose of acetylcholine after pretreatment with atropine produces increase in blood pressure and heart rate \u2013 Incorrect:</li><li>\u2022 Atropine blocks the parasympathetic effects, leading to increased heart rate and blood pressure.

Increase in pulse pressure is produced by intravenous administration of isoprenaline \u2013 Incorrect:</li><li>\u2022 Isoprenaline (isoproterenol) is a \u03b2-adrenergic agonist, which generally causes vasodilation (due to \u03b2? receptor activation) and increased heart rate (due to \u03b2? receptor activation).

This results in muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. In MG, the weakness typically affects the ocular muscles first, leading to ptosis and diplopia (double vision). Symptoms tend to improve after the administration of neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which increases the availability of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.</li><li>\u2022 The diurnal variation in symptoms (better in the morning and worse in the evening) is another hallmark feature of Myasthenia gravis, as the neuromuscular junction becomes fatigued over the course of the day.</li><li>\u2022 Why the other options are incorrect: B.

It is caused by autoantibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels. LEMS usually presents with proximal muscle weakness (e.g., difficulty standing up from a seated position) and impaired deep tendon reflexes. Unlike MG, LEMS symptoms improve with activity, not worsen. The hallmark of LEMS is the improvement of weakness with exercise, not fatigue during the day.</li><li>\u2022 C. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy \u2013 Incorrect:</li><li>\u2022 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness, usually beginning in childhood.

Dermatomyositis \u2013 Incorrect:</li><li>\u2022 Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy characterized by muscle weakness (often proximal) and skin rashes (such as a heliotrope rash and Gottron's papules).

The alkaloids in dhatura (e.g., scopolamine, hyoscyamine) inhibit acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, leading to these characteristic toxic effects. In severe cases, dhatura poisoning can result in coma and death due to its systemic effects.</li><li>\u2022 Why the other options are incorrect: A. Foxglove \u2013 Incorrect:</li><li>\u2022 Foxglove (digitalis) contains compounds called cardiac glycosides, which primarily affect the heart by inhibiting the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, leading to arrhythmias and bradycardia (slow heart rate), not symptoms like dry skin, elevated body temperature, or dilated pupils. The symptoms described are more characteristic of anticholinergic poisoning, not digitalis toxicity.</li><li>\u2022 B. Poppy seeds \u2013 Incorrect:</li><li>\u2022 Poppy seeds contain trace amounts of opioid alkaloids (such as morphine and codeine), but they are not known to cause the anticholinergic symptoms of dilated pupils, dry skin, and elevated body temperature. Opioid toxicity would cause miosis (constricted pupils), respiratory depression, and bradycardia, not the signs mentioned in the question.</li><li>\u2022 C. Cannabinoid \u2013 Incorrect:</li><li>\u2022 Cannabinoids (such as those found in marijuana) generally cause euphoria, drowsiness, increased heart rate, and conjunctival injection (red eyes), but they do not typically produce the anticholinergic symptoms described. While cannabinoid toxicity can lead to altered mental status, it does not typically cause dilated pupils and dry skin as seen with dhatura poisoning.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

      "explanation": "<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>\u2022 Morphine is a strong opioid analgesic often used to relieve pain. However, in the case of biliary colic, morphine can increase sphincter of Oddi tone, leading to worsening of the pain. The sphincter of Oddi is a muscular valve that controls the flow of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum. When morphine causes it to contract, it can increase pressure in the biliary tract, worsening the pain associated with biliary colic.</li><li>\u2022 Why the other options are incorrect: B \u2014 Diclofenac:</li><li>\u2022 Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDs, like diclofenac, are typically used for pain relief in biliary colic and are less likely to increase the pressure in the bile ducts compared to opioids. Therefore, it would not worsen the pain in the same way morphine would.</li><li>\u2022 C \u2014 Nefopam:</li><li>\u2022 Nefopam is a non-opioid analgesic with a different mechanism of action than opioids. It is also less likely to affect the sphincter of Oddi and would not worsen the pain in biliary colic.</li><li>\u2022 D \u2014 Etoricoxib:</li><li>\u2022 Etoricoxib is another NSAID, like diclofenac, and works by inhibiting COX-2.

The risk is particularly high if the mother has a primary HSV infection (i.e., the first episode during pregnancy) or if the lesions are present at the time of labor.</li><li>\u2022 Acyclovir:</li><li>\u2022 Acyclovir (or valacyclovir) is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes simplex infections. It is often administered during pregnancy to help reduce viral shedding and reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. However, while Acyclovir can help manage the infection, it does not eliminate the need for planning the mode of delivery.</li><li>\u2022 Elective Cesarean Section (C-Section):</li><li>\u2022 The best approach to prevent neonatal herpes during delivery is a cesarean section (C-section) if there are active lesions present at the time of delivery. A C-section reduces the risk of the baby coming into direct contact with the virus in the birth canal.</li><li>\u2022 Why the other options are incorrect: B. Give Acyclovir and wait for spontaneous vaginal delivery:</li><li>\u2022 While Acyclovir is useful for treating the infection, waiting for spontaneous vaginal delivery in the presence of active genital herpes (especially if the woman has primary infection or active lesions) increases the risk of neonatal herpes. C-section is the recommended delivery option in this case.</li><li>\u2022 C. Give Acyclovir and do labor induction:</li><li>\u2022 Inducing labor when there are active herpes lesions is not advised because a vaginal delivery with active lesions increases the risk of neonatal herpes. A C-section is the safer option.</li><li>\u2022 D. Induction of labor:</li><li>\u2022 Inducing labor without considering the presence of active genital herpes lesions is not appropriate, as a vaginal delivery with active lesions poses a risk to the baby. Elective C-section is the preferred management.</li></ul>\n<p></p>",

Rifampicin is teratogenic:</li><li>\u2022 While Rifampicin can have some side effects, it is not teratogenic (i.e., it does not cause birth defects).
