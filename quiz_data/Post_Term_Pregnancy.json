      "explanation": "<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><p>Induction labor Before formulating the management, o ne should be certain about the maturity of the fetus. Assessment of fetal wellbeing is done by twice weekly non stress test , biophysical profile and ultrasonographic estimation of amniotic fluid volume. Oligohydramnios has been associated with abnormal fetal CTG, umbilical cord compression and meconium-stained liquor. Modified biophysical profile (NST and amniotic fluid volume) is commonly done. Amniotic fluid pocket < 2 cm and AFI < 5 cm indicates induction of labor or delivery because liquor stsart decreasing after 40 weeks and so, it is indication for induction of labour .</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) The amniotic fluid index is measured by dividing the uterus into four quadrants The linea nigra is used to divide the uterus into right and left halves. The umbilicus serves as the dividing point for the upper and lower halves. The transducer is kept parallel to patient's longitudinal axis and perpendicular to the floor</p>\n<p><strong>Extraedge:</strong></p><p>UNCOMPLICATED : the expectant attitude is extended for 7\u201310 days past the expected date and thereafter labor is induced. Induction: Induction of labor reduces the rate of cesarean delivery and perinatal mortality. If the cervix is unripe, it is made favourable by vaginal administration of PGE2 gel . This is followed by low rupture of the membranes. Oxytocin infusion is added when required. Cervical length (TVS) < 25 mm is a predictor of successful induction of labor.</p>\n<p></p>",

The main clinical significance of post-term pregnancy is dysmaturity or macrosomia. Option: D- Following birth: (1) Chemical pneumonitis, atelectasis and pulmonary hypertension are due to meconium aspiration; (2) Hypoxia (low Apgar scores) and respiratory failure; (3) Hypoglycaemia and polycythaemia (this can be seen because of hyperinsulinemia) and (4) Increased NICU admissions.</p>\n<p></p>",

Pregnancy between 41-42 weeks is called prolonged pregnancy. Most common cause of post term pregnancy is wrong dates so, a careful review of menstrual history is important in all such cases If the patient is sure about her date with previous history of regular cycles, it is a fairly reliable diagnostic aid in the calculation of the period of gestation. But in cases of mistaken maturity or pregnancy occurring during lactational amenorrhoea or soon following withdrawal of the pill, confusion arises. In such cases, the previous well documented antenatal records of first visit in the first trimester if available, are useful guides.</p>\n<p><strong>Highyeild:</strong></p><p>Once the menstrual history is confirmed, investigations like USG and amniocentesis are done: To confirm fetal maturity To detect any evidence of placental insufficiency Causes of Post-term pregnancy: Wrong dates: due to inaccurate LMP (most common).
