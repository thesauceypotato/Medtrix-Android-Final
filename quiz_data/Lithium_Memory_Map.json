Lithium is believed to cause nephrogenic DI by interfering with ADH signalling in the collecting duct cells, which results in reduced expression of water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in these cells and subsequently an elevated ADH in an attempt to compensate.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Hypothalamic injury can result in central DI with low ADH levels. However, this patient's elevated ADH levels suggest nephrogenic DI. Option: B. Elevated ADH levels due to exogenous secretion in patients with paraneoplastic syndrome results in a syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) which, unlike the condition in this patient, manifests as excessive free water retention, euvolemic hyponatremia, and high urine osmolality. Option : C. Individuals with psychogenic polydipsia (PP) also present with polyuria, polydipsia, and low urine osmolality levels , as also seen in this patient. However, PP causes the suppressed release of ADH, low serum Na+, and low serum osmolality levels due to the dilutional effect of excessive water intake. Furthermore, patients with PP do not have dehydration like this patient.</p>\n<p></p>",

Therefore, pregnancy should be ruled out and kidney and thyroid function should be assessed before beginning treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Random:</strong></p><p>Explanation for Incorrect Options:- Option: A. Because agranulocytosis and increased serum transaminase are side effects of valproate , blood tests should be done regularly during pharmacotherapy. Lithium is metabolized and excreted readily , meaning liver function tests would not be required. Option: C. Suicidal ideation is rarely seen during acute manic episodes in bipolar disorder. In contrast, it is a possible clinical feature in depressive episodes. Lithium and some of the other first-line drugs for bipolar disorder may have cardiologic side effects (e.g., prolonged QT intervals, and arrhythmias). ECG before and during treatment is recommended, but echocardiography is not routinely performed before initiating treatment. Option: D. Cognitive behavior therapy is an important component of management in bipolar disorder. However, this patient shows acute manic symptoms, so psychotherapy is difficult to execute in the current situation .</p>\n<p></p>",

Option B - Discontinuing lithium is an inappropriate choice because the patient has a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and has been stable on the drug of choice for that disorder, which is lithium. Option C - A dexamethasone suppression test has been used in the past to help confirm major depressive disorder since severely depressed patients show non-suppression of cortisol after the administration of dexamethasone.</p>\n<p></p>",
