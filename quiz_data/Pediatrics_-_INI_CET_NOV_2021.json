Most babies learn to roll from their back to stomach at around 5 to 6 months. Rolling from stomach to back typically follows around 6 to 7 months. Tummy time helps in developing rolling skills and upper body strength. Individual variation exists, and some babies may achieve rolling milestones earlier or later.

Seizures are more frequently observed in patients with sodium disorders (especially hyponatremia), hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesaemia. Since electrolyte disturbances are, at least in the early stages, generally not associated with morphologic changes in CNS, the neurologic manifestations are typically reversible. However, seizures and the electrolyte disturbance itself can lead to structural alterations, so that the underlying electrolyte disturbances should be recognized and treated before the brain tissue injury becomes permanent. Disorders of sodium and osmolality can be responsible for an encephalopathy characterized by depression of neuronal activity, with confusion, headache, psychomotor slowing and lethargy as the major clinical manifestations, usually associated with signs of irritability. Hypercalcemia and hypermagnesemia may also produce both a neuronal depression with encephalopathy and neuronal irritability.
